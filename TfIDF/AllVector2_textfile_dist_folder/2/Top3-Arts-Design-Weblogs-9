 Love Made Visible Tina Peter, Martha Stewart Weddings I had the pleasure of designing the wedding invitations for my friends Tina Peter awhile ago and now their sangeet and wedding is featured on the front page of Martha Stewart Weddings ! For their Hindu wedding, Tina wanted a colorful and cheerful wedding invitation inspired by a favorite textile pattern with touches of gold foil her and my favorite. Their whole wedding was absolutely stunning so please make sure to check it out . This blog has been in severe neglect in the past few years but new and exciting things are a-brewing. Until my new space is up and running, please stay in touch through email , Twitter , Pinterest and Instagram . I will be sure to write again when my new online home is ready. xo Photos: A Couple of Cameras . As featured in Martha Stewart Weddings, Real Weddings .
