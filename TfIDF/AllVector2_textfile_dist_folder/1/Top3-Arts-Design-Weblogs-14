 ReubenMiller ARCHIVE SUBSCRIBE ABOUT TWITTER CONTACT December 06, 2012 the ultimate diy coffee cup sleeve I bought some disposable Dixie Insulair® hot cups last night. But cool insulation-themed name aside, they didnt feel insulated (read: blazing hot) with coffee inside. So, I began digging around in the cupboards for a cup cozy or some other cup I could use. I spied these fire-engine-red Chinet cups, which I picked up a Costco some time back. I put my hot cup of coffee inside. It worked! The ridged walls help to insulate and keep my hands cool. All it needed was a better fit, which was easily accomplished by cutting off the base of the cup. Any similar cup should probably work, too. Experiment with any large plastic cup that has some sort of texture or ridges in the walls and see what works best.

The bike costs only$60 for the standard model, or $90 if you opt for the extra attachments like a removable motor. With a production costs of only $9-12, this eco-friendly bike could be the next solution to transportation woes for both developing nations and hipsters alike.

Ive also been looking at a lot of fresh inspiration. Heres a collection of things Ive been working on and cool things I thought you might enjoy seeing. I saw these awesome wine bottle illustrations by Lydia Nichols over at The Dieline . Speaking of The Dieline, the Package Design Conference in Boston is around the corner. I plan to be there with Yael (shes speaking on Sunday). I decided I needed a second pair of glasses. I do a lot of work outdoors and in the workshop, so I need a second pair so I dont screw up the one I have. I was looking at a bunch of styles over at Warby Parker . They must be pretty popular because Im still waiting for a bunch of styles to become available for Home Try-On. Which style do you think I should get? Our studio, Miller Creative, just completed the redesign for Cybele Pascals blog. I think it looks pretty awesome. I finally got brave and started my trial of Basecamp, which is a project management tool. Unlike Yael, I am very slow to embrace something new. Basecamp seriously rocks. Its perfect for managing our projects. All I need now is something useful to manage clients and potential clients. I thought this video was funny. My favorite wine right now is The Coalition . Its made by Shirah Wine Company California.The packaging was designed by Miller . I recently spotted these over at DesignWorkLife . There are lots more of them at Lomography . We recently had the opportunity to recommend Keef for video production for one of our clients. Theyre the creative genius behind the video for Breukelen Distilling . As a suprise gesture of thanks they sent us a bottle of Breuklelens Glorious Gin (seen above). The video kinda makes you want to get up and create something. [Branding and packaging by I Love Dust ] Volkswagen used crowdsourcing to supply ideas for aconcept car. They then turned the top ideas into these amazing concept videos. You can see the video here . Now its time to wrap things up for the week, pull out some glasses and open the umbrella. The weekend is finally here. This is the song in my head for this time of day/week/year. Its by John Prine and Mac Wiseman . (The original song was first performed by Patti Page ) Have a great weekend.

Well for some reason there seems to be a craze going on painting nails with the totoro characters. Here is a how-to tutorial .

This poster drives home the point of our overmedicated society. I kind of think pharmaceutical companies have a little bit of a slanted agenda. Just a wee tiny bit. Created by Dan Meth .

No problem - you can do both at once - at least according to Todd Kundla , who makes wacky mutant bikes like the above Shoe Bike. Im guessing this is a good workout machine - it must take a lot more muscle to pedal this beast than any standard-issue bike. Photography by Jay Janner .
