We seek to understand the wonders of our Universe, to share them with the public, and to train the next generation of astronomers to carry on this mission. Our work focuses on observations of distant and nearby galaxies; the formation and evolution of structures in the Universe; understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter; and the formation of stars and planets. This wide array of exciting research topics is the basis for our vibrant and dynamic institute. Latest News Wichtiger Hinweis: . Important Note: ETH Zurich Imprint Disclaimer
