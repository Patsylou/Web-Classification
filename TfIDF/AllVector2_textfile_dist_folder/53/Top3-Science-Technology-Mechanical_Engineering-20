The teaching of the project takes different forms depending on the size of the group (from an individual up to 20 people), the period of time taken up by the project (some days up to several months), the subject of the project... Amongst the projects which come around each year, we principally see: Thematic Projects: Information Technology, Mathematics, Sciences and Material and Mechanical Engineering. (1st, 2nd and 3rd year) Inter-Promotion Projects “Innovaction-Prospective” Project: Training in Creativity and Managing an Innovative Project (1st and 2nd year) Research Project taught by fundamental research based in voluntary work Industrial Research Project (PRIE): 3rd year Pont Exam (1st and 2nd year) WORK PLACEMENTS Work placements in business are compulsory and one of them must be completed abroad. The duration is dependent on the year of study: Discover the company (during the holidays) Work placement as an assistant engineer (during the holidays) Final Year Project (April to September) International INTERNATIONAL LINKS CMF – SHERBROOKE Once students’ scientific knowledge has been assessed in the first year, it is possible for them to leave for a year to Quebec, to the University of Sherbrooke, in order to obtain a diploma in the second year in nanomaterials and high-tech characterizations . Students return to ISMANS for their third year in order to complete their degree through an intensive, modular schedule. Some return to Quebec at the end of third year, either for a work placement or to move there. COLLABORATION WITH THE FEDERAL UNIVERISTY OF KAZAN IN RUSSIA The exchange of researchers and students between ISMANS and this well renowned university in Russia has a long history which began with research collaborations. Every year, some former ISMANS students go to Kazan while former Russian students attend ISMANS as engineering graduates. This collaboration for double diplomas began in 2010 and a joint management of doctorate theses is in place between the laboratories of these two establishments. INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TAKE PART IN MASTER’S DEGREES - Professor E. Galea, specialist in evacuation simulation from the University of Greenwich - Professor I. Burgess, specialist in digital modeling of fires in civil engineering from the University of Sheffield, - Director of Research FNRS J.M. Franssen, specialist in digital modeling of fires in civil engineering from the University of Liège PHDS AND FOREIGN STUDENTS As an associated member of PRES LUNAM, ISMANS welcomes several national and international PhD students for their thesis work. Special Features INNOVATIVE DESIGN The initiative prize from Crédit Agricole We have been participating in the initiative prize, organized by Crédit Agricole, since 2004. During this period over thirty students have worked on the design and creation of more than ten projects, of which some have received the grand prize from the jury. ISMANS team and representatives in 2011 ISMANS students - winners of the grand prize in 2005 ISMANS students - winners of the grand prize in 2006 Photos are taken from Crédit Agricole’s website . ENTREPRENEURS We have been participating in the entrepreneurial challenge since 2008. During this period nearly 30 students have worked on the design and creation of nearly 10 business plans. One of our teams won the entrepreneurial prize in 2008 and since then several teams have ended up as the winners. The winners of the 2008 entrepreneurial prize. Two out of the three participants have continued their adventure in realizing their project and founding the society Labelia (environmental advice) . Double Diplomas Double Diplomas FRENCH-CAMEROONIAN DOUBLE DIPLOMA The creation of an excellent French-Cameroonian engineering course between the University of Yaoundé (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique, ENSP) and ISMANS allows for the obtainment of a double engineering degree specializing in structural calculations by finite elements. The duration of the course is two years. The first part happens in Cameroon by joining the ninth semester of the ENSP course. The second part happens in France, in Le Mans, and corresponds to semesters S8 and S9 at ISMANS. Between these two semesters, a work placement is carried out in the Mechanical Structures and Composite Materials Laboratory. The last part of the course can happen either in France or in Cameroon or in a different country where a final year work placement must be fulfilled. Assessment is carried out following the regulations set in place by these two establishments. Success in this course is rewarded by two diplomas: an engineering diploma from ISMANS and an engineering diploma from ENSP. The two diplomas confer to a Research Masters from ENSP. Three students with JC Craveur from the first French-Cameroonian double diploma.
