The Matyjaszewski Polymer Group continues to improve ATRP and prepare materials with controlled topology and composition suited for many applications, including automotive, building materials, medical, military and environmental fields using this robust technology. Professor Matyjaszewski founded the CRP Consortium to expedite transfer of knowledge on CRP procedures to industry in 2001.
