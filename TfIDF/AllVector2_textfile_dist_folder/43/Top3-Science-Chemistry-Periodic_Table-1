For elements that have no stable nuclides, the value enclosed in brackets indicates the mass number of the longest-lived isotope of the element. However three such elements ( thorium , protactinium and uranium ) do have a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, and for these an atomic weight is tabulated ( Atomic Weights of the Elements 2007 , Pure Appl. Chem. , Vol. 81 , No. 11, (2009) 2131-2156). Two new elements added to the Periodic Table! ONLINE CONTENTS Why is the periodic table shaped like it is? Organization of chemical elements in alphabetical order by their names (or symbols ) doesn't tell us anything about their properties but it is useful when searching for an element. We can list elements in order of increasing atomic number but it wouldn't be a periodic table any more. The periodic table is a chart that organizes the elements by increasing atomic number and their chemical and physical properties . Rows are arranged so that elements with similar properties fall into the same vertical columns ("groups"). Long form of the periodic table The lanthanides and actinides should actually be placed in the middle of the table as well, after lanthanum and actinium, but, because of their similarity to each other, they are removed from the middle to save space. Short form of the periodic table On periodni.com you can find two version of the periodic table EniG.
