 The group of Irish, Swedish and English eclipse chasers in China for the 22 July 2009 eclipse which we jokingly called Operation Dim Sun. Unfortunately they were totally clouded out along with millions of others along the track in China. A report on the Chinese trip will be added on their return when we have a look at the photos of the overall trip. Our trip to China is getting close. See here for details.
