Why is the mirror segmented? More Info Why are the mirrors hexagonal? More Info Why does the sunshield have 5 layers? More Info What kind of telescope is JWST? on Wikipedia. Why not assemble it in orbit? International Space Station (ISS) does not have the capability to assemble precision optical structures. Additionally, the environment around the ISS is not suitable for the exposed optics that JWST has and would have had the possibility to damage or contaminate the optics. The deployment of JWST happens far above Low Earth Orbit Who is James Webb? Read more about James E. Webb. Featured News WebbCam1 WebbCam2 Loading News ...
