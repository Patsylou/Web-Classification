Still playing catch up on the reviews, last February (jeez! was it that long ago) I made it out to Pointe Claire to see their group show called Under Construction. As you might expect, I was quite pleased and entertained by the show. It consisted of work by Thomas Corriveau , Martin Dèsilets , Guillaume Lachapelle and Sean Whalley , curated by Amanda Johnston and Alexandra Hofmaenner it was a smoothly done collection of some widely different art. I'm not entirely certain if I am as much a fan of M. Dèsilets' work as I am of the other three artists, but they all fit in very nicely to the overall theme (which if you hadn't quite figured out was 'architecture'). And this might also have to do with my sense of the show being somewhat fragmented. While each of the artists did work that had strong " I'm building stuff " happening, I missed any real connections between them, beyond that. Similar to Hampstead , Hochelaga , Saint Leonard and Pointe Claire all being part of Montreal, yet also being very different neighborhoods. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 28.5.07 links to this post There's all sorts of bafflegab and gobbledy-gook happening in this press release about yesterday's Montreal Museum's Day . Nowhere can I find any press release or other sort of factual documentation about attendance at the Journée des musées montréalais in 2006 which is sort of surprising since it was the 20th anniversary. But I scratch my head when last week they released something that ostensibly showed how 125,000 people participated in 2006 , and then this year they state that they " maintained last year's attendance once again " but they only got 108,000 people. A 14% drop in attendance isn't maintaining anything. This article by Cheryl Cornacchia in the Montreal Gazette does a better job of analyzing the results. Le Devoir on the other hand doesn't let the facts get in the way of a photo op posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 28.5.07 links to this post I just set up a Google News Alert to track who gets more internet press in English, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer or David Altmejd. Right now there are nine for Altmejd and five for Lozano-Hemmer .

It must mean that the Murray Guy Gallery is as fancy-ass and very prestigious as the biennale, right? And according to this article in ArtCal posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 24.5.07 links to this post Mr. Wenderoff is interning here at the gallery, this is what he wrote about the Bruce Nauman show There is one image from the Bruce Nauman exhibit at the Musee d’art contemporain de Montreal that really stayed with me. It was not the One Hundred Fish Fountain, nor was it Nauman’s famed The True Artist helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths. It wasn’t really even of a work of at. I was exploring a back passage which eventually lead me to Anthro/Socio (Rinde Spinning) room, where I saw a security guard trying to make sense of the situation. He looked absolutely baffled. After he noticed I was there too, and that I was part of the group of people that claim to understand it, he left me to experience the videos myself. I left about thirty seconds afterwards as I can only handle videos of screaming, spinning, upside down heads for so long. I don’t know if I have ever seen anyone as confused as that security guard, at least not in a real long time. The poor guy was just trying to figure out what the hell was going on in that room, and I’d assume also why anyone who would appreciate such things. If he had asked me, I wouldn’t have been able to tell him. I myself have no clue what the hell was going on in that room. The same can be said for the other rooms with videos, Clown Torture, Office Edit II and Square Dance. The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths (Window or Wall Sign) , 1967, Neon tubing with clear glass tubing suspension frame, 59 x 55 x 5 inches; Ed. 2/3, Collection Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands, ©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) Well that’ not entirely true. I was, to an extent, able to comprehend what was occurring, the issue I had more trouble resolving was why it was occurring. If I have the choice, which I usually do, I would rather not watch a video of a clown sitting on a toilet while other videos of said clown screaming “No No No No!” engulf me in noise. I worked one office job in my life, and it sucked, and when I left the office I left for good, so why would I want to watch a video of an office at night, as I could in Office Edit II? I’m sure it’s a social commentary of some sort in Nauman’s mind. Whatever. The videos, needless to say, did not do it for me. On the other hand, Nauman’s neon work in the Elusive Signs part of the exhibit is great. There are tons of wires needed for this part of the exhibit, and while they are quite visible, do not interfere. Flashing lights on some works do not distract the spectator when viewing a nearby piece. I have a soft spot for word games, so maybe I’m a bit biased when it comes to discussion of such pieces as None Sing Neon Sign, which is simply the words none, sing, neon, and sign, none sing being an anagram of neon sign. Maybe I'm just easily impressed, but I think that’s pretty cool. Run from Fear, Fun from Rear , 1972, Neon tubing with clear glass tubing suspension frame, two parts, 8 x 24 x 2 ½ inches each; Ed. 4/6, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Gerald S. Elliott Collection, ©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) There is also an installation piece called Helman Gallery Parallelogram where one walks through a tiny space in a narrow wall into a room lit with neon green, then out another tiny passageway. It hurt my eyes and made me feel a little claustrophobic. Probably should have read the sign that warns that spectators may feel confined in the installation before I went in there. One Hundred Fish Fountain, 2005, 97 poissons en bronze de 7 formes différentes, suspendus avec du fil en acier, inoxydable sur un treillis métallique. Dimensions approximatives du bassin : 7,6 m x 8,5 m x 20,3 cm, Avec l’aimable permission de la Donald Young Gallery, Chicago, ©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) Photo : Richard-Max Tremblay The highlight of the exhibit is the One Hundred Fish Fountain (which actually only contains 97 fish), located at the back of the exhibit. The sound of the water flowing overwhelms the neighbouring room, and draws you in to behold the fountain. That’s fine, there were some more videos in the neighbouring room, so not missing a whole lot by zooming through there towards the sound. It really does feel as though the fish are swimming in the flowing water, even though the fish are actually suspended above the stagnant pool of water. All in all it’s a solid exhibit, showing a fascinating artist who works with various media and definitely worth checking out. I just can’t help but feel the security guards working there think we must be crazy. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 24.5.07 links to this post Yesterday I was at the press preview for the Bruce Nauman exhibit that is opening at the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal tomorrow. As has become a very bad standard operating practice, in the press package there was a notice from SODRAC that stated in unequivocal terms that the pictures couldn't be cropped, and that there must be a copyright notice. Well, if you notice this is the current front page of the museum's website. The only copyright notice I see on it is this one: "© 2005-2007 Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal." Then if you look at this picture It appears to be the exact same one as on the front page of the museum's website, only not cropped. What gives? Why isn't SODRAC enforcing its policy with the museum? Or is there something I don't know? Then just so I don't have to spend any more time in court ('cuz it really ain't fun) the fine print Mean Clown Welcome, 1985, Tubes au néon montés sur monolithe de métal, Collection Udo and Anette Brandhorst Collection, Cologne, Avec l'aimable permission de la Donald Young Gallery, Chicago, ©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) [ update 5:04 pm: And can anyone find "©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007)" anywhere near or around this article in La Presse ?

" One problem, there are no crowds. I asked when I was there last Friday, and was told that the first weekend had been good and that they had received about 150 visitors at the Ecole Bourget. However last Thursday they had only received 36 visitors, and I was visitor 24 on Friday at about 3:30 pm. Then today I decided to return once again before writing anything, and they were closed. On the main entrance there was nothing except a sign saying "Open Everyday : 12:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m." Just like they say on the website . Over on the door to the annex, not the main entrance they have a small sign in French only that states that due to the Bus and Metro strike they had to change hours to Thursday to Sunday noon to 7 pm. Which is about as much balderdash as us getting snow in July. Because of the strike there is no service on the weekends , so I would understand if they closed on Saturday and Sundays - but they are open. Because of the strike there is public transportation during the morning rush hour and the evening rush hour , so I would understand if instead of " Everyday : 12:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m." like they write on their website , they opened everyday but at 9 AM and then closed at 6 PM. But to blame they strike and the inability of their employees to get into work is flat out wrong and incorrect. Plus I would imagine that most if not all of their staff were students who had been depending on that summer job. And that most of the money to pay them was from some government program. If I am correct, then what I want to know is where is the money going that they saved? All the art has been paid for, all the rent has been paid for, the transport has been paid for, so they decided that due to bad marketing and promotion they were going to lay off (or reduce the hours) of some students? I don't like it one bit. [ update 4:20 pm: Well we will be able to see if I am right or if it truly is because of the strike at the STM that they changed hours. Next Tuesday right after my court appearance I will be at the Ecole Bourget. The strike is only going to be lasting another 48 hours before the governement legislates everyone back to work . posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 23.5.07 links to this post Tuesday, May 22, 2007 Finally something went my way! if you've seen American Streamlined Design: The World of Tomorrow at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts you will know that there is a wicked cool record player there. And that David A. Hanks, the curator was witty enough to have decided to include a 78 rpm record of the song Streamlined Mama by Buddy Jones on it.

The previous job advertisements that I've seen are from May 2006 , February 16, 2007 and February 25, 2007 .

It seems like a lifetime ago, but it was only a couple of months. Dazibao had a not half bad exhibit featuring the work of John Duncan , Nestor Kruger , Erwin Wurm , Daniel von Sturmer , and Amon Yariv . Now that time has settled in I can only honestly remember the work of John Duncan, and Daniel von Sturmer. Mr. Duncan's was photographs of a bunch of shipping palates arranged in the Irish countryside. Nice simple one joke sorta stuff, see 'em, smile, and move on. Mr. von Sturmer's work was what made the show memorable. Two videos synchronized and then rotated 90 degrees so that the objects in the video appeared to be sliding along the floor, when in fact they were in a box being tilted. Bright and colorful standard household objects, against a plain white background it was a simple and effective way of disconnecting what you were seeing with your standard issue ideas of gravity and how it works. Although now that I look into hos work it appears that we got a crippled version of screen test, as on Mr. von Sturmer's website it states "4 Screen video installation and Kinetic object" and I only saw a two-channel video at Dazibao. I wonder how Susan Edelstein's article in Prefix Photo posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 20.5.07 links to this post I don't normally read Walrus magazine , mostly because way too much of it is money-walled. But I came across an article written by Adam Gopnik about (ostensibly) the current state of affairs in the museum biz. In a nutshell, he uses alliteration to try to show how museums have moved from being mausoleums, to machines, to maybe malls but mostly mindful. Mr. Gopnik, can I introduce you to Paul Werner ? One of the major problems with Mr. Gopnik's thesis, is that he does not even acknowledge the explosion of museums here, there and everywhere. In New Zealand there is approximately one museum for every 8,000 residents . In Canada there are more than 2,500 museums . Mr Gopnik probably would think that the Groupe Bizot is too large, and really should be reduced to only including museums in New York, Paris and London. The idea all museums are in lock step, thinking and moving to the same beat in the same direction is about as preposterous as a mustache on the Mona Lisa . Then, when he writes " One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that art, which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. " I really get annoyed. That he furthers the cliche that contemporary art is incomprehensible is just flat out stupid. Try that sentence this way: One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that literature , which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. or if you prefer One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that film , which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. Film is understandable, as is literature. When either, or both get tossed into an institution (say a university) it is the duty of the institution to elevate whatever is being brought in. One easy way to elevate something is through use of three syllable words, or academic language if you prefer. When and where did museums become like universities? I think it is much more helpful to consider museums like concert halls for music. Or libraries for books.
