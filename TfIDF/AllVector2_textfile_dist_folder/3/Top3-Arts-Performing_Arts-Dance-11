This site last updated: 12/21/05 2:51 PM Welcome to the Marriage of Music and Dance I have been fortunate in life to be able to totally immerse myself in two art forms. Dance and music have become, for me, interdependent; I rarely enjoy one without the other. I would be happy to share my passion for this synergy with you through the offerings of this website. My book ( Dance and Music in English, and Tanz und Musik in German) is a guide to dance accompaniment for musicians and dance teachers. The CDs are piano accompaniment for ballet classes. The musings have nothing to do with dance or music, but they are things that deeply engage my thinking. Maybe they will yours, too.
