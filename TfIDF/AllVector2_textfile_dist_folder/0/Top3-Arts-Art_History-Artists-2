Her youth was spent between Africa and Germany and her first show was in Berlin in 1919, but she refused to travel or show in that country between 1933 and 1945. Although her work was termed immoral and subject to police investigation in South Africa, she won international acclaim, and her paintings have since broken auction records for art of that country.
