AHNCA's goal is to foster dialogue and communication among those who have a special interest in the field of nineteenth-century art and culture. Nineteenth-century art is broadly defined as all art that was produced between the American Revolution and the First World War, regardless of geographic boundaries. AHNCA is an affiliated society of the College Art Association and as such organizes a regularly scheduled session at each CAA annual conference. An additional session offers opportunities to younger scholars to present papers related to their doctoral research. AHNCA holds a business meeting at each CAA conference. The association publishes two newsletters each year, as well as an annual membership directory.
