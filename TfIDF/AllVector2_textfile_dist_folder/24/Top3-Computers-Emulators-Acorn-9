Sourceforge project page 03/02/2002 OSLib 13/12/2001 Hello World 31/07/2001 30/05/2001 Chris Rutter died in March, and this is bit of a blow, both personally and for the project. I've got my university finals in about five days, after which I'm moving to York and starting a consultancy firm 25/12/2000 08/08/2000 very geeky holiday 28/07/2000 Later on... 27/07/2000 23/07/2000 Alice has been visiting, but Chris Rutter has been working on a replacement ARM emulation (called sleeve ... groan...) and Nick Burrett has given me permission to distribute a similar project of his which can run GCC; it's available here 19/07/2000 Sourceforge project page and help me out! There's another page 18/07/2000 15/07/2000 14/07/2000 Silent Hill 13/07/2000 strrchr Downloading riscose Get the nightly code snapshot if you just want a quick look.

Helping out Terms of distribution Sourceforge project page , Riscose can be distributed either in source or binary form under the terms of the GNU Public License Useful links sleeve is the ARM emulation developed by Chris Rutter which will soon be the preferred core for riscose; RISC OS Ltd. (who, at the time of writing, have fewer full-time programmers working on their product than this project has :-) ) ROX is a RISC OS-type desktop environment for Linux machines, mimicking the look + feel (including a Filer clone and other goodies) rather than doing any emulation; Darren Salt's web pages featuring ports of many GNU tools, which I'm planning to use for testing Zap , the RISC OS programmers editor and swiss-army knife which has been described as `better than sex' Sourceforge , the generous people who host this site Dave Gilbert's web site , a guy who's already written a hardware-level emulation of an Archimedes Robin Watts has all sorts of interesting documents on his web page, not least an ARM processor cheat sheet Phil Blundell has done some experiments to make RISC OS binaries run under ARMLinux and wrote a program and kernel patch that runs Twin Sourceforge are the generous people who host this site. SWARM is another ARM emulation, written in C++ ARMphetamine is another ARM emulation (dynamically recompiling, no less) this times optimised for speed. I'd have used it instead of the ARMulator but it looks complicated at the moment :-) Brandy is a reimplementation of BBC BASIC V in ANSI C, and ripe for integrating into riscose one day. !Virtual is a RISC OS program that traps just enough SWIs to allow RISC OS compilers to believe they have virtual memory available. A neat trick, and a prototype of what we're trying to achieve here :-) Mailing list If you want to chat about it, or help development, or at least know when there'll be some code released, mail riscose-subscribe@lists.soup-kitchen.net Matthew Bloch, mattbee@soup-kitchen.net
