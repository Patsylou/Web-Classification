 micro64 micro64 Aimed to become the most accurate C64 Emulator. a High-End Computer is strongly recommended. The highly advanced successor of brotkaestchen (fr-051) from BeRo / farbrausch . Currently micro64 has two different VIC II emulation modes (both are half-cycle exact): single pixel dot clock exact (very accurate, slow) and dynamic pixel block-wise (quite fast, even on slower machines). Normally you shouldn't notice any differences, except in demos with a lot of VIC II trickery. If your computer is fast enough you definitely should use the accurate mode. Status: Still under heavy development! Due to constant nagging, we decided that it's time to prove that micro64 is not vaporware. Enjoy the current state pre-release. Test stuff. Report bugs. New builds will appear from time to time. Feel free to check out the micro64 discussion google group and drop some feedback or get in contact with the developer. Next big thing on the list is a massive GUI rework, so come on and join in! You can discuss micro64 related things also in the micro64 forum .

It's powered by a 6510-to-X86 Dynarec Engine. Hyper64 is a working proof-of-concept of an experimental C64 emulator implementation without resorting to a conventional CPU emulation, but instead utilizing a realtime dynamic recompilation engine which disassembles, analyzes and re-assembles the 6510 machine code as native 32-bit x86 code. It further uses a fast translation code cache. The A, X and Y registers of the 6510 are mapped to the x86 AL, BL and CL registers and the 6510 flags are mapped via the x86 SAHF/LAHF opcodes. Although this yields to a lot of speed emulation-wise, it also has the side-effect of not being cycle exact, but instead being accurate on an instruction basis only. The VICII emulation is as far as I'm sophisticated complete but also not cycle exact. The same thing applies to the CIA emulation, whose accuracy is based on a VICII line basis.
