 Skip to content Home Constitution Officers and Board Calendar Resources Contact Home The  BioEngineering Student Society (BESS)  was founded in the year 2000 by several graduate students in an attempt to unite other students who share common research interests in bioengineering and applied biology at  Rutgers University . The group has been recognized by the  Rutgers Graduate Student Association,  and we are hoping to become a valuable resource for Bioengineering information at Rutgers and for the rest of New Jersey. Please take advantage of the material that we have collected here, and feel free to  send us some feedback  on anything that we might have missed. Feel free to email us at  rutgersbess@gmail.com  with any questions or comments. Copyright © 2013 Rutgers BESS. All Rights Reserved.
