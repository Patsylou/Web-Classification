Our Department is one of very few that brings together the excitement and challenge of both aeronautical and automotive engineering. Our reputation for excellent teaching and topical research is built on a long and successful history. Automotive engineering started in 1919 and Aeronautical in 1935. From small beginnings we are now housed in a purpose built, 14M facility that includes laboratories, workshops, wind-tunnels, a flight simulator and a technical display area where a recently retired military aircraft takes pride of place. We currently have 600 undergraduate students and 70 research students.
