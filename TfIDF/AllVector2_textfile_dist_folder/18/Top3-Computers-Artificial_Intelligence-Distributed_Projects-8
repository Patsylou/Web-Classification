Web surfers flocked to his Mindpixel Digital Mind Modeling Project website , and McKinstry's database of mindpixels -- "one-bit" pieces of knowledge -- swelled so quickly that his system became temporarily overloaded. But even though AI laymen took to McKinstry's decentralized, profit-sharing model of artificial intelligence (anyone who enters data gets a share in the company), many in the academic AI community balked at his plans. Now, it seems that the academy is changing its tune, as no less venerable an institution than MIT's Media Lab has decided to collaborate with McKinstry. "We think that the future of AI is to get the public involved," said Push Singh, an MIT graduate student in AI who runs a Media Lab project called OpenMind . Singh said that the public involvement that McKinstry has been able to spur so far -- Mindpixel already has almost 20,000 registered users -- would be an asset to OpenMind. Like Mindpixel, OpenMind is an AI machine that learns from user input. At the OpenMind website, users are presented with a series of stimuli -- photographs, phrases, or diagrams. Singh said that the computer learns "common sense" from users' aggregate response to a certain stimulus. For example, if the computer shows you a picture of a family at a picnic, you might type in, "Families like to spend time together." Someone else might write, "Picnics are fun when the weather permits." And yet another person could say, "I hope they didn't forget the Grey Poupon!" With enough such responses, some clearly more valuable than others, Singh said that the computer will learn a kind of common sense about families or picnics or mustard, and how they relate to each other. And with a little common sense, OpenMind will be able to at least approximate humanness, Sing said. But when Singh heard about McKinstry's project, and saw that it had already amassed a database of more than 175,000 mindpixels, he thought that OpenMind would benefit from a collaboration with it. According to both Singh and McKinstry, the OpenMind and the Mindpixel projects will tie their databases together "at the back end." This means that any user data entered into either of the projects will be accessible by the other. Each party emerges richer from the merger. OpenMind will almost instantly have a huge knowledge database, and McKinstry's project will be blessed with academic legitimacy. "It's nice to see some recognition from the academic AI community," McKinstry said from his home in Chile, where he operates the world's largest optical telescope . "What MIT brings to this is the prestige of the institution." Despite their collaboration, McKinstry and Singh each had no problem saying that the other's project is, ultimately, a lost cause. Indeed, just last week, Singh said that he didn't think that McKinstry was "embracing the open-source movement," since his project is commercial. After speaking to McKinstry extensively over the weekend, Singh had changed his opinion a bit, saying that "Chris is a good guy" and that he appreciates McKinstry's enthusiasm. But Singh said that he still didn't think that McKinstry's "neural network" of one-bit facts would result in AI. He added that his project was superior to McKinstry's because it not only elicits facts from users, but also "the justifications for those facts." McKinstry, for his part, was equally critical of Singh's project. "(OpenMind) reminds me of where I was with this project six years ago," he said a bit dismissively, explaining that OpenMind lacked any way to ensure the "integrity" of the data users entered into the system. "Anyone can put in anything, and it isn't subject to validation," he said. McKinstry's project, by contrast, requires users to "validate" the data entered in by other users. Despite their differences, though, both scientists said that they thought the other's heart was in the right place. And neither doubted that each project -- and, if the machines come alive, mankind itself -- would benefit from this collaboration, this true meeting of databases.
