 BACK Clearing the Way... for every body (one way or another) Tracy C. Mansfield, PhD , CCC-SLP , ATP I have time for very few AT/AAC clients. I will occasionally present on assistive technology topics. I cannot accept anyone as a therapy client when there is any association with my current employment with Lane Education Service District (Eugene, OR). About Clyr CLYR stands for C ognitive L inguistic Y mage R efinement, where an ymage is a portrayal of what you have in mind. The Clyr group researches natural language processing with particular emphasis on ymage technology. We draw upon academic and industrial experience in cognitive science, linguistics, and systems design engineering, as well as professional certificates in technical training and systems administration.
