Functional outline of product Operation conditions Personal computer of Intel compatible CPU mounting About HPGL HPGL is the command set of the plotter control that is the abbreviation of Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language and was developed with the HP company. We can instruct various actions to the plotter from the computer with the combination of the alphabets of only 2 letters, to picture the diagram by this command set. Many computer aided design systems are supporting the plotter output in this HPGL command set. Also, many measuring device are supporting the function that outputs the measurement data with the HPGL command set. HP-GL/2 have added many functions to HPGL released first. HP RTL is instruction set of raster image data in abbreviated name of HP's Raster Transfer Language. It is included in HPGL data. There are the following data compression modes.
