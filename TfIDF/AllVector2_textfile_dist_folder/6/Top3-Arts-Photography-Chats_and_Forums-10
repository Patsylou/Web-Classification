Then I became agitated, then obsessed. Now Im just over it. Living with GAD is a pain in the butt, I hate when I become obsessed with things. In this case I just wanted to know why I was blocked. Posted in Blogging the disease | Tagged GAD , life sucks , oh well | Comments Off Were so sorry uncle Albert. Posted on 11/17/2013 by Jeff A Nope, as usual the title has nothing to do with the post. Ive been quite busy lately working on new songs and learning more tricks and techniques for my equipment. Posted in Skywarn , Weather | Tagged band , equipment , photos , weather | 1 Comment Well, what the heck? Posted on 10/13/2013 by Jeff A This was by far one of the mildest summers ever. No real severe storms to speak of. Only a few photos taken and they were only moderately ok. Posted in Weather | Tagged boring , none , Summer , weather | Comments Off Indiana weather blows. Posted on 9/16/2013 by Jeff A Still no significant weather to speak of, although it did finally rain. I  saw lightning flash off in  the distance and thats about it. Posted in Life | Tagged bored , Life , weather | Comments Off Well guess what? Posted on 9/2/2013 by Jeff A There have been no significant weather events here this summer. As a matter of fact, this has been the most boring summer I have ever witnessed. I guess I should just go out and take photos of something, anything. Posted in Weather | Tagged blah , weather | Comments Off Hiho everybody. Posted on 8/1/2013 by Jeff A My poor blog hasnt been updated in awhile. That should change soon as Im going to the Unity Christian Music Festival this month. I have tons of memory cards and extra rechargeables for the camera. Its going to be awesome and I should have tons of photos to share. Posted in Music , The Binding | Tagged Blog , festival , Life , music | Comments Off Well, this sucks! Posted on 6/10/2013 by Jeff A The weather so far has been very mild. Now while most people appreciate that, I like chasing. Chasing in Indiana is already challenging enough, but throw in a weather pattern that puts everything north or south of you and you have a recipe for boredom. The middle of the week looks to be promising but Ive been disappointed by the charts before. So yeah, still alive but nothing much to talk about here! My poor little blog is looking lonely.
