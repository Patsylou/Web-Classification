Send us an e-mail What Is KUK SOOL WON? Kuk Sool is a comprehensive martial arts system that is derived from the rich and varied martial arts techniques and traditions that have arisen in Korea through the ages. Kuk Sool is not a sport, nor is it simply another oriental self-defense method. Kuk Sool is a complete martial art that is dedicated to the cultivation of physical/mental strength and well-being, and to the preservation of traditional Korean martial arts. Although its origin may be traced back to antiquity, the present Kuk Sool system was formally devised only recently by Grandmaster "In Hyuk Sue", who has spent more than 50 years in single-minded practice and research in order to learn, compile, master, and organize more than 3,600 techniques that comprise Kuk Sool. He founded Kuk Sool Won (traditional Korean Martial Arts Association) in 1961, and brought it to the United States in 1974 to establish the World Kuk Sool Association, which was headquartered in San Francisco for 17 years and relocated to Houston, Texas in 1991. As of 1998, the Association has grown to include more than 400 member schools world-wide. For self-defense, Kuk Sool is unsurpassed. It combines kicking, punching, throwing, falling, choking, joint-locking and a myriad of weapons techniques into a beautiful and dynamic 'hard-soft' style, emphasizing speed and fluidity. In conjunction with physical training, meditation, breathing, acupressure and acupuncture techniques are employed to improve health, to develop internal power, and to retard the aging process. Philosophically, Kuk Sool stresses humility, self-discipline, self-control, loyalty and respect for others. Together, these aspects of Kuk Sool provide the means for attaining a long and healthy life. What are classes like? Each Kuk Sool Won school maintains its own class schedule, while all schools offer the same curriculum by certified instructors. Children's classes are about one hour long, and adult classes are two hours long. A typical class begins with a series of warm-up excercises designed to stretch and strengthen muscles and joints. After warm-ups, basic hand striking and kicking drills are performed followed by falling, self-defense techniques, and forms practice. Additional training in weapons and sparring may be arranged for intermediate and/or advanced levels. Each student is allowed to progress at his or her own pace, and encouraged to come in between classes for additional practice and instruction. Students attend as many classes as they wish each week.
