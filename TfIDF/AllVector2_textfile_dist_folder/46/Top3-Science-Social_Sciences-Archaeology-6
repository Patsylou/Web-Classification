A nearly complete point of dendritic chert, a mid-interval biface of translucent cryptocrystalline quartz, a mid to late-interval biface of dendritic chert, and a "dual,end-beveled" osseous rod, all of which exhibit various amounts of red ochre residue. Sarah L. Anzick Anzick is unusual for many reasons: at 12,800 years old, it is one of the oldest burials known in the Americas. The burial goods placed with the child represent one of the largest and most diverse collections of Clovis-aged working toolkit archaeologists have found to date. And now, DNA recovered from the site have provided rare genetic support for the American colonization from Asia.
