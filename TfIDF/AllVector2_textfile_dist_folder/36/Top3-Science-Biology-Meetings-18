Over time protocols and strategies have been tried and tested, amended and developed such that there are currently several different approaches. Protocol variations are evident at each step of the RT-qPCR process, from sample acquisition to data analysis (e.g. sample QC, experimental design, assay design and validation, normalisation, biostatistical interpretation, reporting, etc). It is now apparent that these adaptations may result in differences in the final biological conclusion of the study. This workshop is based upon the MIQE guidelines. Each step of the RT-qPCR process will be discussed and protocol variations illustrated practically. The student will be instructed in best practice and acceptable alternative strategies.
