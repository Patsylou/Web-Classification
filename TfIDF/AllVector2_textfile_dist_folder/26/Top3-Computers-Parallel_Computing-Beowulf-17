 University of California at Irvine Department of Physics AENEAS SUPERCOMPUTER Array of Enhanced Nodes Supercomputer UC Irvine professors Herbert Hamber(left) and Donald Dabdub, are using the Linux operating system in conjunction with 64 computers running in parallel. MARK BOSTER / Los Angeles Times Hardware The system is configured as one front-end system and 64 compute nodes. Each of the 65 nodes in the system has: Motherboard with Intel 440LX chipset and 300 MHz Pentium II processor 128 MByte 10-ns SDRAM memory 3.1 GByte Quantum EIDE U-DMA disk 100 Mbit/s ethernet adapter Los Angeles Times article here here Software The machines run RedHat Linux . EASY DQS for job scheduling.
