 MERCE CUNNINGHAM DANCE COMPANY DVD (NTSC) The diversity that each of these dancers showed in just 50 minutes was more than most dancers show in a lifetime. On December 29, 30 and 31, 2011, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company returned to New York Cityits home since it was founded in 1953to present six valedictory performances at Park Avenue Armory before disbanding. Performed across three stages spanning the Armory's soaring drill hall, Park Avenue Armory Event Throughout its history, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company mounted over 800 of these signature site-specific Events in unusual locations around the world. Events, as Merce Cunningham described them, consist of complete dances, excerpts of dances from the repertory, and often new sequences for the particular performance and place, with the possibility of several separate activities happening at the same time to allow not so much an evening of dance as the experience This three-DVD set was designed to give viewers the opportunity to create their own and completeexperience to witness MCDC's historic final performances. For the first time, the beautifully edited film of Park Avenue Armory Event (disc 1) is paired with uncut captures from each of the three stages, showing the full performance from every perspective, along with notes detailing the dances performed (disc two). As an added bonus, illustrating the full spectrum of Cunningham's artistic legacy, disc 3 includes recent and archival excerpts from each of DISC 1 PARK AVENUE ARMORY EVENT Playable in all regions
