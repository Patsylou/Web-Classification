 Careers Press Contact Search: Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research Close When More is Better Most cells in the body have two copies of each chromosome. But some cells, including the sub-perineurial glia cells (nuclei labeled green) encasing this larval fruit fly brain lobe, have an increase in DNA copy number. By studying cells like these, Whitehead Member Terry Orr-Weaver investigates how and why cells increase or decrease copies of their DNA.

News January 29, 2014 A protein-production tale of the tape: separating poly(A)-tail length from translational efficiency Whitehead Institute researchers have determined that poly(A) tails on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) shift their role in the regulation of protein production during early embryogenesis. This finding about the regulation of mRNA translation also provides insight into how microRNAs control protein production.  Featured Get a clue: CSI and the science of forensics Our team of junior detectives this February explored the techniques behind crime scene investigation and discovered how forensic science works in the real world. Support Please consider making a gift to Whitehead today Whitehead Institute relies heavily on philanthropy to maintain its pioneering programs in cancer research, immunology, developmental biology, stem cell research, regenerative medicine, genetics, and genomics. Gifts from individual donors, foundations, and corporations directly support Whitehead scientists pursuing breakthroughs that are transforming our understanding of biology and accelerating the development of therapies for a host of intractable human diseases. © Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research         Nine Cambridge Center    Cambridge, MA 02142 Follow us Facebook Twitter RSS
