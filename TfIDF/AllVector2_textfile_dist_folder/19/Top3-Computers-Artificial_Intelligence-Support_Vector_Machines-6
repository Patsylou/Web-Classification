Currently a next generation of ``smart phones'' and tablet-style PCs, which also rely on handwriting input, is further targeting the consumer market. However, in the majority of these devices the handwriting input method is still not satisfying. In current pdas people still use input methods, which abstract from the natural writing style, e.g. in the widespread Graffiti. Thus there is demand for a handwriting recognition system which is accurate, efficient and which can deal with the natural handwriting of a wide range of different writers.

Description of the frog on hand recognition system Data URL: UNIPEN Train-R01/V07 Reference link(s): Data link(s): UNIPEN Train-R01/V07 Entered by: Claus Bahlmann bahlmann@informatik.uni-freiburg.de - Monday, September 09, 2002 at 11:52:27 (GMT) Comments: Usual SVM kernels are designed to deal with data of fixed dimension. However, on-line handwriting data is not of a fixed dimension, but of a variable-length sequential form. In this respect SVMs cannot be applied to HWR straightforwardly. We have addressed this issue by developing an appropriate SVM kernel for sequential data, the Gaussian dynamic time warping (GDTW) kernel. The basic idea of the GDTW kernel is, that instead of the squared Euclidean distance in the usual Gaussian kernel it uses the dynamic time warping distance. In addition to on-line handwriting recognition the GDTW kernel can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g. speech recognition or genome processing. Experiments have shown superior recognition rate in comparison to an HMM-based classifier for relative small training sets (~ 6000) and comparable rates for larger training sets.
