Savate (pronounced Suh-vat) is an elegant form of combat. It dates from the early 1800s and is a mixture of French kicking and English boxing, making it a rare European martial art. The strikes are taught to be precise, effective and fluid. Savate was formalised in 1830 when a French fighter was, reportedly, beaten by an English boxer and merged the best of each style to create Boxe-Francaise. The art was nearly extinguished with the casualties of two World Wars, but today enjoys a resurgence with a worldwide following. Will it hurt? No. Our training is about tactics, angles and psychology - not hitting hard. It is a game of touch. In Assaut Savate the successful fighter wins through inventive techniques, not by brute force. A controlled contact art minimises the risk of injury and so has the chance to improve your body rather than damage it. Do I need to be fit? Not to start with. You will get fitter.
