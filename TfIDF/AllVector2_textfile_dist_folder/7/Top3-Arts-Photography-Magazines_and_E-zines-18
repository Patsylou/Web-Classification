If your project is going from an original photo or series of photos to the printed page on a printing press, it's a costly process with lots of variables that can diminish the final result and end in disappointment. It takes LOTS of experience to recognize the nuances of color as they are reproduced through the mixtures of inks on the press and you have one chance to get it right! From scanning to color balancing to file preparation to the final press check, each link in the chain is critical to achieve excellence. We know the process inside-out and have the proven experience to help you confidently achieve your desired results. Equally important is the presentation of text and graphics complementing the photos. Again, experience is the key to maximizing your success the kind of experience that takes many years to accrue. We have experts on staff to assist in all of these areas photo editing, overall design concept, page-to-page and spread-to-spread design and layout issues, and the preparation of clean and thoughtfully-edited text to invitingly guide the viewer through the printed piece.
