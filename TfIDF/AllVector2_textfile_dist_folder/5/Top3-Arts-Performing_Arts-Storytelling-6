Fox Valley Memory Loss Project creates TimeSlips Town in Appleton, Wisconsin TimeSlips Facilitators from 10 facilities in the Fox Valley area worked together to create TimeSlips Town at the Thompson Community Center in Appleton on February 1st, 2014. TimeSlips Town was designed to demonstrate and celebrate the creativity of people who suffer from memory loss. This celebration featured with themes based on stories created by long-term care residents. There was a soda shop, a super hero shop, Grandmas front porch, a library, a pet shop, a shoe store, and others.
