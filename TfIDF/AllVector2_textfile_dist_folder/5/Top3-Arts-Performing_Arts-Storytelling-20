Somewhat more restrained. This is the door knocker I bought at San Telmo market. I propped them on the chair in the apartment, just to take the picture. I'd drooled over one of these in Lima, but didn't buy one until Buenos Aires. Soon I'll have it put on my front door in Kansas City. A modern door, still with that European look. Side by side in San Telmo. They may be old, but they're sturdy. The grafitti doesn't touch the doors. I love the letter flaps in these doors. Nice and neat, across the street from my modern apartment building.

Not as crooked as mine, but it's still noticeable. In my family, there is a range of crookedness. Mine are the second-most. blog post other than mine about crooked little fingers and wasted quite a bit of time reading all the "me, too!" comments before I came to my senses. I guess that's my version of nudging the person next to me and whispering. My nursery school art project, plaster painted with gold paint. Crooked as can be.

This was a school where I was in a music room, not a cavernous hall. It's so nice to have that intimate feel and not to need a microphone. These children had a good level of English. Even at schools where the level was lower, the kids understood this stretch. The students wear their uniforms, sometimes with their warm school jackets. I'm wearing my fleece vest and scarf in this school, as I did quite often. Schools in many countries are not kept as warm as in the US. It was winter in Argentina. This high school boy really was paying attention. He turned so that Yoli could take a picture that included the girls in the row ahead of him listening while leaning on each other's shoulders.
