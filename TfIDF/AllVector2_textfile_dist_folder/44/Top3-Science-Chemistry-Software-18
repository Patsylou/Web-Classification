 Galaxy 3D Molecule Viewer in JavaScript replaced the old applet viewer. Feb 2013 WebME 3.81 released, with several small improvements. June 2012 Molinspiration depiction providing among other improvements better layout of crowded fused rings. Feb 2012 RESTful web API to our services is available. May 2011 broad range of cheminformatics software tools free on-line services for calculation of important molecular properties (logP, polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and others), as well as prediction of bioactivity score for the most important drug targets (GPCR ligands, kinase inhibitors, ion channel modulators, nuclear receptors). Number of molecules processed per month exceeds 80,000! list of publications JME Editor property calculation and bioactivity prediction services is powered by the JSME molecule editor writen in JavaScript. Also our Galaxy 3D molecule visualizer Molinspiration Molecule Viewer allows visualization of collection of molecules encoded as SMILES or SDfile. SMILES is automatically transformed into molecule 2D representation by our depiction engine . Display of associated data, selection of molecules, built-in substructure search and export of selected molecules is supported. Viewer is written in Java, therefore is platform independent and may by used on any computer where the Java runtime is installed. Ask for free evaluation now!
