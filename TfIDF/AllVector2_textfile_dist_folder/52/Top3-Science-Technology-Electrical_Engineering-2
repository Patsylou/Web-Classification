Mostgenerators can provide 100% overload for start up purposes. A 1 Hp electric motor therefore will require 3-4kVA for start up.Once the 1 Hp electric motor has started, it will only consume 1 kVA leaving a extra 2-3kVAavailable for other appliances. However, the newer style generators may be moreefficient and capableof starting higher loads. Generator Selection The generator size must be equal or greater than the total consumption of all applications. The higher starting requirement must be taken into account accordingly. To maximise the generator potential, the largest electrical motor should be started on its own and further appliances should only be switched on thereafter.
