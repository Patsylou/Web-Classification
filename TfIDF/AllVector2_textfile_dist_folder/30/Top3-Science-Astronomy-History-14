 Biennial History of Astronomy Workshops Home Upcoming Workshop Past Workshops Group Photos Useful Links Contacts Biennial History of Astronomy Workshops Overview In 1993 the first Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop took place at the University of Notre Dame and launched what has become a stimulating forum for scholars of all levels and interests in the history of astronomy. Notable has been the workshop's attention to the teaching of the history of astronomy as well as the warm welcome given to graduate students and independent scholars. A workshop typically attracts 60-65 scholars who take part in a thematic program of talks, panel discussions, and, in some years, hands-on demonstrations. All aspects of the history of astronomy receive attention and across all time periods. Furthermore, the workshop's residential format ensures ample time outside of the scheduled meetings for participants to converse. When the weather allows, a visit to the Notre Dame Observatory is usually planned. An evening banquet with a well-known speaker tops off the workshop and helps to make this biennial gathering much anticipated among historians of astronomy. Upcoming Workshop The Twelfth Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop is scheduled for 24-28 June 2015 at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and will include a one-day trip to the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Chicago. Further details about this upcoming workshop, including the call for session and individual proposals, will appear towards the end of 2014.
