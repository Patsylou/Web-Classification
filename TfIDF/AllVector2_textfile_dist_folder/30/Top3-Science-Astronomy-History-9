 : 2012.08.09 - In 1997, when this research article was accomplished, formulas for astronomy constants were not as refined as today.

Rather than overwrite this step in examination of ancient astronomy, I'm leaving the article intact with the caveat that researchers should utilize the latest methods to examine the questions raised herein and should expect new results to vary.
