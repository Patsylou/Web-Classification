The data includes both the percentage of and a country′s actual population living within 10 kilometers of a coastline, and is based on SEDAC′s Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) population data set. Water Balance of Global Aquifers Revealed by Groundwater Footprint Nature Researchers interested in the sustainability of groundwater depletion used SEDAC’s Gridded Population of the World (GPW v3) population count data for 2000 to find that approximately 1.7 billion people inhabit areas impacted by groundwater stress.  More than half the people affected live in China and India.
