When the sun comes down and crashes into the earth and the world is destroyed, only two men will survive the catastrophe and that is Sting and the Undertaker brother.

The WWE dropped the ball again for the second pay per screw in a row brother. The Royal Rumble was a fumble man and last Sunday’s Elimination Chamber PPV was a bore with Randy Orton walking out with the gold, cementing the match that nobody wants to see against Batista. Batista couldn’t give his matches away man, but the WWE brings him in because he’s big. He may be big brother, but charisma has passed him by man. Randy Orton isn’t a barnburner either dude and this match is a throw away match. If it’s the main event man, expect people to shut it off before it ends. Who cares man?

Popularity: 1% Read More UFO Investigations Manual by Nigel Watson: Aliens, Sightings, Flying Saucers More February 24th, 2014 Geno By Geno McGahee UFOs and alien visitations make up one of the most popular belief systems in the world today. It is one of the most important questions about the universe and beyond. Are we alone? It doesn’t matter where you stand on this topic or how you view the evidence and theories surrounding it. The fact of the matter is that this is one of the most popular topics of debate and one where nothing can be conclusively proven, but there is a great deal of evidence that when compiled paints quite the picture. In UFO INVESTIGATIONS MANUAL: UFO Investigations from 1892 to the Present Day by Nigel Watson, we have one of the best books concerning the topic to date. It is much like a text book and the approach strays away from the sensational and focuses on what we know. It traces the history of recorded sightings, where to look for UFOs (the hot spots), various theories and alternative explanations and much more. If you are interested in learning about this topic and researching it, this book is a great step forward in your journey.

There is a new Illuminati princess and that is Katy Perry. When she’s not holding Moloch and singing about how she worships him, she is dancing on stage as Baphomet watches on. In her video for Dark Horse, she pushes the all-seeing eye continually. At one point, she covers her eye with an all seeing eye on a stick and then she continues to place one hand over her eye in the video. She is now doing the bidding of the Illuminati and the people are eating it up. Most of the uninformed dismiss the symbolism and just think that it’s art, but there is a method to this madness.

Why would a network do this? The answer is simple. His criticism of Barack Obama, the puppet spokesman of the Illuminati, was his downfall.
