M ore than 30 years after the passage of civil rights legislation, significant economic and social inequalities persist amongst racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Analysis of well-being by race and ethnicity using data from the 1997 National Survey of Americas Families (NSAF) confirms that disparities exist both within and across all racial and ethnic groups. Even at higher incomes, whites and Asians repeatedly fare better than blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. 1 2 However, despite similarities in well-being among blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans and between whites and Asians, the groups also differ significantly across several measures, which suggests that new policy approaches may be needed to reduce inequalities. Poverty 3 Figure 1 shows poor (below 100 percent of the FPL) and low-income (below 200 percent of the FPL) people by race and ethnicity. Across all racial and ethnic groups, 15 percent of the nonelderly are poor. Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, however, each have poverty rates almost twice as high as Asians and almost three times as high as whites. Among low-income persons, inequalities across racial and ethnic groups persist. While 26 percent of whites and 29 percent of Asians are low-income, the rate is 49 percent for blacks, 54 percent for Native Americans, and 61 percent for Hispanics. Hispanics are significantly more likely than blacks to be low-income. Family Structure figure 2 shows, the vast majority of white and Asian children lived with two parents, while slightly more than half of Hispanic children and half of Native American children lived in two-parent families. In contrast, only about one-third of black children lived with two parents, a rate less than half the national average. Asian children were significantly more likely than white children to live in two-parent families. Child Support table 1 ). White children with a nonresident parent were more likely to receive child support (58 percent) than all other groups, including Asian children (43 percent). Black children with a nonresident parent were also significantly more likely to receive child support than their Hispanic counterparts (48 percent versus 40 percent).

Food and Housing Hardship table 2 ). The differences in food hardship across racial and ethnic groups are striking; across all income groups, Hispanic, black, and Native American nonelderly experienced food problems at a rate nearly twice that of white and Asian nonelderly. table 2 ). Across all income levels, the bimodal pattern of well-being by ethnic group was again apparent, since rates of housing hardship for blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans were twice as high as those for Asians and whites. Asians, however, were significantly less likely than whites to report housing hardship. Although it appears that higher-income Native Americans were less likely to report housing hardship than whites, this difference was not statistically significant. Intragroup disparities were pronounced in many racial and ethnic groups, including Asians, whose rates of housing insecurity among low-income families were more than five times higher than among higher-income families.

Health Status and Health Insurance figure 3 shows, Hispanic adults were by far the most likely to be in fair or poor health. Racial and ethnic disparities in health status persisted across both low- and higher-income groups. Low-income Hispanic adults in particular were most likely to report being in fair or poor health (33 percent), and this rate was significantly different from that of any other racial/ethnic group. In comparison, 23 percent of blacks and 20 percent of Native Americans and whites in the low-income bracket reported fair or poor health status. Low-income Asian adults were the least likely to be in fair or poor health (12 percent), a rate significantly lower than that for whites. table 3 . 4 Across all income levels, the vast majority of white and Asian children were privately insured, while less than half of black, Hispanic, and Native American children had private coverage. 5 Among low-income children, 16 percent of black children were uninsured, whereas 19 percent of Asian and white children were (not a significant difference). Comparative-ly, 29 percent of low-income Hispanic children and 48 percent of Native American children were uninsured. Among adults, patterns of disparity across different racial and ethnic groups again emerge. The prevalence of uninsurance is much higher for black, Native American, and Hispanic adults than for whites and Asians. White adults were significantly less likely than Asian adults to be uninsured.
