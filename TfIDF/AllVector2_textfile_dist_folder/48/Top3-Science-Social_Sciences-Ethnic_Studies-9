Congratulations to Professor Adria Imada! Professor Adria L. Imadahas been selected by the Organization of American Historians (OAH) to receive the 2013 Lawrence W. Levine Award , which is given annually for the best book in American cultural history. From the OAH Letter: "According to the 2013 Lawrence W. Levine Award Committee, Aloha America: Hula Circuits through the U.S. Empire (Duke University Press) introduces Imadas fascinating book with a problem: Hawaiian hula dancers were hypervisible in popular culture while leaving only the faintest traces in the archives. Through nuanced readings of diverse bodies of evidenceinterviews and oral history, newspapers and scrapbooks, photographs and U.S. military filmsImada maps the shifting meanings of hula performance from annexation to statehood to contemporary tourism. Centering the labor and mobility of the dancers, Imada locates stories of hula in the Chicago Worlds Columbian Exposition, midcentury nightclubs, and statehood events, as well as in the Pacific theatre where the troupes meet the troops. She argues that the genealogy of hula remained contested, even as increasing distance from its origins confronted dancers with the pressures of commodification and imperial imperatives for an imagined intimacy. Aloha America not only contributes to histories of performance, gender, and empire, but also presents a rich narrative about the ways in which generations of women negotiated the contradictions of heritage." Congratulations to Maile Arvin!
