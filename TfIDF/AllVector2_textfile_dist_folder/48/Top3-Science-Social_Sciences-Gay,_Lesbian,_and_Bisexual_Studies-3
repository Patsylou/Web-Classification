NEW YORK UNIVERSITY ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE Home People Undergraduate Program Events Center for the Gender and Sexuality Studies Department of Social and Cultural Analysis Stay Connected Facebook Twitter The undergraduate Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies is administered through the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and offers a broad interdisciplinary investigation of gender and sexuality as keys to understanding human experience, fully integrating the study of gender and sexuality in its core curriculum, and insistently extending the view beyond U.S. borders. At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of "male" and "female," as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies. Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as "natural" or "normal" in traditional academic curricula.
