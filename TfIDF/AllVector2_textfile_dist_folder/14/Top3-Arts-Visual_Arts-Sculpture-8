Aug. 26, 2010 - Disc Numbers - Taamusi Qumaq? My name is Joel Braun. I'm originally from Yellowknife NT and have lived in St. Cloud Minnesota, USA since 1969. My father, Don Braun was a high arctic bush pilot and chief pilot, northern division for Max Ward, Wardair Canada. During his many trips to the north he picked up several carvings, about 20, of which I have 8, and my two brothers have the others. Anyway, most are unidentified but I do have a polar bear carved from variegated grey stone which does have the carvers syllabic and disc #. As far as I can tell the carvers name was Taamusi Qumaq, the letters are, C L, backwards & a syllabic that means si. The disc number is E91569 . The deal is nobody from the Katilvik website to the people at the Canadian Government have seen this disc number. I've also checked several other websites. I find Taamusi lived from 1914 to 1993 and is talked of as being an encyclopedia-ist rather than a carver. I started out to find an estimated value of my pieces to have them insured but curiosity took over and am now wondering about there origins. Can you point me in a direction that may be helpful? Thank you very much. Joel Braun Aug. 7, 2010 - Thorn wood carving? - I have found a wood carved piece, on the back there is a golden label that says "spirit doctors charm, bear and berry picker mating, Haida Indian tribe Queen Charlotte Islands" And is signed Thorn with the copyright symbol. I am wondering if this is authentic, if these pieces are collectible, and what the significance of the carving would be. Is this a positive charm, and what does is symbolize. Thank you very much I would greatly appreciate any information you may have. Jazmine Aug. 6, 2010 - Inuit Standing Man The carved Inuit figure of a man was purchased in 1968 from Eaton's on St. Catherine's Street, Montreal. At the time, a group of Inuit carvers were working in the store, showing their skills. The receipt has been lost in one of the many moves made over time. I would appreciate knowing who was, or is, the carver. An approximate value would be nice. Condition is very good with one small chip on the rib cage and a natural fault on the forehead. I have lived with this figure for over 40 years and being closer to my death than my birth, I think that he might like to move to another home. Regards, Leask Ward Aug. 5, 2010 - Floral soapstone carving I have what I believe to be a soapstone carving, similar to the two you have photos of on your site with the roses/floral and cups ( photo 1 , photo 2 Todd May 10, 2010 - Here’s what you’ve been waiting for! I am very proud to present to you two (2) Inuit sculptures from my personal collection. These beauties were carved by well-known artist Henry Napartuk In July 1970, Queen Elizabeth II made an official visit to Canada and the Northwest Territories. The organizing committee requested that my collection be on display in the Queen’s private quarters wherever she stayed. I graciously accepted this offer. Other than that short period of time, my carvings always have been in my possession. Transportation issues and the threat of breakage while in transit were highly considered and cared for. by Henry Napartuk by Henry Napartuk For any comments or questions, please send me an e-mail Sincerely, Léo Poirier More images here Apr. 11, 2010 - New Web Address www.douglascreek.net Thank you, Wendy Hook Douglas Creek Sculpture Co.

Jan. 10, 2010 - re: Aardvark - In information I found online in 2005 ( below ), Aardvark was the name of a company that produced cast pieces, not carved soapstone. You should be able to tell whether this is this case with your eagles by comparing them with a piece you know to be soapstone. The look and feel are different. ST .

The original company was called Steatite of Southern Oregon , and they were bought out recently, and the new owners are continuing the business. (The company was started by the late John Pugh, who was in countless publications for his soapstone - asbestos free and rated 1 on the Mohs scale.) The new owners are very nice people and they have quite a bit of rock on hand right now ranging from little 3 lb. pieces to larger pieces (maybe 20lb+). They said they will have more when the snow melts away in the mountains and they can resume mining. The new name is The Southern Oregon Soapstone Company . I obtained their email address: southernoregonsoapstone@mail.com . They said they are in the process of changing phone numbers so I can forward that number to you when I receive the new number.

Soapstone Carving - I recently purchased this soapstone sculpture at an auction - there were some other Alaskan items that were for sale from the same lot so I think it may be an Alaskan piece. Anyhow, it is about a foot tall and a half tall, and very heavy. It is a (probably) mid century modern (?) piece. It is a soapstone sculpture of a man fishing in the water (sea?) depicted at the base, by waves. The man has a long, curved nose, with long, flowing white hair. There are places for implements in both of the man's hands, but the implements are gone. There is no name anywhere of the artist. I've taken a liking to the thing, and wonder if there might be any way to identify the artist or Tribe from where it hails. Thanks, Sue , Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Saxapahaw, NC.

Dayna Buskirk July 2, 2008 - Owl carving - Over 25 yrs. ago friend brought me this owl weighing about 21 lbs and 18" high. No one can tell me the composition, but friend brought it from Greece while he was in service. Though heavy as a rock, it is very smooth and soft to the touch, appears to be polished. The eyes appear to be glass insets over black & yellow painted eyes. Could be wrong. No amount of cleaning, even with chemicals and soap to clean black wrapper marks from it, has damaged it, and there is carved in back, under tail, "DIO GENE" Very hard to see & does not show in photos.

Three (walrus, seal, owl) of them are signed B Talmadge Juneau. The fourth is a seal and has a label on the back which reads "artist Daniel of Port Harrison." The fifth is the largest and has a label on the bottom which says "Eskimo art Canada." With the exception of the first seal they are all black. They have some damage which reveals an inner chalkiness. Soapstone? They range in size from 4 to 9 inches in length and 2-3" in width. The owl stands 4" tall. I am attaching pictures (below). I would appreciate anything you could tell me about these. Thank you, Roberta Shinn . 2/27/05 Help! Charles Dickens Gads Hill - Maybe you can help or direct me!

It is approximately 14 inches in height and weighs at least 16 pounds. It is of an Inuit hunter sitting on a polar bear smoking a pipe. It is black in color and is very cold to the touch. The carving seems rather crude. It is not signed; however there is a small gold label on the bottom which says Al Wolf. I have looked for info on the net about him but can find nothing. Can you help? Thanks Heather MacDonald . 8/3/04 Carving Appraisal - I have a small collection of serpentine stone carvings and a couple pieces made from caribou antler.

I would be interested in there value and market availability. Thank you, Fred 8/1/04. WE Wolf Originals D. MacAskill WE Wolf Originals - The Answer - I somehow managed to stumble on your web site and found several requests for information regarding Wolf Originals (WE) carvings. Even though their subject matter often depicts Inuit life and people, they are not produced by Inuits, not hand carved, and not made of soapstone. They are produced by combining pulverized rock dust with a kind of resin which is poured into a mold. They would qualify as souvenir art - very cute, but not authentic. Aside from the WE stamp, there are other characteristics that differentiate them from real Inuit rock carvings. They have a very different look and feel than rock. They are not as heavy for their size, not as cold to the touch, and they have kind of a waxy feel to them. They are also pretty uniform in color (except for the wash that lightens parts of them) and they lack the imperfections, color variations, and occlusions found in most rock. There were a variety of companies that produced these pieces to sell to tourists -- much to the distress of Inuit artists, because they're often misrepresented as "genuine Inuit art." I'd estimate their value between $5 and $25 -- hope this helps. Judy . 4/8/04 Another WE Wolf Sculptures carving - My name is Mike Gaudet, down in Louisiana, USA. I also obtained a small sculpture with the name Wolf Sculptures written on the bottom and WE carved into the item, a man pulling a seal out the water.

Thanks for any pointers.

My name is Stephen Solmes,and in 1996 a prospector wandered on my 96 acre property. He was looking for soapstone which had been documented as a small outcropping. As luck would have it, almost all of my property is soapstone. I have been selling pieces to sulptors up to a thousand lbs. I have secured the mineral rights,and am now ready after extensive research to open a quarry. This soapstone seems to be very unique. I have grey, grey with blood red veins, green, green with dark green to black, red, red deep red to brown. Also a mottled stone (leopard look). Something really different, the stone is bent and has every colour in the rainbow and has an opal essence to it, that shimmers. I have almost no experience in this industry. I am looking for people experienced in extracting and marketing my stone. A partnership or a joint effort is what seems to be the best thing for me at this time. I hope this interests you. It may be something big for both of us. I look forward to hearing from you. I am located in eastern Ontario Can.

Repair bruised stone? - Do you know of any way to "repair" bruised stone that is, make the bruise invisible?

After it's done you'll probably have to smooth the seam and polish it again... ST . 10/9/2005 What kind of glue? - How do you repair a piece of soapstone - what type of glue would you recommend?
