 Pukulan Cimande Pusaka San Michele Italian System An Maide Mear Eire-Irish Stick Home Marketplace Seminars Distance Programs willsanders@earthlink.net Student Video Clip My student Peterson, showing his trumbu skills with the halu stick. We sell the videos so you can learn from them just as he did, in the long distance program. New Service I want to announce I am offering a new service. This is for a private in depth evaluation of ANY PCP subject in the physical aspects YOU choose. When I make a little comment on a face book video, like add a kick etc , its VERY superficial. I could comment on MANY more things. So, IF you are a registered student of mine and want an in depth review and correct on foot work, snake, knife disarms etc, pick ONE subject, make me a video no more than 45 minutes long. Send me $50 for the evaluation and I will dissect it all for you point by point. ONE topic per video, it can be one animal, or Sera Depok, Tonjok Berang etc etc. This will GREATLY benefit ALL serious students and YOU get to pick the topic. Just send the fee to cimande@cimande.com with paypal and send me a link to the private youtube video and let the classes begin. So NOW no excuses there is no seminar, you have no time to come see me. if your serious about PCP let us get to improving you !!! I am also offering this service for SAN MICHELE AND THE IRISH STICK . SAME RULES SAME PRICE. One topic,as in The Circle of the Sun in San Michele, Basic strikes in the Irish Stick, or foot work.
