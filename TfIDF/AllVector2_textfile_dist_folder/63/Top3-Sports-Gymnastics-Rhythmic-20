 Monarchs Inspiring dynamic kids to grow... About Monarchs. Agoura Hills / Gymnastics Center Agoura Hills / Parkour Newbury Park / Gymnastics Center Coming Soon Originally founded In 1977 by a group of committed and devoted parents, Monarchs has long since been a community leader in children's physical fitness instruction. By 1997 Monarchs was acquired by Yelena Urusova and Vitaly Urusov, when it was a single location in Agoura Hills, CA. An expansion in 2003 to a second location in Newbury Park established itself as a mainstay of the Conejo Valley. Further growth lead to MonarX Parkour Complex and Monarchs Mobile Gymnastics, opening in 2012. Today Monarchs is dedicated to inspiring children to learn, grow and succeed while having fun, whether at gymnastics, tumbling, cheer, camp or at a birthday party! Our goals are deeply rooted in continuously striving to do better for the benefit of our customers. The Mission at Monarchs has always been to cultivate a foundation of physical activity for future generations through body awareness and proper technique while developing a love for fitness and community from childhood.
