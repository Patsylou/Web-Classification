The Filipino arts place great emphasis on footwork, mobility, and body positioning. These arts include Escrima, Dumog, Balintawak, Arnis, Kali, Doce Pares, and many more. Culturally related topics also are welcome such as language, foods and customs.

Datu Tim Hartman 02-16-2014, 10:28 PM Balintawak The Great Grandmaster Anciong Bacon is widely acknowledged as the original master of Balintawak Arnis/Eskrima. In Balintawak Arnis, the stick is used as the primary training tool. The theory is that the stick is only an extension of the arm and that the human body can only move in so many normal ways. In Balintawak, the student is taught that there is a counter to every counter and that continuous research and discovery is the basis of knowledge.
