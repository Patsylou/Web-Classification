Level of surface finish achieved: 25-0.025 micro meters Advantages: -      Variety of materials can be chosen for turning -      Lead  time is shorter View full post Pipe Sizing Calculation Part 6: Determining Reynolds Number In this part we will calculate Reynolds number for the pipe sizing calculation example. Refer Part-1 for understanding the problem statement and the solution steps. From the concept of Reynolds number, it can be written that Reynolds number (Re) = ρ*s*L/μ ………………………eq.1 Where, ρ – Density of the fluid s – Velocity of the fluid View full post Friction Welding Process Friction welding does not require the work pieces to melt locally. Here, the work pieces to be joined are moved (normally rotated) against each others to generate frictional heat and at the same time the forces are applied on the work pieces to press them against each other. Once the initial join starts the relative View full post Torque or Horsepower – Relation Conversion Applications The term torque is, i feel, somewhat neglected between the two engineering terms horsepower and torque. While talking about a electric motor or an IC engine or a gear box, people talks more about the output power than torque probably because the term power comes closer to energy. Though, the following formula can View full post Sheet Metal Forming Process Sheet metal forming is the manufacturing process of creating the sheet metal components only by deforming the sheet metal and not by breaking, cutting, tearing or removing any part of the sheet. Bending, spinning, deep drawing, spinning and stretching are few important sheet metal forming processes. The sheet metal press and like die and punch View full post Turning process Pipe Sizing Calculation Part 6: Determining Reynolds Number Friction Welding Process Torque or Horsepower – Relation Conversion Applications Sheet Metal Forming Process Developing system equations is the important first step for finding solution of a physical mechanical system. Here, I will discuss the procedure for creating the system equations to model a Single Input Single Output (SISO) mechanical system. Example: Find out the displacement [x (t)] with respect to time for the mass m for Continue reading What does a brake booster do?         When you press the brake pedal of your car, as you press it more, you apply more pressure through your leg, and more amount of braking applied to your car.     Brake vacuum servo booster helps increasing the braking of the car without increasing the pedal effort. Continue reading Imagine you are driving, you suddenly see a obstacle in the middle of the road. Now, before you actually press the brake pedal, you, as a human being, will take some time for thinking or analyzing the situation. This time is called thinking time and the distance covered during this time is called thinking distance. Continue reading Tractive force or tractive effort or traction is the force applied between the tire and road surface to move a car or any vehicle for that matter. The maximum permissible traction force that can be applied to the wheels is governed by two things: the weight of the vehicle and the adhesion coefficient between the Continue reading Wheel rolling radius or static loaded radius is taken as input for tire rolling circumference calculation. The rolling circumference (RC), in turns, is further considered as input in various vehicle dynamics calculation like traction force calculation and grade ability calculation. The formula used here is quite simple, RC = 2 x ∏ x SLR.eq.1 Where, SLR Continue reading Older posts Our Services Advertise with Us Get Engineering Assignment Help Subscribe To get the latest post directly to your email box, Enter your email address: Recent Posts Applied Mathematical Modeling of SISO Physical Mechanical System – Part1 –Developing System Equations Working of Power Brake Vacuum Booster Simplified Vehicle Stopping Distance Calculation Equations and Example Tractive Force Calculation for a Vehicle Tire Rolling Circumference Calculation Example Copyright Return to top WordPress and the Graphene Theme .
