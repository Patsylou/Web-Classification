This paper examines these issues in detail and considers both in situ calibration and calibration performed outside the use environment. Application Note Setting and Adjusting Instrument Calibration Intervals - Application Note This document explains how Agilent determines the recommended calibration interval, and why and how this can be extended or reduced. Application Note Paperless Calibration - White Paper Discusses the benefits of storing calibration records electronically rather than on paper in filing cabinets and explains why having a hard copy of these files is not necessary. Application Note Language of Specifications - White Paper This paper explains some of the arcane language used in describing a product's characteristics. Application Note Specifications Guidelines - White Paper Agilent Technologies has definitions for its Test Measurement product specifications and how they are presented. The following material is extracted from these manufacturing recommendations. Application Note Crystal Oscillator Testing - White Paper A policy concerning the testing of the reference oscillators contained within many instruments has been defined and adopted in Agilent's service centers worldwide. Application Note Calibration of Time Base Oscillators - White Paper As more accurate clocks were produced, new uses of time measurement were explored. As new uses were discovered, the need for even more accurate clocks became apparent. Application Note Selecting a Calibration Vendor - White Paper Cost is important but are there any other questions that need to be asked in selecting a calibration supplier? Application Note Using a Manufacturer's Specification as a Type B Error Contribution - White Paper Examines the implications of using a manufacturer's specification in an uncertainty analysis; and how calibration laboratories use uncertainty data in their quality systems and customer-facing documents. Application Note Spectrum Analyzer CW Power Measurements and the Effects of Noise - Article This paper examines how to configure a spectrum analyzer to measure a low-power continuous wave (CW) signal so that the trade-off between measurement time and accuracy is optimized. Article Defining Your Calibration Requirement - White Paper These are the steps that can be taken when actually placing an order to ensure you get a "proper" calibration. Article Instrument Design Validation and Recommended Calibration Policy - White Paper Provides background information on the test philosophies and methods used when developing instrument verification and adjustment procedures. Application Note Connector Pin Recession and its Effect on Network Analyzer Accuracy - White Paper Outlines an experiment undertaken to assess the impact on the measurement of reflection coefficient when using 3.5 mm connectors. Application Note The Six Axes Of Calibration - White Paper To help demonstrate the variances in the deliverables and value of calibration due to lack of regulation. They have been split into 6 axes. This document discusses each of these axes. Application Note The Metrological Financial Implications of a Clogged Fan Filter - White Paper This article discussed the implications of having a clogged air filter and addresses solutions to helping in the prevention of clogged air filters. Application Note Too Much Calibration? - White Paper This paper explains the variables at work in the world of calibration - how they can be used to find the elusive balance point between cost and confidence, or "too much" and "not enough" calibration. Application Note Calibration of Precision Step Attenuators - White Paper Automated parallel IF substitution system for precision attenuator calibration which has been in use for over 15 years and presents results of tests made on some very accurate attenuators. Application Note Photonics Connector Care: Effects of Damage Connectors and Interfaces in Fiber Optic Measurements To qualify or predict the effects of damaged fiber optic connectors or optical interfaces, a qualitative assessment can ensure that these connectors are kept in a condition of optimum performance. Application Note Fully-Automatic DMM Calibration System - White Paper Describes a fully-automatic calibration system for digtial multimeters (DMMs), including the uncertainty estimation of DC Voltage measurements. Application Note Sensitivity Analysis of One-port Characterized Devices in Vector Network Analyzer Calibrations Results of a study on the use of characterized devices in microwave vector network analyzer (VNA) calibrations and measurements. A review of the theory of one-port characterized device calibration. Application Note Understanding Measurement Risk - White Paper An intuitive explanation of probability density functions drawing on Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the relationship between a device's true values and corresponding measured value. Application Note A Guard-Band Strategy for Managing False-Accept Risk - White Paper Presents guard-band strategy for managing false-accept risk with only limited knowledge of the a priori probability that a device is in tolerance. Application Note Attenuation Measurement of Step Attenuators Describes the T-matrix measurement method for achieving high accuracy in calibrating step attenuators. Application Note Evaluation of the Performance of a State-of-the-Art Digital Multimeter - White Paper Describes several methods used to verify the performance of a very accurate automatically calibrated DMM, the HP 3458A. Application Note An Internet-Enabled Primary Impedance Measurement System - White Paper iPIMMS allows microwave network analyser users to achieve uncertainties which are equivalent to those of measurementsperformed at the National Physical Laboratory (NPI).
