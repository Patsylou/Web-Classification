It is intended to be a two-day course for individuals who have experience in one of the supported scripting languages (perl, python, ruby, and tcl). No prior OpenAccess (OA) experience is required as the lecture/labs build up slowly over OA concepts; however, some basic design knowledge is required. A heavy emphasis is placed on the labs. The lecture portion of each section is typically short (10-15 minutes), to allow for more time to be spent on the labs. The primary focus of the material is on layout designs, although many concepts also apply to schematics/symbols. This package is available to all Si2 members.
