Practitioners of ninjutsu have been seen as assassins for hire, and have been associated in the public imagination with other activities which are considered criminal by modern standards. Even though it was influenced by Chinese spying techniques and the strategic principles of Sun Tzu, ninjutsu is believed by its adherents to be of Japanese origin. Ninja is the onyomi reading of the two kanji å¿è€… used to write shinobi-no-mono (å¿ã®è€…), which is the native Japanese word for people who practice ninjutsu (å¿è¡“, sometimes erroneously transliterated as ninjitsu). The term shinobi (historically sino2bi2 written with the Manyogana å¿—èƒ½å‚™), has been traced as far back as the late 8th century when Heguri Uji no Iratsume wrote a poem to Otomo no Yakamochi. The underlying connotation of shinobi (å¿), in Sino-Japanese means to steal away andâ€”by extensionâ€”to forbear, hence its association with stealth and invisibility. Mono (è€…, likewise pronounced sha or ja) means The word ninja became popular in the post-World War II culture. The nin of ninjutsu is the same as that in ninja, whereas jutsu (è¡“) means skill or art, so ninjutsu means the skill of going unperceived or the art of stealth hence, ninja and shinobi-no-mono (as well as shinobi) may be translated as one skilled in the art of stealth. Similarly, the pre-war word ninjutsu-zukai means one who uses the art of remaining unperceived., Other terms which may be used include oniwaban (ãŠåº­ç•ª one in the garden), suppa, rappa, mitsumono, kusa (è‰ grass) and Iga-mono (one from Iga). In English language, the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja, reflecting the Japanese languages lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural ninjas. One version is that the basis of ninjutsu was taught to a Japanese household who fled to the mountains after losing a battle. There they mixed with a varied lot of people including the descendants of refugees who had fled China. Later, the skills were developed over 300 years to create ninjutsu. At the moment there is a lot of different types of ninjutsu like: Genbukan,Bujinkan,Dux ryu and many more but the Iga ryu and Koga ryu ninjutsu are the oldest and the best established ones. Like we know Ninjas had special skills but they were not sorcerer. They were specialized in stealth and disguise with some amazing skills in differents types of weapons like: Ninja-To, shurikens, spear, archery, chain techniques and more, They were also trained in different difficult environment like: Underwater situation, climbing walls, acrobatics skills and of a lot more. The famous story of the ninjas start a long time ago mostly between the years 600 and 1320. Ninja also called Shinobi is a master of stealth and disguise. Shinobi means an expert in the field of information gathering (agent of stealth). Actually the name Ninja came from China. During the war in China (722 to 481 B.C) Ninja were called Kan and a lot of other special agents were created. Saisaku,Yutei and Kansai are some of them. After the big war in China. Ikai the warlord of Shiko was defeated but he escaped to Japan and he established himself in the Iga region where he lived in a cave teaching some peoples the art of Ninjutsu. The mix of Chinese martial arts and japanese martial arts lead to the development of Ninjutsu. The Iga Ryu ninjutsu was created. In 939, Mochizuki Saburo Kaneie (3rd son of the governor of Shinano) He was made ruler of Shiga.Than he changed his name to Koga Omi No Kami Kaneie. His Son Omi No Kami Iechika who was trained into the art of ninjutsu by Tatsumaki Hossi created the Koga ninja clan. Ninjutsu was developed as a collection of fundamental survivalist techniques in the warring state of feudal Japan. The ninja clans used their art to ensure their survival in a time of violent political turmoil. It also included methods of gathering information, non-detection, avoidance, and misdirection techniques. Ninjutsu can also involve training in disguise, escape, concealment, archery, medicine, explosives, and poisons. Although the popular view is that ninjutsu is the art of secrecy or stealth, actual practitioners consider it to mean the art of enduring enduring all of lifes hardships. The word nin carries both these meanings. To avoid misunderstandings, should just refer to a specific branch of Japanese martial arts, unless it is being used in a historical sense.
