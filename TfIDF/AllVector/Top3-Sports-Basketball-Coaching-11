BRETT LEDBETTER TALKS ON "BUILDING YOUR INNER COACH." IT IS A GREAT VIDEO AND I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. From Coach Ron Link, Athens Christian School, Athens, GA: I have been a head basketball coach for 43 years and I am about to start my 44th year. Several years ago I sent out a request to coaches and officials all over America asking for great stories that have happened to them during their careers. I have many of my own but I thought it would be great to share stories from coaches and officials from all parts of the United States. I received several great stories from coaches and officials... but not near enough to complete the book. I have authored 4 other books but this one could be the best by far--if we could just get the stories sent to me. It doesn't matter how long you have been coaching or officiating--some of my best stories occurred when I was a "rookie" coach. I have listed the chapters below in no certain order -- so if you have any story -- sad, funny, amazing or whatever -- send it to me at this email address . You may add a new chapter if it does't fit any listed: - Communication is a Lost Art - "Fan-tastic" or not so "Fan-tastic" Fans - The Good -- The Bad -- And The Ugly - Believe it or Not... - Never Ever Give Up! - Technical Difficulties - Mission Impossible - The Twilight Zone - Have a Seat Coach! - Embarrassing Moments - Building the Future - The Final Whistle - Other (Name a Chapter) NEW NCAA RULES:  There are some major changes in the NCAA Eligibility Requirements for DI and DII. These changes will begin August 1, 2016. High school coaches need to be aware of these changes, especially if you anticipate developing some DI or DII student/athletes in the coming years. Here is a powerpoint presentation  NCAAEligibilityRulesRegulations.pptx  designed to educate high school teachers and coaches about these requirements. Tom Hursey, Executive Director
