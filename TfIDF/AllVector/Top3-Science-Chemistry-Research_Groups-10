 Aloha! Welcome to the X-ray Diffraction Research Group website. We are currently the only chemistry research group at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and one of the few X-ray groups at an undergraduate institution in the world. Our current research interests include the synthesis and structural characterization of cobalt and iron dioxygen complexes which imitate the active site of hemoglobin and myoglobin, and the X-ray structural characterization of various copper(II) Jahn-Teller complexes. Dr. Charles J. Simmons heads a group of undergraduate students at the University of Hawaii at Hilo in cooperation with the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS/NIH) program at UHH. Our Bruker-Nonius Kappa CCD X-ray Diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryostream/700 Liquid Nitrogen Cryostat.
