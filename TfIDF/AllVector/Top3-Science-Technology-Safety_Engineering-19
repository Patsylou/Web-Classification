JOBS POSTING Senior Research Scientist, Research Scientist, and Post-Doctoral Fellow positions in the National Crash Analysis Center . RECENT HIGHLIGHTS 2012 Toyota Camry model posted (2014-Feb-11) Occupant models posted (2014-Jan-14) NCAC research efforts related to the effective deployment of cable median barriers under National Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 2225 culminated in the publication of NCHRP Report 711: Guidance for the Selection, Use, and Maintenance of Cable Barrier Systems . This report research documents efforts to develop guidance for highway designers relative to effective installation for a wide range of roadside situations. The NCAC was awarded this contract after several years of research for the FHWA that included the first simulation analyses of cable barriers and fullscale crash tests of cable barriers in medians. The guidance is expected to be used across the U.S. (122012) On a Roll NCAC research on frontal crash and rollover featured in Crash Test Technology International , September 2012.
