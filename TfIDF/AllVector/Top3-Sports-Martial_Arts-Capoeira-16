Since training capoeira with ACSF my confidence has gone up. Learning capoeira forced me to break out of my nervous barrier, and push myself past self-perceived limits Jorge Aguirre STUDENT since he was 8 years old ABADÁ-Capoeira SF performed during our pre-game entertainment for The Oakland Raiders at the Hispanic Heritage game. We were very impressed with their performance. Through the use of live music our fans were able to experience a true performance of Brazilian Martial Arts. Olivia Haro Oakland Raiders Marketing Intern Coordinator ABADÁ-Capoeira performed in our office during our annual Diversity Week celebrations. We were so inspired by the dancers that we hope to offer ABADÁ-Capoeira classes in our office in the future. Gerilyn Ward Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP I have been attending BodyBrasil for several years and I’ve never had a better workout. The class is always different and the music is always good.
