Older news, but thenatus pointed out the update. From the Project 64 blog: Make sure current dir is base folder (not screenshot) Initialize eeprom to 0xFF instead of 0x00 Add LL and SC to Analyze Instruction ignore 0x0407000D as an opcode in analysis Make it easier for plugins to read directories from the emu fix per game rsp plugin updated rdb file Glide64: Added version to the installer Get Settings to go through the emulator Get Glide64, GlideHQ, Glitch64 to be a single dll Read texture directory from emulator Fix up getting functions from texture lib Input Plugin: Update to 1.7.0.12 provided by squall MADrigal's Simulators have a few updates - Pac Man (Tomy) and Donkey Kong (Coleco - tabletop) Stella release 3.9.2 for Linux, MacOS X and Windows is now available. Improved parsing of the DASM lst file for the debugger disassembly; it sometimes missed constant declarations. Changed 'usemouse' argument from a true/false option to accept 'always', 'analog' and 'never'. This allows to use the mouse as a controller under more specific circumstances. The default is 'analog', which means the mouse is only used to emulate analog-like devices (paddles, trackball, etc). Added ability to use bold fonts within the debugger window, which can be set with the 'dbg.fontstyle' commandline argument as well as in the debugger UI Settings dialog. This is useful for those that find the current font too narrow. Renamed 'debuggerres' argument to 'dbg.res'. All future debugger- specific options will start with 'dbg.'. The TIA 'zoom' area in the debugger now supports scrolling the mouse wheel (currently up/down only, as I don't have a sideways scrolling mouse to test with). -Have fun!
