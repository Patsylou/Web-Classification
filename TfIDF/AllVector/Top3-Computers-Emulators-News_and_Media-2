Raine is also available for Linux .  It started as an experiment with the Rainbow Islands romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate many nice games now, including new additions from Cave and other companies. Sound was improved thanks to the work of Hiromitsu Shioya. More recently, several new programmers have joined Raine Team, adding drivers making improvements. Emulating cpus and sound chips takes quite a lot of coding time, so, like most of the current emulators, Raine uses emulation engines already available when possible. Download Raine at our Arcade game emulation page .

For indexing and simplicity sake, I will call it a Windows emulator anyway, heh. Wine 1.1.33 is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X, OpenGL, and Unix. Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100% non-Microsoft code, however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes, including Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris. Wine 1.1.33 has the following changes: Read the rest of this entry No Comments 1a , Emulator News , Windows emulators Posted November 8, 2009 at 11:55 pm Dolphin SVN r4524 is a Wii and Gamecube emulator for Windows.

No Comments 1a , Emulator News , MESS and Multi System emulation Posted at 11:47 pm MESS .135 is to computers and consoles as MAME is to arcade machines. i.e. It is an attempt to exactly emulate early computer and console systems. It is based primarily on the MAME source code so versions run in parallel to MAME. The reason MESS can use MAME as a basis is that most chips in computers and consoles are direct copies of arcade chips just connected a different way. In the guide you need to be aware of some terminology. If I use the word system it means the computer or console system being emulated. If I use the word BIOS it is meant to be for system roms or BIOS images used to get MESS working. Finally if I use the word software it means the rom/tape/disk etc… image to be loaded onto the system running in MESS.
