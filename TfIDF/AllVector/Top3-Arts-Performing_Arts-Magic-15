I taught myself many magic tricks from books and some of my own making. I claim Cards as my specialty, but I am also fairly good with coins. I do a lot of sleight of hand, but can always get better. I'm hoping that through this website, we can all learn from each other and all become much better magicians. If you wish to contact me, I can be reached via my profile.
