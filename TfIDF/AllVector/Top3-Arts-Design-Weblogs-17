(Vatican City also disallows divorce.) This is, of course, enormously detrimental to countless Filipino women and children who are trapped in abusive marriages or who have been abandoned by a heartless husband/father. There is currently a bill in the Philippine Congress to address this injustice , but it faces fierce and concerted opposition. Im working on a logo for a group that supports this bill: The sun and star elements are from the Filipino flag, as are the colors. The sun, being cut off on the bottom, represents rising hope for families suffering under the archaic law that imprisons them. This is a work in progress. { Comments on this entry are closed } Goodbye to a Dear, Dear Friend by Patrick on 06/11/2011 With heavy heart I must report that exactly one month ago God saw fit to take my dear friend, Maggie (also know as ) away from me. She finally succumbed to cancer on May 14 at 7:04 PM. She was twelve years old (84 in our years). The photo above was taken as I spent my last moments with her before she was euthanized. The tumor in her abdomen had almost burst through the skin, and she was suffering terribly, unable to eat, drink, or walk. She went on her last hike in the woods she loved so much just two days before she died. I cannot properly express how painful her loss is and how dearly I miss her. The emptiness she left behind is vast and profound. I pray that our animals do have an immortal soul, that she is now happy and free from pain, and that we will meet again. She was such a good dog, and such a huge part of me. { Comments on this entry are closed } Work of Heart by Patrick on 07/13/2010 For my wonderful girls birthday. { Comments on this entry are closed } It was all in fun, I didnt hurt no one 04.11.2010 Saw Drive-By Truckers in Boston last week.
