 Enter your search terms Submit search form I have therefore made a test version of the program available for download. You can download it here (7543 KB). The program uses a JIT compiler to convert Arm machine code to x86 code so will only work on Intel Mac's at the moment. However, there is also code in RPCEmu to interpret the Arm processor so once this is working, the program will work on Power PC's as well (although slower). I have now got the PPC code working and you can download it here (7476 KB). As expected, it does run rather slowly. I haven't included any OS ROM images so you will have to provide your own. If you don't have a three button mouse, the middle mouse menu button is on Alt-Command (or F14). Ctrl-Alt-Command brings up a GUI menu to configure the program (or Ctrl-F14). There is limited sound support at the moment. Everything else I have tested seems to be working OK. on your system , can you please send me get in touch .
