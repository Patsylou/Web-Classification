The main purpose of Alpha is to facilitate the interchange of ideas and information between scientists, technologists, and technicians. The Alpha Board has decided that the topic for the third global Alpha Consensus meeting will be on establishing the minimum expectations for the professional status of the clinical embryologist. In doing this Alpha is not trying to dictate to regulators, but is certainly seeking to educate them in what makes clinical embryology a special and unique profession and how we must protect the interests of infertile patients around the world and strive towards ensuring they have equitable access to the best possible care and treatment. The Alpha Consensus Meeting on the Professional Status of Clinical Embryologists will be held in May, 2014.
