Savillo  ------------------------------------------------------ ... The rhythm of flooding defines the river ecosystem. Science now recognizes  these extreme events as beneficial natural disturbances, essential to maintaining a mosaic of dynamic, heterogeneous habitat types that support many species having different  environmental requirements and thereby sustaining the high biological productivity and ecological integrity of rivers ......................   In short, from an ecological perspective floods are not disasters in a sense that human society typically views them. Through destruction, floods rejuvenate river ecosystem by maintaining dynamic ecological structure and function. Therefore when flood regimes are altered, natural river functioning may become impaired. by N.

That's why a published 2003 paper was erroneous as what the author said and in 2012 sent this information to the journal  where it was published in 2003 with an apology. [Why is it that the extraction for that journal article was done in 2012 that's about nine years after publication? ] An international organization relevant to thinking and behavior was recently asked by someone in the forum if how they judge sexual phenotypes- his response- "only if the patient tells so." Therefore, my quote- in my article 2010 Impermanence of Sexual Phenotypes ( BB )(Thomson Reuters) is very much the gauging point of Sexual Phenotype Identification.  *This is an exciting 2012 paper very supportive of my 2010 article that gender identity is self- identified.

From:  ISMCBBPR ____________________________________________________       Note: Other Pioneering findings are up there Theoretical Findings #1- One of my (Isidro T. Savillo) pioneering theoretical discoveries is the  "Impermanence of  Sexual Phenotypes for both Plants and Animals."  This finding has been published (2010)  and was supported by my previous publication (on animals-2003)  where I made a pioneering  statement (2003) ahead of others (2009). Having this in mind, I also  made a statement on  the impermanence of sexual phenotypes on plants. New surprising result (not included in  my publication)  such as the capability of  sexual phenotype change in  Nephelium   lappaceum   would indicate the big possibility that sexual phenotype change can occur in other  plants  given the proper conditions- genetic, environmental,etc. According to a multi- awarded  world famous  CALTECH*  professor and scientist, this [work of mine] speaks for itself and would  need no further [elaboration][from him].10/2012.  My sincere thanks. *Congratulations to CALTECH as the best research university in the world 2012-2013!

If Genes could or would not change and be expressed  with various factors around it (biotic and abiotic) as an epigene , then the epigene could definitely  change by itself too- not necessarily dependent on the gene and its internal environment but also  being influenced by the external environment. Therefore to be able to survive successfully there  is the polishing of the epigenes  for the most capable of existence. Can Natural Selection be an  epigenetic factor? But to be fair epigene could not be without the DNA or the gene... therefore it  is time to unite the two theories.   10/27/2013``Epigenes: How fast (by seconds, years etc.) are the phenotypes (cellular to organismal/cellular) produced/realized by an epigene after the epigenetic interactions with the gene in question took place?  Theoretical Finding # 3- Redefinition of Modified Leaves ( online) At UCLA Conference Center              A colleague [from Czech] in BGBM- FU Berlin                 At the background is the City of SFO  At  Lake Arrowhead, CA, USA           gave me this photo- September in Berlin-                     California, USA (smiling with shades)  Taken by my american colleague  whose  group was nominated for a Nobel Prize.   _______________________________________ 10/27/2012- I have tried to find solutions of having a standard  for raising children (where it will lead to an all through out satisfaction per se)  but it is as difficult as anyone  could think about. Probably, this is just  clashes of the minds- where both minds don't meet at levels of needs. I can call these as the philosophical interventions but whether this may  have a genetic bearing, I still would espouse the environment - the proper one as superior  over the genes and a much better way of exacting standard for raising your specific kids.  As a Theoretical Biologist in the Theoretical Biology Directory ~ (2008) "Epigenetics and Savillo's theory on the influence of exogenous and endogenous environments  (2002-2003) to gene expressions are not far apart" a remembrance I bought right                          on the spot.

Is this due to genetics or epigenetics?   12/06/08~ Just like any type of human behavior, the expectations of sexual behavioral  phenotype can be twisted by the environment and are not wholly genetically based. e lived the Longest by Dan Buettner (Wikipedia states that it is directly hard wired from the brain. Seem autonomic- like).  And it's good to come back to it. Anything that an organism do is environmentally  influenced like in animal courtship, in breathing, in standing up for the ist time as  observed in complex lower form of animals, etc. It's a cascade mechanism of signals  initiated by birth- just like the bloating of the lungs once the fetus is out of her mom's  placenta that will initiate lung- breathing reflexes. The biophysical influence of the  environment here is working. So much more in lower forms of animals way of standing up ....the muti- interactions of organ systems such as the circulatory system, the extension  mechanisms of the limbs and the bodies ripe need* for oxygen will drive the animal to stand... and the smell of milk will lead to his sucking needs or her mom's intimate* "signals".  Environmental influence can either be intrinsic (within the organism) or extrinsic  (outside of the organism) but the best answer is both. Well human babies are the  lowest graded when it comes to environmentally influenced reactions independent  of parents compared to complex lower forms of animals. Human babies are slaves  to philosophies of their caretakers until they grow to be what they are as influenced  in toto (by the enviroment and their genes).  They just can't do things on their own.  Not only they inherit the culture of their caretakers but also their caretakers'  economic status because of too much dependence since birth. to get up for air; a mother hen could no longer recognize the chick that she hatched  so she pecked on the poor being.. so the chick will make the human caretaker as imprint "mom" whenever the caretaker feed the chick or wherever the caretaker goes the chick follows. (up to graduate programs) with that of the growth and development of the human  being. Or is it too long? leading to excessive dependency and exorbitant expenses? and are in present form complicated but not as stimulating and simply presented  like the pheromones. We need for more specific findings on the Genes for Visual  Likeness and Dislikeness(e.g. behavior in sexual phenotypes) to know why organisms  including humans visually behave that way. specifically on a moderate level in order to attain genuine satisfaction and real happiness.  Too little or too much of anything is unhealthy biologically. ~I. Savillo 05/2008 elaborations  as part of their family counseling and guidance especially with their  young children.  Commonly, in some parts of tropical Asia, it is known that the  "undesirable genes"  (pls. see below regarding definition) start to appear more or less during the age of  45 thus the monies earned will mostly go to the buying of  maintenance medicines  as well as physician consultations, hospitalizations etc.  It is a must that the young  children and couples would start physiological and  economic aggressiveness as  early as possible so as to realize wholesome satisfaction  and benefits, respectively  of their lives prior to the onset of their genetic diseases. ~I. A. Savillo 8/06/2007 it becomes a part of an ancestral lineage while being spooled into as environmental  memory. Don't underestimate the role of environment in genetic influence. This is another clear proof. ~I. Savillo,7/26/2006  fits the genotypic "lock". Otherwise there will be no such thing as evolution. Moreover  there are some genetic mechanisms which follow the Mendelian Laws but where are  the genes?Isidro Savillo* 3/22/2006 (modified 9/09/2007) As  observed in various levels of organisms, gametes are also shed or released in  unconscious situations but may have the goal towards successful fertilization. Irregardless of what type of reproductive processes, evolution has patterned  life to continue urgently the perpetuation of the species. Isidro Savillo* 3/12/2006 THE THINKER* statement of mine. (11/20/2004) particular situations and are visually comprehensible in higher organisms  [in progress]11/2004. structural, behavioral and physiological phenotypes are exhaustively described.  This represents an overview or outline of the three ways of phenotypic  production in the individual organism. which of them, has a substantial role as universal gene effector. Gene effectors  could either be activators or depressors of behavior. As a universal gene effector, it may have a great effect to the overall composition of the individual organism  and may bring drastic results. served by physiological hints and signals earlier in life which most have dissuaded  or ignored. But these are the basis of future bodily catastrophes. To own  a genomic profile with a layman's explanation may help protect the individual  with proper physiological and environmental treatments thus lessen suffering  and may extend survivality." by Isidro T. Savillo, 8/28/2005 cellular bearings or support are never scientific. They are just guesses or  hypotheses, products of sensual observations and surveys, dependent on the  ficklemindedness of the respondents and shamefully, such researches are considered for the highest achievement. They are phenotypes, phenotypes, phenotypes.... without the genes, cells and molecules with their respective environmental interactions, importantly, responsible for the production of such phenotypes. 5/2007  ~I. Savillo beginning to take root with the continuous process in the meticulous analyses of genomic profiles of the human individuals. A certain individual has "billions  of bad genes" and these are continuously growing. Their expressions may be direct, environmentally induced, semi- lethal, or whatever  (as long as they are expressed), niched in various biochemical pathways  or solitary. So, too the good genes and these are also continuously growing. Another individual has "billions and a one bad genes" and these are  continuously growing so too with his good genes. At the onset of late adulthood,  there will be "trillions of bad genes" and less good genes eventually leading to mortality. At a certain point in time in a specific dimension, there is an equality of the expressions of these bad and good genes but the process  of adding and subtracting would make ones list longer than the other and later a vice versa but as this is of similar ruling to all humans, then there is still a basis for equality. With the continuous growth of molecular and cell biology, no bad or good gene be missed for correction or improvement.  Appropriate environmental and physiological treatments are beginning to  be felt with the advent of personalized medicine. THEN, why discriminate  oneself? Why loose confidence? When every human is a bunch of more  bad than  good genes (that's why it leads to death). An astute geneticist  can identify  dozens of bad genes by just one look at the individual. A  genomic  profile  will give one a reason to make as many personal insults  to anyone  including  his next generations. Then, why are these people  behaving as  if they are superior than the others. I find it useless and  meaningless.  *Prof. Isidro T. Savillo  Posted at the Scientists Solution Forum genome project - not the completion of the human genome project or the human genome project per se where nothing has been done after that. on the Impermanence of Sexual Phenotypes that includes behavior , this has nothing to do with the legalization of same sex marriages that are presently sprouting or I  condone them or other derivative explanations. But I think what the lawyers are  proposing is something to what they have observed or probably have studied  extensively.  As an example, human sexual reproduction among siblings will create  a very  big possibility of abnormalities in progenies. Because this has happened and  were observed to happen , then a derivative law about it was established  (Is there such a thing?).``Prof. Savillo's other article that could shed to the  impermanence of sexual phenotypes is located here .~~ 01/03/2010~~ SAVILLO's Statement on  "THE IMPERMANENCE OF SEXUAL PHENOTYPES"  is done (Jan. 10, 2010).

A parallel situation towards the "hermaphroditic" aspect is observed in some humans: a change in sexual phenotypes towards  adulthood, unexpected because of the "normalcy" shown during the toddler  stage or previous to that. In certain circumstances, changes in sexual phenotypes  may occur since birth or even earlier. Will the fruitless gene leads the answer?" by Isidro A. T. Savillo, 8/29/2005 repetitive cutting of a male Carica papaya will convert the plant into  a female. Pulpits can change sexual phenotypes depending on the stored substrates of the previous season as well as that of the cucurbits.  The latter would do so depending on the application of a suitable plant  growth regulator (Metcalf, T. 2005 , Personal Communcation). Particular  literatures on Silene noctiflora, Ceratopteris, Buchloe dactyloides and  Actinidia deliciosa have shown sexual phenotype changes to a particular extent (Meyerowitz, E. 2005 Personal Communication). ~Isidro A. T. Savillo 8/29/2005 Nov. 01. 2012``Plants are such beholders (victims not a very good word for it  may be for their benefit)  of sex change naturally or anthropogenically just like  in animals like fishes.  As I go through  my readings, a plant can change sex naturally  once it reached a particular age.T here are plants  that have complete flowers and  at  the same time having  sets of individual male and/or  female flowers which show how  plastic is sexual development on them and there are  just other more interesting sexual  findings .  Such that I have decided in the Impermanence   of   Sexual Phenotypes  in Plants. Pls read the Impermanence of Sexual  Phenotypes  which is available online. It synchronizes with this knowledge I had as provided by my professor friend  also from this great university that the most prestigious school of the world  [where he is] is offering such a degree with no XXX equivalent but don't play  with the professors in this univ... ha! I congratulate wholeheartedly this univ! This may soon be appearing as part of my third statement. my ist and second:  resolve the bias- s and t; r then  a..as key letters to remember.

Hacker.....05/13/2011 [Is vertical articulation a must or a "slap in the face"  professors we have are not really interested in opening the minds of the  students. All they want to teach is their own discipline their subject. Now  that is the death of liberal arts. Thats' no longer liberal arts, that's a professor's personal playpen". Also  the most prestigious university in the world is offering a masters degree in liberal arts to broaden the brains that had been tutored to  only one monotonous subject. This benefits the professors and students alike to  accumulate as much knowledge as their brains could accommodate. by I. Savillo`` 5/20/2011]  Considering right now that we are subjected to climate change and  no one is exempted- we need to be flexible and adaptable-- and how can one with  only one tutored knowledge (because of vertical articulation) survive this current  and future situation-- especially in third world countries-- that do not have the  exclusivity of the first world in terms of being helped and to help others... it's just like "drowning with the rest"**...There must be educational adaptation [adaptation  will apply in the educational academic system] and flexibility academically and  practically to satisfy climate change's call for protection, mitigation and adaptation.  [At least we will learn how to control climate change ( even a bit as of now) rather  than let climate change control us all of the time]. We are in an emergency state.  We need to  repair, establish, maintain a lot of ecosystems in order to survive during  the perturbations of  climate change. The more multitasking, the more -in expertise an  individual is, the more  lives can be saved. Climate Change is an era not just for a couple of years. Last May  2011,  NAS USA released a new statement (May 12, 2011)  (sent to me by NAS USA)  which is  America's Climate Choices- it is high time to take serious  look at what are the best choices for you, me or us in order to protect us from, ways of adapting to  or mitigating  climate change. We need to find and practice the best choices.  -  In addition, I cited a  statement from an author in my future international  keynote speech  that "change in climate  inflicts faster than the species can adapt"- so considering that we would like to repair the  life cycle of a commercial species that was affected by climate change,  in such an urgent  situation we need new and immediate ample knowledge to bring back  the ambient qualities  of that particular ecosystem so the species can later complete its life  cycle favorably and  continuously give food to an executive or a molecular biologist sitting in a towering  building. A multi- tasking or multi- in expertise individual is needed otherwise the  situation  will remain null in such an urgency, and it will be a - ** "Stare and drown with the rest"  scenario- this applies to all urgent situations- directly@ or indirectly@@ affecting all types  of ecosystem. Just like webs or networks of life that climate change badly affects or  erodes  the same thing is true with the webs or networks of life that wrong climate  choices will badly affect. And its failure will be felt far and wide.  Legend: @- immediate effect (usually lethal); @@- there is an effect  (usually "lethal" but quite delayed) [06/1/2011] Any moving macro-animal can be petted. The farther it is from the topmost food chain and the more petted are greater. In any situation they may be friends [to humans as pets*] except when they are   “on heat” or has something to do with reproduction but these pesky responses can also be alleviated.  In my observation, animals in nature are not “wild”. [As to my experience in one african country,  the wild birds in abundance can nest in your tomato plants-- or might as well say "treat humans  just like any wild animals in the field".] They only become such["wild"] when they receive unfriendly  treatments from humans common in civilized settings. And these unfriendly treatments are very well  memorized if without proper “remediation” and that this has to be considered as appropriate otherwise  they become untamed or "unfriendly" or "wild". *pets at home or in the wild Terminologies:wild- living with nature unperturbed by humans- easier to pet; "wild"- living with nature perturbed by humans- difficult to pet by Isidro T.

As stated by the authors, Zac Hanley and Kieran Elborough, "If GURT (Genetic Use Restriction Technologies) research had not been inhibited, would the transgenes in today's elite GE  maize be constrained by guaranteed pollen sterility, or be automatically deleted  from the genome at the initiation of the reproductive growth phase? Perhaps not  given the timeframe available, but if GURTs are finally recognized as valuable tools for biotechnology industry when used in the appropriate context, they should provide  safeguards against similar occurences."[From: ISB] In 1998, Isidro Savillo has quite a  similar concern when he wrote The Science of Genetic Control."

Savillo An Introduction to SYSTEMS BIOLOGY are focused to the minute analyses of the cellular and molecular mechanisms  which are the pillars of structural, behavioral and physiological  phenotypes that our lives are seated upon. phenomenal existence of the GENE. Can the Gene be expressed without  being influenced by its environment? How "constitutive" are the  constitutive genes? In my paper, "The Overpowering Influence of the  Environment to Gene Expression," I introduced the earth as a  "biological incubator" for all living organisms. The abiotic components  of the environment are essential for its "incubatory" mechanisms for  our genes/cells  to function though the optimal range is broad for most.  I introduced two types of  environment: the exogenous and endogenous  environments. The exogenous  environment may be an abiotic or  a biotic product influencing the individual. Thus, it  may come from  the chemicals, heat, etc. or someone else's genes. The endogenous  environment comprise of physical factors (e.g. temperature, hydration, pressure, etc)  which may be independent of the genes but if not for the exogenous environment,  they could not have been a part of the cellular metabolism. Most of the endogenous  environments are products of the genes of the individual and the physical factors which are produced as a result of it or by their various biochemical interactions. of the abiotic exogenous environments we are in and how it managed to  allow  both the biotic and abiotic exogenous environmental factors to further influence  the endogenous environment for the expression of genes. queries which target the specificity of the genes. Are genes strong enough to defy  environmental influences? Do we have to adjust to the needs of our genes?  Our genes respond to any environmental influences and this would eventually  lead to the death or survival of the organism. Considering that our genes have the imperfect components, adjusting to the needs of our genes may help but  putting up a perfect environmental condition is impossible. The interactions of  various environmental factors are affecting various biochemical pathways or  evolving into one/many new pathways and specifically adjusting the numerous  exogenous and endogenous environments for these is difficult to attain. Genes  could  specifically produce phenotypic characteristics but in the presence of  certain types  of endogenous and exogenous environments, there may be some  forms of confusion leading to erroneous genetic products. In developmental biology, there are many  cellular and molecular interactions of non indigenous substances to  the cells of the embryo. Thus, the embryo is floating to new mixes of substances  which are not  the products of his own genetic materials. This could   contribute  to the modification of his phenotype. When it comes to sexes, I posed a question, Is there permanency in sexual phenotypes? How about the clones and the monozygotic  twins? It's time to stop saying that "they are phenotypically similar because they are  genotypically the same." How about "instincts?" Are there really instincts or are they  slaves  to environmental pulses or signals? In terms of behavioral analyses, what is  missing?# The molecular bridge from the exogenous environment to the  senses (via the endogenous environment) is one of those cellular and molecular  mechanisms that could eventually make out a complete picture of behavior which  had been usually gathered through observations and surveys. I have to introduce a  new field of  "Molecular Sociology Philosophy "to satisfy this option of in toto  comprehensive analyses. Absolutely, inherited genes are difficult to change. Can  you change your height or your looks? Thus, we live with it. If we have to change  a certain part of our phenotype, we  call that as "cosmetic genetics." The problems  of maintenance come in. It was not a part  of the familiarization processes of the  embryonic cells and new adjustments could rarely be recognized by the adult cells. Because one has a defective gene, it doesn't mean that  the environment has nothing  to do with it. But the environment is superior in allowing the gametes to fertilize  and produce an individual with a defective gene. Defective genes are important to  evolution. The wobbling of the nitrogenous bases will allow the most  adjusted  (depending on the appropriate protein structures called upon by the new environment) species to survive and reproduce. What about culture? Culture controls phenotype  evolution or expression and may not be favorable for some. These are just a few  of the major constructions I would like to work into as Part I of my research studies.  I think there is a need to change old knowledge for new or modify them to some extent. Once a theory is firmly established, it will  be subjected to molecular  (mathematical/biological) modelling. The pioneering knowledge taken from  these analyses are important for the betterment in the understanding of  ourselves in the  molecular and cellular levels.   "As a Psycho- analyst, I study all statements along the way and analyze how friendly they are to me when it remains as is rather than further exploit it." by Isidro T. Savillo 12/10/2012 How to beat an obsessive trodden emotion? Emotions are as varied as the proteins of the cell. They could assume several functions  and come out with a tiring but/or exciting kaleidoscopic manifestations of a persona. Obsessive wants are unrealistic and difficult to acquire in most instances. To get away with this behavioral thinking- one has to formulate a scene where the major protagonist is focused and weave a make believe story where at the end the overall conclusion is a neutral aspect of all parties concerned. In this manner obsession is lessened or lost.  By re- enacting this make believe story in ones mind a number of times so as to make it appear as if "realistic", this will lead to lessening memory retention for the protagonist and may soon remove the disturbing emotional kinks brought by obsessive thinking. by Isidro T.
