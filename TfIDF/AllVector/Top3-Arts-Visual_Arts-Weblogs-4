Eric has what looks likea really good show - or series of shows - this summer at No Foundation , in Toronto .

Joseph Montgomery NOTE of DISCORD -i don't live terribly far from this museum... back in 5/2012i emailed some curators here ( Susan Cross , Denise Markonish, + ) and at the Tang ( Megan Hyde , Rachel Seligman , Ian Berry ),inviting them to visit my studio... not a single one responded, even to decline. LAME!!...as non-profit museum 'curated' shows it's kind of sad; the artist'sNYC galleries do all the work getting these shows placed.
