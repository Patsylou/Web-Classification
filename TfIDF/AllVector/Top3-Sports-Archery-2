 Home Formed at the end of 1956 The Society of Archer-Antiquaries exists to further the study of the development of the bow and arrow across the world from earliest times until the present day and to consider all matters relating to the history of archery in general. Background In their search for prey, prehistoric bowmen have recorded the hunt in primitive paintings on cave walls. Military archers, horsed or on foot, have been prominent in the victories of the ancient world; not least amongst these were the longbowmen of medieval England, whose mastery of their weapon won them battles against great odds. In the wilder parts of todays world can still be found those who hunt with the bow and arrow for the food by which they live. As a member you can read of each and much more within the Societys Annual Journals. Membership Your interest may be general or specific, academic or non-academic; but whatever course it takes you can be certain the Society will help you to learn more of the whole fascinating story of archery, whilst it will also welcome your own contribution to its collective store of knowledge. The Society is open to all with a thirst for knowledge or with wisdom to pass on, and is international in membership.
