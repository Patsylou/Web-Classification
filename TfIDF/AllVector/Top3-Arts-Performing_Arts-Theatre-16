Add the first question. User Reviews Best darn night of my life... LOTRmerrysgrl3 See all my reviews I was lucky enough to be able to attend the Tonys this year and I must say, even though I was in the second to last row of the highest balcony, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. To be able to be in the same room with some of the best musical/Broadway performers in the world was a dream come true. Watching Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth belting Defying Gravity and Hugh Jackman making Sarah Jessica Parker dance... That was incredible. I'm so happy for all of the winners (except for Best Musical) and everyone else who was up for an award. There's always next year.
