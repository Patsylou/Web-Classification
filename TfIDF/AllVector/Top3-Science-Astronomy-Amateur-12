NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit is taking movies of dust devils -- whirlwinds carrying dust -- scooting across a plain on Mars. These were taken on April 15 and April 18, and capture more movement as seen from the surface than any previous imaging of martian dust devils. "This is the best look we've ever gotten of the wind effects on the martian surface as they are happening," said Dr. Mark Lemmon, a rover team member and atmospheric scientist at Texas AM University, College Station. search  for links: provided  by astronomylinks.com
