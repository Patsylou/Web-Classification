In June 2009, ParaStationV5 propelled the 3288 node JuRoPA cluster at the Jülich Supercomputer Centre to an impressive 274,8 Teraflops of sustained performance with a parallel efficiency of 91,6% . At that time JuRoPA Ranked No. 10 in the World and No. 1 in Europe of the most powerful general purpose supercomputers ( top500.org ). ParaStationMPI was shown to scale to more than 25,000 MPI processes (without threading) on this machine.  JuRoPA was inaugurated May 26, 2009by the German Federal Minister for Education and Research, Prof. Dr. Annette Schavan, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Dr. Jürgen Rüttgers, and Prof. Dr. Achim Bachem, Chairman of the Bord of Directors at Research Center Jülich as well as high-ranking international guests from academia, industry and politics. ParTec - Your Trusted Partner delivering - High Availability - Scalability - Maximum Utilization ParTec understands that in todays economic climate the largest HPC installations have demanding requirements in areas such as power consumption and cooling efficiency. However, effective use of resources demands that equal attention be given to system availability , system utilization and parallel efficiency (scaling). ParTec has developed software, administration tools, maintenance techniques and scheduling policies which maximize machine utilization and give our customers maximum return on their investment.
