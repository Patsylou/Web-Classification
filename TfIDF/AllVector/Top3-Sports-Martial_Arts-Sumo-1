If I’m able to go into the ring relaxed, that will be best.” Kakuryu lost his first bout in January’s New Year basho, but reeled off 14 straight wins, including a clutch final-day victory over yokozuna Hakuho that forced a championship playoff. Hakuho, however, won the playoff between the two Mongolians to earn his 28th career championship.
