The Night Sky Astronomy Education Wednesday, 5 March 2014 7:00 PM In this session, we will look at the Night Sky and discuss the mechanics of the celestial sphere. Learn how to find your way around the sky and become familiar with common terms. We will also look at some of the brighter stars which are high in the sky in autumn and how to find them. The Tektite Story General Meeting Wednesday, 5 March 2014 8:00 PM According to some Aboriginal Dreaming stories the sky once rained ‘black hail’. This talk by Dr Olga Gostin addresses the characteristics of tektites (black glassy button-shaped stones), their likely provenance from a meteor impact site in tropical SE Asia, and the ongoing debate over their age, use and importance in the scientific and Aboriginal/archaeological context.
