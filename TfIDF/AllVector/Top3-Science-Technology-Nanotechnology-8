 RECENT NEWS: The Feynman Lectures on Physics Australian group See Ray Kurzweil's QA about the Singularity The Future of 3D Printing (which illustrates what a low-resolution nanofactory looks like) from Ralph Merkle's from Just give me the FAQ If we rearrange the atoms in coal we can make diamond. If we rearrange the atoms in sand If we rearrange the atoms in dirt, water and air we can make potatoes. In the future, nanotechnology (more specifically, molecular nanotechnology molecular nanotechnology illustrated at left. Molecular nanotechnology will be the physical foundation for the Singularity . Positional assembly Massive parallelism molecular robotics Feynman said in a putting lots nanofactory Some Frequently Asked Questions Aren't there scientists who say it's impossible? Don't thermal noise, quantum uncertainty, entropy or something make molecular machines impossible? What is the Singularity? What should I study to enter the field of nanotechnology?
