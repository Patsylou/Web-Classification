 Opinions on the art and practice of oral storytelling, and the American storytelling revival. Sunday, August 17, 2008 R.I.P. Doc Mcconnell A staple of the Jonesborough Festival has passed.

Millie Monday, May 26, 2008 storyteller obituary Wednesday, May 14, 2008 Variety Reviews John Lithgow, Storyteller Variety lists the show as a "play," and it does have a director. And it does take place in a theater. But apparently the show is mostly Mr. Lithgow telling stories of his family, and of the role stories and storytelling played in his family. The show includes recitations of poetry by Oliver Wendell Holmes and prose by P.G. Wodehouse. I found this quote illuminating: ...(the play) encourages auds to make their own connection to the material, without demanding that we celebrate Lithgow's life. He grounds the classics by explaining what they meant to his family, but his biography is supporting material, not the solipsistic main event. Millie Wednesday, May 14, 2008 theatre Monday, March 10, 2008 Sometimes I Wish I Lived in Alabama Now I just learned that the Birmingham Museum of Art is hosting a retrospective of her work-- not her storytelling, mind you, but 50 years of black and white photographs, including some taken with her first Brownie, purchased in 1930. Most, I gather, were taken during her career as a journalist. Most depict small town life in Alabama from the Depression through the Civil Rights era. I suspect, given Kathyrn's eye for detail in her storytelling, and her career that took her across the state, that she captured some wonderful images on film. Wish I could see them. If by some chance, you're passing through Alabama before May 25, stop by the exhibit , and let me know what you thought. Millie Monday, March 10, 2008 Friday, February 29, 2008 Baby Storytelling search on "storyteller," you get a host of precious thirty second to two minute home videos of toddlers babbling. (Actually, you first get a lot of pirated clips from Jim Henson's The Storyteller series, but that's a post for another day) So. The home movies. The chatty babies. Their doting parents and grandparents immediately tag or title the clip "storyteller." It took me ages to figure out why. I think it's because they are capturing their child caught up in the joy of language, the sound of language, the music of it. For the first time, they see their child not demanding food, or sleep, or a beloved object out of reach. Suddenly they see that their child is doing something with language beyond expressing direct needs. Interesting that they call this "storytelling," and not "poetry" or "echolalia" or "mouth music." I don't believe for a moment that a one-year old is trying to express a narrative by this babbling, as extensive as it is. They're not telling a story.
