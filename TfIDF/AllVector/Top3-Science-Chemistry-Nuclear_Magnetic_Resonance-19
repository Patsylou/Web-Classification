 Main Page From NMR Wiki Jump to: navigation , search NMR Wiki is an effort to promote sharing information, know-how and wisdom among researchers working in the field of Magnetic Resonance. Please, follow us on Twitter . (learn more) We collect NMR/EPR/MRI teaching materials, lab and software manuals, Ph.D. theses and pulse sequences upload them here or just email to inbox@nmrwiki.org . Here is the list of recent contributions . Thanks! Welcome new users!
