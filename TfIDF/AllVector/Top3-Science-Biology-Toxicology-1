Announcing INHAND Nomenclature Change Control INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions) is a joint initiative of the STP, ESTP, BSTP and JSTP to develop an internationally-accepted nomenclature for proliferative and non-proliferative lesions in laboratory animals. The INHAND nomenclature is being adopted by the US FDA for use in the SEND initiative (Standard for the Exchange of Nonclinical Data). Pathologists who discover a lesion in a toxicity study that is not covered by the INHAND nomenclature are encouraged to request a new INHAND term. In addition, changes, additions, and updates to current terms may be desirable and may be requested. (DOI: 10.1111/vcp.12059).
