PASCALE CHAMPAGNE Associate Professor, Department of Civil Engineering Dr. Pascale Champagne - a leading researcher in environmental engineering - is developing a process to extract useable organic materials from waste biomass, such as livestock manure and forestry residue, and convert them into valuable chemicals and sources of energy, like biofuel. Aiming to develop alternate technologies and sustainable environmental practices, Professor Champagne is also working to engineer better processes for waste management to minimize the impact of municipal, agricultural and industrial activities.
