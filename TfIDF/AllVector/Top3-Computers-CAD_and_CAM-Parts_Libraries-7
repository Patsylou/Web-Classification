 "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." "Leaders have to act more quickly today. The pressure comes much faster." "Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school." "The world is changing very fast. Big will not beat the small anymore. It will be the fast beating the slow." (Robert Murdoch) "Technology is always evolving, and companies can’t be afraid to take advantage of change." "If you don’t change, reality in the end forces that change upon you." Home Why CAD files?
