Posted by enrico on Oct 27, 2008 in Blog , WorldWideSketchCrawl Wow, what a fantastic day out!! The San Francisco chapter... about us SketchaWhat? Three or four years ago a good friend of mine had a fun bachelor party consisting of visiting ten bars and pubs along the N-Juda Muni tram line: a . And crawling we did, in fact we didnt make it past the seventh pub. Quite the night, but that is where I got the idea for the name SketchCrawl when a few months later I decided to do a whole day of intense drawing around the city. The basic idea: to record nonstop everything I could around me with my pencil and watercolors. A drawn journal filled with details ranging from the all the coffee I drank to the different buses I took. After a whole day of drawing and walking around the city the name seemed quite fitting: a drawing marathon. The crawl was more tiring than I imagined but also more fun and exciting than I had thought. Giving yourself this kind of mandate for a full day changes the way you look around you. It makes you stop and see things just a tad longer, just a bit deeper needless to say I loved it. I soon figured out it was much more interesting to do the marathon with a group of artists instead of all by myself! And so SketchCrawl turned communal. After a whole day of drawing it proved to be amazingly interesting and inspiring to share and compare other peoples drawings and thoughts. Different takes on our surroundings, different details, different sensibilities. The next step was making the SketchCrawl a World Wide event: having people from different corners of the world join in a day of sketching and journaling and then, thanks to the Internet, having everyone share the results on an online forum. So here it is, we have a website now, a few Crawls behind me, some by myself some with friends and artists from around the world and hopefully plenty SketchCrawls ahead of us. - Enrico Casarosa, San Francisco, California February 2006 more info Home Materials Past SketchCrawls sketchcrawl is by Enrico Casarosa | Maintained by imageswithin.com
