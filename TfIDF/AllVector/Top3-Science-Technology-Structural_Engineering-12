 STRUCTURAL DESIGN SOFTWARE Foundation Lateral Concrete Steel Aluminum & Glass Masonry Bridge Wood Technical Support This web site provides structural design software which created using Microsoft Windows Excel 2010/2013 (32 bit default installation). Each spreadsheet contains formulas, reference code sections, and graphic drawings. The software are nice and easy on all Win 8 Tablet/PAD. The analysis results can be copied and pasted to AutoCAD. The Example is intended for re-use and is loaded with floating comments as well as ActiveX pull-down menus for variable choices. All intermediate calculations are intended for submittal with the calculations to explain the results of the input. It is free to download, by click software name, for limited version (demo only). For professional version (xlsb/xls filename extension), a Package of all 238 listed software, the normal price is $1760 ( $8 per software ). (What's New?)
