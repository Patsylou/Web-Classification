It operates three sites in Chile La Silla , Paranal and Chajnantor on behalf of its fifteen member states. It builds ALMA together with international partners, and designs the European Extremely Large Telescope . ESO, the European Southern Observatory, builds and operates a suite of the world's most advanced ground-based astronomical telescopes View all | Subscribe | Press Releases 19 February 2014 - Photo Release eso1406 Diamonds in the Tail of the Scorpion New ESO image of star cluster Messier 7 A new image from ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile shows the bright star cluster Messier 7. Easily spotted with the naked eye close to the tail of the constellation of Scorpius, it is one of the most prominent open clusters of stars in the sky — making it an important astronomical research target. 5 February 2014 - Science Release eso1405 The Anatomy of an Asteroid ESO’s New Technology Telescope (NTT) has been used to find the first evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure. By making exquisitely precise measurements astronomers have found that different parts of the asteroid Itokawa have different densities. As well as revealing secrets about the asteroid’s formation, finding out what lies below the surface of asteroids may also shed light on what happens when bodies collide in the Solar System, and provide clues about how planets form. 29 January 2014 - Science Release eso1404 First Weather Map of Brown Dwarf ESO’s VLT charts surface of nearest brown dwarf ESOs Very Large Telescope has been used to create the first ever map of the weather on the surface of the nearest brown dwarf to Earth. An international team has made a chart of the dark and light features on WISE J104915.57-531906.1B, which is informally known as Luhman 16B and is one of two recently discovered brown dwarfs forming a pair only six light-years from the Sun. The new results are being published in the 30 January 2014 issue of the journal Nature. 22 January 2014 - Photo Release eso1403 Sneak Preview of Survey Telescope Treasure Trove VST images the Lagoon Nebula The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at ESOs Paranal Observatory in Chile has captured this richly detailed new image of the Lagoon Nebula. This giant cloud of gas and dust is creating intensely bright young stars, and is home to young stellar clusters. This image is a tiny part of just one of eleven public surveys of the sky now in progress using ESO telescopes. Together these are providing a vast legacy of publicly available data for the global astronomical community. 15 January 2014 - Science Release eso1402 First Planet Found Around Solar Twin in Star Cluster Six-year search with HARPS finds three new planets in Messier 67 Astronomers have used ESOs HARPS planet hunter in Chile, along with other telescopes around the world, to discover three planets orbiting stars in the cluster Messier 67. Although more than one thousand planets outside the Solar System are now confirmed, only a handful have been found in star clusters. Remarkably one of these new exoplanets is orbiting a star that is a rare solar twin — a star that is almost identical to the Sun in all respects.
