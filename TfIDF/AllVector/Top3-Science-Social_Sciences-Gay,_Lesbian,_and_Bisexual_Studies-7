Currently, we are focused on the topic of religion and sexual orientation. Through conducting research on important issues like this, our ultimate goal is to help counselors, psychologists and other mental health professionals better understand the experiences of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and others who experience same-sex attraction. We intend to provide a place for people from across the country to learn about current perspectives and assist in furthering supportive research by completing surveys on different topics from time to time.
