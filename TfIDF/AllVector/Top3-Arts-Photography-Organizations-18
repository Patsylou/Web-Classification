Mini Seminar 6: Unmanned Aerial Photography Monday February 10th. A little about us… flitelab.com  came out of a growing interest in RC, and more specifically, the multi-rotor area of the hobby.  With the DIY approach of most RC projects and the niche segment of multi-rotors, it is an on-going challenge to find the best components and get them shipped to Canada in a reliable and timely fashion, not knowing what surprises might arise from customs and related fees along the way.  With so many options coming out on a regular basis from all corners of the world, it is often a “try and hope” approach to see what you get after placing an order and not knowing how long the wait might be for it to arrive. To help address these issues and help give something back to other Canadian hobbyists,  flitelab.com  was born.  Taking the ever-growing research knowledge and trial error usage of various components, we hope to bring a selection of good quality, useful products directly to Canada, creating a source within the country, and help reduce some of the headaches and delays noted above for both those established and new to the hobby. This has further grown into more business areas, with us now offering commercial UAV sales, support, and related aerial imaging services. We hope you find some valuable information and products here that can help grow your involvement and passion with the hobby or with your business needs.
