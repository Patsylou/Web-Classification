 Home Philosophy Founder Masters Schools Merchandise Newsletter        Affiliates     Greetings! I would like to welcome you to the new official Han Mu Do homepage. I hope that you will enjoy browsing through the pages to learn more about Han Mu Do as a traditional Korean martial art, as well as to learn about Korean history and culture. It is my purpose, through more than fifty-five years of research, study, and training, to provide to you one of the most comprehensive martial arts in existence and a better understanding of how Korean culture and history has shaped the development of modern martial arts. The World Han Mu Do Association has schools throughout the world; North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The spread of Han Mu Do throughout the world has a three point focus; “cultivate your personal talents,” “use those talents to help other people,” “in helping others you make the world a better place to live.” Feel free to contact our association with any questions that you may have. We offer introductory training seminars and clinics on a regular schedule. I hope to hear from you! DR.
