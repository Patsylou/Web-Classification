Yet we easily attribute intelligence, humanity, and even personality to them: ELIZA seems distant and oddly disengaged; Hex seems louder, a bit obnoxious and rambunctious.

This process of categorization is what makes society possible, allowing us to quickly ascertain our relationship to a new acquaintance.

In the context of the Imitation Game, providing an image purporting to be of the participant would be easy even for an unsophisticated computer program to provide, and could influence the judge towards perceiving the mechanical subject as human. Rheingold 1993 ]. The claim is that these visual categorization cues distort the our view of the other, whereas the unadorned letters of the textual environment allow one's ideas to be conveyed without prejudice. The underlying argument is that the knowledge of the other that we seek is knowledge of inner state, which is best understood from one's words as direct output of the mind, as opposed to physical features, which are incidental though highly influential in shaping other's opinions of one. Ekman 1992 ] 4 . If the traits in question do not have a visible component or if the visual component is an imperfect cue, deception may be easier in a more visual environment, for the visual display holds out the apparent (though potentially false) promise of immediately perceivable authenticity and thus participants may be less guarded in this familiar and seemingly transparent medium. Herring 1994 Tannen 1996 ]. While the large number of poorly disguised men masquerading as women online shows that this knowledge is neither obvious nor commonplace, performing a convincing impersonation in a text environment is not beyond the abilities of an astute observer of social dynamics. In a live video environment, subsequent interactions require a far more extensive understanding of gendered discourse, expression, gesture etc. While this is not impossible, as evidenced by the existence of highly convincing drag queens, it requires considerable skill, observation and a degree of natural aptitude. Most of the textual world's putative and convincing females would be revealed as males in a video environment. Sproull Kiesler 1991 Paulos and Canny 1998 Foner 1997 ELIZA .
