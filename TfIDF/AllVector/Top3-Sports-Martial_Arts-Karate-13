We had a wonderful time training with Terauchi Sensei and catching up with fellow members from across Canada, the USA and Bermuda. It is really humbling to meet Terauchi Sensei and to catch yet another glimpse of the human potential that can be achieved through vigilant practice in the art of karate. The Friendship Dinner was also fun, a great opportunity to catch up with our friends outside of training and laugh together. The video of Terauchi Sensei was very entertaining. One thing we forgot to do when we finished our act for the talent show was to thank Jan Dracek for being such a good sport. The last few times we were faced with having to find an act for a talent show (2008 2009), Jan has always bailed us out with her fabulous singing voice and so she did again (yes that was her singing!). Thanks once again to you, everyone who volunteered in setting up the event and especially Terauchi Sensei! It was another great event!
