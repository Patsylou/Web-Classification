As an educator, I am a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Technology and Engineering Graphics instructor at Kishwaukee College. I am proud of the fact that our college's CAD program website is the oldest on the web and comes up top ranked in most search engines. The link at right offers that website while the link at the top of this page offers my page. As an illustrator, my GD Matrix and Isometric Dimensioning in AutoCAD © wall charts and handouts are featured in the Hearlihy catalog and I have other ideas as works in progress. The link at right offers their website while the link at the top of this page offers my page. As a writer, my text-workbook, "Descriptive Geometry in Pencil and Pixels", is doing well with Stipes Publishing Company L.L.C. This book allows me to offer this course online now. The link at right offers their website while the link at the top of this page offers my page. I am currently working on an original way to better teach CAD to beginners. Take a look at where I am at in the process. The link at right and the top of the page offer my problem folder page. For 15 years I played as a slow pitch softball pitcher for several churches and the Rockford Rescue Mission where our team regularly took top spots. I am currently without a team but would love to get back into it. The link at the right offers some pictures and great memories of past years played as a pitcher at Rockford's Sport Score Park.
