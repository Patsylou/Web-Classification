Apart from circumnavigating Viti Levu, the main island, I have no plans other than taking up my new underwater camera and swimming around in shallowishwater. I don't want to go outside the reefs where the water is deep and dark. The blackness below scares me. In 1930 Matisse spent time in Tahiti, he spent time underwater as well. Seaweed became one of his motifs. I don't know whether to call this influence or not but I have taken photographs that remind me of his work. Here is a link to a six minute film about Matisse and his final work. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APaXLXAVkmQ 4:16 pm Wednesday, June 26 Three Lions In my photographic career I have made 3 Lion photographs. One quality they have in common is that none of the Lions are real, that's not deliberate on my part I promise. The topLion is a new arrival in New Plymouth, up against a mural and outside a hotel that opened 2 weeks ago, a hotel called King Queen, The middle Lion is glass and living on a window ledge, it's back facing west towards the sunset, probably ten years ago. The earliest of these photos, the bottom one, is the Lion head against a brick wall. I hadgone for a walk from my Copenhagen hotel 15 years ago and come across some land with a storage collection of statues like this. 8:21 pm Thursday, June 20 Kai Iwi Lakes I've just returned from a photographic expedition to Northland. As usual, no matter where I went I was always looking for a new photo. Actually, I'm like that even when I'm at home, it doesn't seem to make any difference where I am. I could be in the kitchen or even the bathroom. The branchy photo above was taken at Kai Iwi Lakes, about 40 minutes north of Dargaville. The shrubs, probably manuka, have been drowned by rising fresh water. Lakes are being formed by advancing sand hills, very like Bethels. The Virginia Creeper below is from a wall in Clyde, Central Otago, about 4 years ago. I've included it in this post because it immediately reminded of the swamp photo and I enjoy comparing. 9:21 pm Monday, May 27 White Swan About three months ago I bought this object in Eltham, South Taranaki. I was immediately intrigued by it. After a couple of months , I turned it around, suddenly realising that the reverse side was just as interesting. A little while later I also realised that its shape reminded me of another photo, one that I had posted on my last post way back on February 21st. 6:59 pm Thursday, February 21 Revisiting 6:13 pm Monday, January 21 Sabre Socks The lower photo I took today. I'm sorting my socks, trying to match them up, and make pairs. The upper photo I took of a Napier Sabre engine, 2000 horse power plus. This is in a museum in Christchurch. 7:33 pm Thursday, December 20 Slaughter 1981 I am involved in a major project where I am going through all of my old negatives to see if I have missed any images that could be printed up, or, in some cases to find negatives that I knew, or rather hoped were there, but have been lost for years. I was very glad to come across the negative of Slaughter 1981, taken at a time when I was in my early days as a photographer. I think that I made, one, maybe two prints mainly for my personal enjoyment. I don't know where the prints are now. It was taken on the same occasion that Itook Farm Study. In fact all of the sheep in Farm Study were on their way to be killed. The top photo shows one of them. However, it would be remiss of me not to include another photo in this post, the colour one below and called Carcass, taken a couple of years ago. Needless to say this image has not been one of my big sellers. By the way, this sheep in not real. 4:19 pm Older Posts Home Posts (Atom) peter@peryer.co.nz peter@peryer.co.nz 2 Dale St Lower Vogeltown New Plymouth 4310 021 669879 Blog Archive Blog Archive July (2) June (2) May (1) February (1) January (1) December (6) November (12) August (2) July (9) June (3) May (2) April (4) January (4) November (3) October (8) September (3) August (5) July (7) June (6) May (7) April (4) March (4) February (10) January (11) December (5) November (6) October (19) September (12) July (18) June (13) May (30) April (22) March (10) February (4) January (5) December (7) November (7) October (10) September (10) August (17) July (9) June (3) May (3) April (10) March (5) February (2) January (2) December (2) November (4) October (13) September (18) August (11) July (18) June (24) May (23) April (24) March (27) February (19) January (3) December (13) November (25) October (37) September (26) August (5) July (6) June (5) May (8) April (12) March (25) February (35) January (17) December (37) November (18)
