 The David E. Rumelhart Prize For Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition Home About Rumelhart Recipients Prize Selection The Medal Symposia Home The David E. Rumelhart Prize is awarded annually to an individual or collaborative team making a significant contemporary contribution to the theoretical foundations of human cognition. Contributions may be formal in nature: mathematical modeling of human cognitive processes, formal analysis of language and other products of human cognitive activity, and computational analyses of human cognition using symbolic or non-symbolic frameworks all fall within the scope of the award. The David E. Rumelhart Prize is funded by the Robert J. Glushko and Pamela Samuelson Foundation. Robert J. Glushko received a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the University of California, San Diego in 1979 under Rumelharts supervision. He is an Adjunct Full Professor at the School of Information (I-School) at the University of California, Berkeley. The prize consists of a hand-crafted, custom bronze medal , a certificate, a citation of the awardees contribution, and a monetary award of $100,000. The 2014 David E. Rumelhart Prize Recipient The recipient of the fourteenth David E. Rumelhart Prize is Ray Jackendoff , one of the worldâ€™s leading figures in the cognitive science of language. He has developed a theory of language that articulates the contribution of each level of linguistic representation and their interaction, while also elucidating how language relates to other cognitive systems. Dr. Jackendoff is Seth Merrin Professor of Philosophy and Co-Director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. After receiving his BA in Mathematics from Swarthmore College in 1965, he completed his PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 1969, under the supervision of Noam Chomsky. He then joined the faculty at Brandeis University, where he remained until 2005, until taking up his current position at Tufts. Jackendoff is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, of the Linguistic Society of America, and of the Cognitive Science Society.
