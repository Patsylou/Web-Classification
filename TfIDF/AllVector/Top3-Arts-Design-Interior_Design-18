This year's competition asked 34 teams of third-year design students to cast ahead to the next 100 years in Arizonas history and solve challenges residents will face. more innovate http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/innovationspace.jpg InnovationSpace is an entrepreneurial joint venture among the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts, Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. The goal of our transdisciplinary education and research lab is to teach students how to develop products that create market value while serving real societal needs and minimizing impacts on the environment. transform http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/sala_transform.jpg The Design School students work with faculty, the city and neighborhoods designing new pedestrian infrastructures to revitalize a disenfranchised commericial corridor. pioneer http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/id051612.jpg Industrial Design prepares students for a professional career in product design and development. Pictured here is the annual senior exhibition. By developing products that are innovative, useful, safe, aesthetically appropriate, ecologically sound and socially beneficial, the industrial design profession serves the needs of society, consumers, manufacturers and the environment. thrive http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/sparky.jpg Sun Devil spirit blossoms with the maroon-throated, golden-petaled plant developed by horticulturist George Hull, a faculty associate in The Design Schools landscape architecture program. Proceeds from sales are earmarked by Hull for the schools landscape architecture program. Hull intends to introduce a more diminutive version of next year. more collaborate http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/algae_farm.jpg The winning team in the 2012 Cluster competition created an algae farm that turned waste products into biosustainable fuel, a solution for the energy problems Arizona will encounter in the next 100 years.

Students learn to utilize multiple presentation methods to communicate 3D design solutions to clients. discover http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/viscom.jpg Visual Communication Design emphasizes appropriate strategic communication through a design process that includes research, analysis, conceptualization planning, and realization. Students integrate theory and method, culture and context, environmental and human factors, traditional and contemporary technologies, and visual aesthetics to develop comprehensive design strategies. vision http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/programs.jpg The Design School offers degrees in architecture, industrial design, interior design, landscape architecture, urban design, and visual communication (graphic) design synthesize http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/sala_synthesize.jpg Architecture, landscape architecture, construction, visual communication and industrial design students collaborate in interdisciplinary research and design studios allowing them to fuse their knowledge in world-class facilities such as ASUs Decision Theater, a multi-screen digital research and decision lab that uses visualization, simulation and collaboration tools to address emerging sustainability challenges. define http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/senior_show12.jpg Seniors in all five design disciplines collaborated for solutions to today's tough challenges from obesity to diminishing resources. Their research projects were showcased at The Icehouse in downtown Phoenix during an event that celebrated their innovation and creativity and their graduation. synthesize http://design.asu.edu/slideshow/photos/set0/sala_synthesize.jpg Architecture, landscape architecture, construction, visual communication and industrial design students collaborate in interdisciplinary research and design studios allowing them to fuse their knowledge in world-class facilities such as ASUs Decision Theater, a multi-screen digital research and decision lab that uses visualization, simulation and collaboration tools to address emerging sustainability challenges.
