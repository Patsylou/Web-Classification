"Crime" is constructed and negotiated in social discourses and processes of social interaction in and with institutions of social control. Therefore only qualitative inquiries of "crime" make sense. This paper reports examples of qualitative studies (from ethnography, hermeneutical sociology of knowledge, ethnomethodology/conversation analysis, discourse analysis and narrative analysis) especially of deviant subcultures, reporting conflicts to the police, police inquiries and interrogations and criminal court procedures. Keywords crime as social construction; second code of the criminal justice system; ethnography; ethnomethodology; discourse analysis; narrative analysis Full Text: HTML (Deutsch) PDF (Deutsch) HTML PDF © 1999-2014 Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627) Supported by the Institute for Qualitative Research and the Center for Digital Systems , Freie Universität Berlin
