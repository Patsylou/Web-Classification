Itis one of only two events in Scotland still providing for print workers around the world, the other being the Edinburgh International. Annually we have seen work submitted from approximately, fifty-two Countries around the World. The accepted entries are exhibited to the general public, for two to three weeks during May/June. A catalogue is also produced and sent to all of the entrants ( FIAP 4 star rating for 2013 ). There is a tremendous amount of work in putting on an Annual event of this size, and unfortunately the Scottish Salon fell into abeyance for a few years after running its 89th Exhibition in 2008. Our 2013 return saw us receive a the biggest print entry we have ever had. A very big thank you to all our entrants. We are indebted to those who havehelped to restorethis eventthe 91st Scottish International Salon in 2014.
