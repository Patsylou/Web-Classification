Desire! Is it in you? Sacramento SantaÂ Monica Since our start in 1998, we have cultivated a exercise program based on competitive boxing and transformed it into the ultimate workout for you! This new, 45 minute fitness concept combined cardiovascular conditioning, boxing technique and some strength training within a safe, effective, progressive and systematic program. Realizing that people really enjoyed the personalized, small group training, Angelo and Cary kept their class/camp sizes small.
