Metafer MNScore: Micronuclei Analysis in Environmental Studies In conlusion, this work is the first human biomonitoring study focused on the measurement of MN by automated image analysis for assessing chromosomal damage as a result of environmental mutagen exposure. [...] Further, our findings indicate the ability of the automated system to easily analyze slides with a low density of cells that would be very laborious to score using visual analysis. [...] Furthermore, we suggest that the classifier setting used in this work be used in other biomonitoring studies to allow for comparable inter-laboratory results. Cited from: The impact of air pollution on the levels of micronuclei measured by automated image analysis.
