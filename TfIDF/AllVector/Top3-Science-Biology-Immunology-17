First , since the numbering scheme was (a fairly limited set), the Second , the numbering adopts a rigid specification The numbering throughout the chains is as follows: Light chain Heavy chain The Chothia Numbering Scheme There are two disadvantages : first , the second , Chothia et al. changed . Note That in their latest paper (Al-Lazikani , (1997) JMB 273 ! Light chain Heavy chain Martin (Enhanced Chothia) Numbering Scheme A manuscript describing this new scheme is in preparation. Light chain Heavy chain Table of CDR Definitions A number of definitions of the CDRs are commonly in use: The Kabat definition The Chothia definition The AbM definition AbM antibody modelling software The contact definition Loop Kabat AbM Chothia 1 Contact 2 L1 L24--L34 L24--L34 L24--L34 L30--L36 L2 L50--L56 L50--L56 L50--L56 L46--L55 L3 L89--L97 L89--L97 L89--L97 L89--L96 H1 H31--H35B (Kabat Numbering) 3 H26--H35B H26--H32..34 H30--H35B H1 H31--H35 (Chothia Numbering) H26--H35 H26--H32 H30--H35 H2 H50--H65 H50--H58 H52--H56 H47--H58 H3 H95--H102 H95--H102 H95--H102 H93--H101 Note (1) Note (2) except the contact definition Note (3) If neither H35A nor H35B is present, the loop ends at H32 If only H35A is present, the loop ends at H33 If both H35A and H35B are present, the loop ends at H34 How to identify the CDRs by looking at a sequence Note CDR-L1 Start Approx residue 24 Residue before always a Cys Residue after always Length 10 to 17 residues CDR-L2 Start always 16 residues after the end of L1 Residues before Length always CDR-L3 Start always Residue before always Cys Residues after always Phe-Gly-XXX-Gly Length 7 to 11 residues CDR-H1 Start Approx residue 26 ( always Residues before always Cys-XXX-XXX-XXX Residues after always Length 10 to 12 residues [AbM definition]; CDR-H2 Start always Residues before Residues after Lys/Arg-Leu/Ile/Val/Phe/Thr/Ala-Thr/Ser/Ile/Ala Length Kabat definition 16 to 19 residues; CDR-H3 Start always always 2 after a Cys) Residues before always Cys-XXX-XXX (typically Cys-Ala-Arg) Residues after always Trp-Gly-XXX-Gly Length 3 to 25(!) residues Table of mean contact data J.
