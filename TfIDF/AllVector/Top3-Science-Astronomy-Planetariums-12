 Home :: Gallery :: Links :: Contact Welcome to the unofficial Eise Eisinga Planetarium site Eise Eisinga (1744 - 1828) Franeker , province of Friesland, The Netherlands, is the oldest working one in the world. It was built in the years 17741781. On Sunday, 8 May, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and our Moon will all be found in [the House of] Aries. They will surely collide and this will be the end of the world. A booklet on this subject will be available soon! (Viewstar-map) Dont forget to set the date ring correctly on the leap day. Check the speed of the clock during sudden temperature changes. Adjust the orbit of Saturn every year because I made a little miscalculation. Dont forget to paint new year numbers every 22 years.
