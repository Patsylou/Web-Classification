And suddenly, after her own secret is revealed, Alex finds herself confronted with two men vying for her heart: the safe and steady Rylan, who has always cared for her, and the dark, intriguing Damian. With hidden foes lurking around every corner, is Alex strong enough to save herself and the kingdom shes sworn to protect? Review: Defy is a powerful story wrought with mystery, intrigue, magic, and a bit of romance. Well-paced and thoroughly engaging from beginning to end, I couldn’t put this one down. This fantastic YA debut is surprising and unforgettable. I highly recommend this fantasy adventure for teens and adults alike. The sequel can’t come soon enough.

Still hunted by a team of assassins, they escape on the first available ship only to find themselves under the power of a sadistic captain. Even if they manage to survive this voyage, there is a trap waiting for them at the journey’s end that is beyond anything they can imagine. Review: A Wind in the Night is the 12th book in the Noble Dead saga, book 3 of series 3. I thoroughly enjoyed this new story in this rich, fantasy world. Full of mystery, intrigue, and interpersonal drama – it was hard to put down. The suspense builds with in a climactic finale for Wynn, Chane, Osha, and Shade. But it leaves off in a cliffhanger for Magiere and Leesil as they arrive at their destination, with enemies lying in wait. I eagerly await the next in the series as the story comes to a head. The strengths of this long-running series are the vivid characters and complex stories. This unique, high fantasy with vampires, elves, and other magical creatures never disappoints.

The fun spirit of the characters, the outlaw setting, an exciting adventure, and (of course) the ship itself make for an irresistible story. Avalon is the first in a promising, new, scifi adventure series. Wrought with danger, suspense, intrigue, drama, and betrayal – I enjoyed this story from beginning to end. It’s fast-paced, thrilling, and incredibly entertaining. Even though there is a dark intensity, there is still a light-hearted element that keeps the pace fresh and exciting. This space opera will appeal to teens and adults alike. I would have liked to see the main characters fleshed out a bit more. Hopefully, well get more of that in future installments. I look forward to, hopefully, many more adventures of the Avalon crew.
