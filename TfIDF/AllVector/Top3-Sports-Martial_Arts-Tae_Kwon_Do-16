Silence lets me hear that inner voice which always guides my body. For those willing to make the effort and commitment, the rewards are limitless. The essence of all martial arts was founded on a union between mind and body. One can go on forever developing perfection through Tae Kwon Do. It burns within many of us to seek perfection. Always go on searching for ways to develop yourself. Physical perfection is the ultimate goal of sports; self-perfection is the ultimate goal of martial arts.
