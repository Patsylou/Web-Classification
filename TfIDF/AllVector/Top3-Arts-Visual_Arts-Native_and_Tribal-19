Adam was amazing to watch during his demonstrations and then afterwards I paid him for a private consultation to help me stop smoking and not only did he remove the smoking addiction It gave me the opportunity to feel what it was like to truly be hypnotised helping me to understand why most hypnotherapists dont do good work because they just havent got the ability to put people in deep profound hypnosis like Adam does.
