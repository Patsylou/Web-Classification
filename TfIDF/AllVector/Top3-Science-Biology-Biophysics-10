The B-DNA possesses a spanning water network, and it is the loss of its continuity [ 1343 ] together with the competition between hydration and direct cation coupling to the free oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups [ 1394 441 816 ]. 930 707 708 ]. 1867 N4 /G N2 /T O2 A N6 /C O2 /G O6 A N3 /G N3 /G N7 /T O4 A N7 [ 1249 ]. 143 144 a b The total for all these hydrations, in a G 144 The hydration of the B-DNA minor groove is dependent on the DNA sequence with water-bridge lifetimes varying from 1 to 300 ps [ 1767 ], depending on the sequence; usually involving single water molecules connecting the strands but connection via pairs of water molecules, with varying interchange between these forms, may allow greater structural flexibility in the DNA and/or interaction with specific proteins [ 1605 = T duplex [ 145 ] (see right, where the water oxygen atoms are shown large green and red, where the red atoms are of the primary hydration water and the green atoms are of the secondary hydration water, [ 1136 146 ]. Thus, A = T duplex sequences favor water binding in the minor groove and also protein binding there driven by the large entropy release on this low entropy water's release [ 1136 1221 ]).

For example, about 110 water molecules are released on binding of the restriction endonuclease Eco RI to its site GAATTC leaving an essentially dry interface and firmly bound complex (with binding constant ~10,000 times that for nonspecific binding), whereas changing just one base out of the recognition sequence leaves those water molecules mostly unaffected and only little different from Eco RI non-specifically binding to DNA [ 1176b ]. Thus, the key to the formation of specific links between proteins and DNA is that the interfacial water molecules allow the protein facile movement along the binding cleft whilst retaining contact information [ 1443 ]. Final binding makes use of both direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds; for example, the restriction endonuclease MspI makes specific contacts with all eight bases in the four base pair recognition sequence (5'-CCGG-3' and complementary 3'-GGCC-5'), by six direct and five water-mediated hydrogen bonds and thirteen water-mediated links to the phosphates [ 1444 ]. Protein sliding along the DNA is assisted by uniform complementary electrostatic interactions between the positive protein and negative DNA as moderated by the intervening water, whereby the protein follows the helical pathway of the groove rather than jumping between the major groove and the more negative minor groove [ 1176c ]. Where negative charges exist on the protein that create unfavorable binding electrostatics, the similar charges may be screened, as shown right. It is important that a balance of positive and negative charges exist to ensure that the binding is generally not too strong, so avoiding excessive binding friction except where required. It has been (independently) proposed that the separation of DNA double helices is enabled by the formation of clathrate-like water structuring using its screening dipoles [ 1222 ], an idea that ties this basic life process to the ES CS equilibrium and its icosahedral water clusters. Highly structured water molecules, with lengthy residence times, have been found to be essential for the structural dynamics and function of ribozymes [ 1106 ] (catalytically competent highly structured noncoding RNAs) where water communicates structural rearrangements in an analogous manner to its action around many proteins Back to Top ] .
