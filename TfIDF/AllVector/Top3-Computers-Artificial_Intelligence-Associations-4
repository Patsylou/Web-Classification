Founded in 1964, the society has an international membership drawn from both academia and industry. It is a member of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (see ECCAI benefits). AISB is a thriving learned society which invites membership from people with a serious interest in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and related areas. There are six types of membership: student, ordinary, benefactor, patron, corporate and institutional. The society hosts an annual convention. Members of the Society receive a quarterly newsletter AISBQ which includes short reports on current AI and Cognitive Science research. Members are also entitled to discounts to the ECAI conference.
