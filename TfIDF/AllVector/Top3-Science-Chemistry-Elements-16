A. James, L. O. Morgan, A. Ghiorso Discovery Location: Chicago Illinois United States Discovery Year: 1944 Name Origin: From America by analogy with europium. Abundance of Americium: Earth's Crust /p.p.m.: N/A Seawater /p.p.m.: nil Atmosphere /p.p.m.: N/A Sun (Relative to H=1E 12 ): N/A Sources of Americium: Produced by bombarding plutonium with neutrons. Total world production is probably around a few kilograms per year. Uses of Americium: In the past Americium was used as a source of radiation for radiography. Additional Notes: Americium is normally never encountered out side of the lab. It is extremely dangerous because of its intense alpha radiation.
