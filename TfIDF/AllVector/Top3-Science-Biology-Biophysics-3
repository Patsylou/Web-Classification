 SPR Pages Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a powerful technique to measure biomolecular interactions in real-time in a label free environment. While one of the interactants is immobilized to the sensor surface, the other are free in solution and passed over the surface. Association and dissociation is measured in arbitrary units and displayed in a graph called the sensorgram. read more ... NEW SPR PAGES WEBSITE GOTO www.sprpages.nl
