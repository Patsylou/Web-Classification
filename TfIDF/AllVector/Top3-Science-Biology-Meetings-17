 2010 Symposia Structure and Function of Neural Circuits Structure and Function of Neural Circuits EMBL Advanced Training Centre, Heidelberg, Germany Sunday 5 September - Wednesday 8 September 2010 Download Poster Understanding the complexity and functional composition of cellular and synaptic networks in the nervous system is a major challenge in neurobiology. Genes and molecules impact directly the assembly, function, and plasticity of specific neural circuits, and recent studies in different model systems start to elucidate the functionality of neuronal connectomes as an higher organisational entity required for the generation of complex behaviours. The goal of this Symposium is to highlight recent work on the anatomical and functional analysis of behaviourally-relevant neural circuits in genetically tractable model systems, and to promote the exchange of ideas and methods in this exciting field of research.
