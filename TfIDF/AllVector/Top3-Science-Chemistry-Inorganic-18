Churagulov . Group of Hydrothermal Synthesis is comprised of students of Materials Sciences and Chemistry Departments of the Moscow State University and graduate researchers. As a part of the Laboratory of Inorganic Materials Sciences, we are focused on the development of the soft processing approaches for the synthesis of various materials, e.g. simple oxides nanopowders, complex substances, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures, hybrids, nanocomposites, TOCs, HA, and so on. We invite you to read about the members of our group, visit the pages describing the fields of our research, and find out what papers we have written.
