Navigation handbook PDF The Camera: Master your camera’s features. Image Composition: Improve your ‘eye’ for image composition in the viewfinder. Image Enhancement: Master image processing software (Photoshop CS, Elements, Lightroom, Picasa, etc.) through our formal and informal workshops. Image Presentation: Tell a story through your images via digital projection, print, or multimedia. We all started as beginners and through activities like classes, programs, presentations, competitions, field trips, discussion topics, support groups, as well as the friendships that develop, we’ve enjoyed becoming more skilled in the art of photography. Visitors are always welcome. You are invited to join us at any of our regular monday night meetings, located at our building in Lynn, Massachusetts. Evening meetings are generally 7:30PM unless noted. For more information about our club please check out the About Us page. For directions to the club check out our interactive Directions page.
