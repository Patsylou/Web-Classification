 Mind Machine Museum a virtual museum and gallery of First in collection......the original control console for the first supercomputer, the CDC 6600....date: 1964 manufacturer: Control Data Corporation....serial number: 0002 designer: Seymour Cray....original cost of computer: $6 million Cray Research Supercomputing History Bayview Club photo of CDC 6600 C alculators, computers, and video games are all high-tech tools of the mind. Teachers may find students fascinated by early examples and willing to engage in high-tech archaeological "digs" in their local community. These artifacts, combined with their disks and cartridges, may be disassembled and analyzed, restored and displayed or operated as functioning units--an archaeological, technology challenge that gives students a historical perspective about the computer revolution, both its software and hardware. Traditional antiques are at least 100 years old, but given the rapid, unprecedented changes in microcomputers, game machines, and calculators, any such product that is 10 or more years old might be considered antique. This website is an attempt to create a web museum of many of these amazing artifacts of the twentieth century that I have owned. The following list provides links to illustrations to each model, original prices (when known), and basic specifications. Please note that most of this collection is located elsewhere, and, unfortunately, I no longer can answer inquiries about specific items. I am no longer collecting and have no additional information beyond what is listed. For further help, click here for links at the bottom of this page. .................... click on these options .................... ...computers....... .......calculators..... ...computer-related games.... ......related artifacts... computers  1955 GENIAC logic computer kit, 1st model (Berkeley Enterprises, Inc.)
