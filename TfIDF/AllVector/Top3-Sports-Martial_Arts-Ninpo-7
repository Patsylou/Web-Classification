 Bujinkan Ohoko Dojo East Home Bujinkan Ohoko Dojo East is located in the Charlotte area of North Carolina. It teaches the ancient art of Ninjutsu, the way of the Ninja. This is an original combat art, not the juvenile fluff portrayed on television and in the movies. It is a potent form of self-defense emphasizing balance, fluidity of movement, and an intimate knowledge of the human body's weak points. Ninjutsu can be learned by anyone, and can be practiced by people of all ages and physical condition. This is possible because Ninjutsu is the result of a thousand years of combat veterans teaching others the skills necessary for survival. If the techniques didn't work, people died. Any art that is dependent on youth, speed, and strength is doomed to fail as you grow older. If you are looking for something to enable you to survive almost anything, then this art may be the one you've been searching for. Training in the Bujinkan Ohoko Dojo East is currently headed by Dale Jackson (2nd Dan) and overseen by Shidoshi Frank Picarelli (6th Dan). We are also in affiliation with the original Bujinkan Ohoko Dojo in Orange, California, instructed by Shihan Ron Blackwood (13th Dan).
