 The Mizore Artificial Intelligence Project Download all the cool stuff here . Neuralsim What is this, and why should I care about it? This is the result of about two years of work by one person, me, Joseph Reisinger. Basically it is a neural network that attempts to mimic some biological form (instead of an abstract representation) and in the attempt perform more complex computation efficiently. What kind functions are you solving with this? Right now there is only one simulation that provides input. Its a really simple "world" with a "creature" and lights and blocks. The creature gains "energy" when it is on a light and loses it otherwise. Very typical optimization problem. Obviously the goal of this project is not to solve only one problem, but rather a large variety, so the neural network has been abstracted from world simulation. Thats all and good, but does it work? More or less, yes. I have evolved something close to the simplest solution to the lightseeker problem. I say "close to" because the neural network is rather stochastic as a single DNA set (almost) never will grow the same pattern twice. What work are you doing now? I've noticed that you haven't done much on this since like February. I've been searching for ways to reduce the stochasticity of the network. Mainly by allowing each individual neuron to set more parameters based on evolution rather than hard setting them at the beginning. The more variables that the DNA controls the better evolved the outcome is. Another reason I haven't been working on alice lately is because I've been laying the groundwork for kozue (like Kozue from Utena), which is more of a non-classical neural net program. It will use more cellular autonoma-like methods to grow neural structures. Its cool. Izumi This project is hosted by SourceForge, they're really cool people.
