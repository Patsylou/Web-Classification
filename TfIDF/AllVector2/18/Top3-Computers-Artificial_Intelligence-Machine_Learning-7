C shows the simplest case of logical inference made by PMM through using its knowledge. D , E and F demonstrate a variety of context recognition like missing/alternated words, omitted or inserted phrases, modified questions, etc. G shows the PMM behaviour in the case it doesn't have enough knowledge to response properly. H demonstrates the usage of the context for some kind of template creation. what's going on? looks like the local constabulary what's going on? what's going on? tailored to sensor nets General logic inference example About Us Andrew Borzenko 2004 - 2009 Undergraduate student at the University of Toronto 2009 B.Sc. in Computer Science, University of Toronto info@proto-mind.com sales@proto-mind.com PMM and Artificial General Intellect Select Publications [1] Associative Recognition of Signals by a Network of Formal Neurons
