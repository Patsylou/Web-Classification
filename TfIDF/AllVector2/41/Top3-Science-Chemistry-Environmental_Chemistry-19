Published online 11 December 2013 The development of electrochemical methods for determining nanoparticles in the environment. Part II. Chronoamperometric study of FeS in sodium chloride solutions Environmental context.  In anoxic environments FeS is both an important mediator in the Fe and S biogeochemical cycles and plays a vital role in controlling the scavenging and availability of many trace metals. Electrochemical detection of colloidal and particulate FeS in natural waters can be done by voltammetric measurements. The recorded anodic waves, however, are rather qualitative and lack information on the FeS concentration and size distribution. Abstract Published online 09 December 2013 The development of electrochemical methods for determining nanoparticles in the environment. Part I. Voltammetry and in-situ electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy (EC-STM) study of FeS in sodium chloride solutions Environmental context.  The dramatic change in physical and chemical characteristics that substances experience at reduced length scales (1–100 nm), together with a potential risk of ecotoxicity, are two of the reasons for the scientific interest in nanoparticles. The current understanding of the behaviour and fate of nanoparticles in natural waters is limited because of a lack of efficient methods for their characterisation. Electrochemistry is a promising tool for the determination and characterisation of nanoparticles in the natural environment. Abstract Published online 26 September 2013 Voltammetric characterisation of macroalgae-exuded organic ligands (L) in response to Cu and Zn: a source and stimuli for L Environmental context.  Identifying the source and stimuli responsible for organic ligands in seawater is crucial to understanding trace metal availability. Voltammetric techniques were employed to characterise the water chemistry of seaweed cultures exposed to low levels of Cu or Zn over 7 days. The results suggest that seaweeds are a potential source of metal complexing ligands and Cu and Zn appear to stimulate ligand production; further research is required to determine if this is applicable to macroalgae and metals outside this study. Abstract Supplementary Material (98 KB) Published online 20 September 2013 Deposition and dissolution of metal sulfide layers at the Hg electrode surface in seawater electrolyte conditions Environmental context.  The electrochemical detection of many sulfur compounds in natural waters is based on the deposition of a HgS layer at the Hg electrode. In samples containing metal ions in excess of sulfide species, electrochemical exchange reactions between the HgS and the metal ion produce metal-sulfide voltammetric peaks. These peaks can easily be misinterpreted as dissolved sulfide species, and hence do not reflect the bulk state of the solution. Abstract Environmental Chemistry Subscriber Login Hard X-ray synchrotron biogeochemistry: piecing together the increasingly detailed puzzle pp. 1-3 Scaling up: fulfilling the promise of X-ray microprobe for biogeochemical research pp. 4-9 Environmental context.  Although biogeochemical processes in the environment are often considered on large spatial scales, critical processes can occur at fine-spatial scales. Quantifying these processes is a challenge, but significant recent developments in microprobe X-ray absorption spectroscopy in terms of data collection and analysis greatly facilitate micro-scale observations at the sample-level. These mapping methods create datasets that can be integrated with bulk observations with the potential for widespread application to biogeochemical research. Abstract Visualising Fe speciation diversity in ocean particulate samples by micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy pp. 10-17 Environmental context.  Iron-bearing particles in the ocean have attracted interest due to the role of iron as an essential nutrient for microscopic algae, which form the base of the marine food chain. Modern techniques make it possible to analyse individual particles of iron to determine their composition, but the resulting flood of data can be overwhelming. We show a method of simplifying the data to answer such questions as what groups of minerals are present and whether they are different between ocean basins. Abstract | Full Text PDF (779 KB) Supplementary Material (4 MB) Effect of biogeochemical redox processes on the fate and transport of As and U at an abandoned uranium mine site: an X-ray absorption spectroscopy study pp. 18-27 Environmental context.  Uranium and arsenic, two elements of human health concern, are commonly found at sites of uranium mining, but little is known about processes influencing their environmental behaviour. Here we focus on understanding the chemical and physical processes controlling uranium and arsenic transport at an abandoned uranium mine. We find that the use of sedimentation ponds limits the mobility of uranium; however, pond conditions at our site resulted in arsenic mobilisation. Our findings will help optimise restoration strategies for mine tailings. Abstract Supplementary Material (788 KB) Synchrotron X-ray distinction of seasonal hydrological and temperature patterns in speleothem carbonate pp. 28-36 Environmental context.  Speleothem chemical records are used to reconstruct environmental change on a broad range of timescales. However, one of the biggest challenges is to link the records contained within speleothems at the sub-annual timescale to changing meteorological conditions. Seasonal infiltration patterns and cave ventilation dynamics are reconstructed through high resolution analysis of speleothem trace element content by synchrotron radiation, building towards proxy records of hydrological variability and winter duration as indices of recent climatic change beyond the instrumental period. Abstract Supplementary Material (239 KB) Environmental chemistry: a discipline standing on two shoulders pp. 37-40 Diffusion limitation of zinc fluxes into wheat roots, PLM and DGT devices in the presence of organic ligands pp. 41-50 Environmental context.  Zinc is an essential micronutrient for plants and many arid areas of the world have zinc-deficient soils. The bioavailability of Zn to plants is influenced by diffusion limitations and complex lability in the soil solution. To identify the relative importance of these two factors, we investigated the influence of diffusion layer thickness on Zn uptake by wheat and by two bio-mimetic devices in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and two natural ligands found in soil. Abstract Supplementary Material (469 KB) Photolysis and TiO 2 -catalysed degradation of diclofenac in surface and drinking water using circulating batch photoreactors pp. 51-62 Environmental context.  Diclofenac, a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is not completely removed from surface and drinking water by conventional treatment methods. Consequently, this drug is present in the aquatic environment and has been subsequently linked to toxic effects on organisms. We show that photolysis and TiO 2 -catalysed degradation in circulating batch reactors efficiently results in diclofenac removal under a variety of conditions. These photochemical methods thus may lead to more effective water treatment processes. Abstract 2 A method to determine silver partitioning and lability in soils pp. 63-71 Environmental context.  Soils contaminated with silver can have detrimental environmental effects because of silver’s toxicity to a range of soil-dwelling organisms. The total concentration of silver in soil, however, is often not a good indicator of potential toxicity as it does not account for variations in bioavailability. We report a method for soil analysis that measures the amount of silver available for uptake by soil-dwelling organisms, and hence could provide data that better reflect potential toxicity. Abstract Supplementary Material (221 KB) Solid phase microextraction speciation analysis of triclosan in aqueous media containing sorbing nanoparticles pp. 72-76 Environmental context.  Speciation analysis of organic compounds in aquatic media is often performed using solid phase microextraction with the assumption that only the free organic form is accumulated. We show that in the presence of silica nanoparticles, this interpretation is confounded by partitioning of nanoparticulate-bound compounds between water and the solid phase, as well as their aggregation at solid–bulk medium interfaces. Equilibrium measurement of the target analyte is feasible if the solid phase is protected by a suitable membrane. Abstract Australian carbon tetrachloride emissions in a global context pp. 77-88 Environmental context.  Carbon tetrachloride in the background atmosphere is a significant environmental concern, responsible for ~10 % of observed stratospheric ozone depletion. Atmospheric concentrations of CCl 4 are higher than expected from currently identified emission sources: largely residual emissions from production, transport and use. Additional sources are required to balance the expected atmospheric destruction of CCl 4 and may contribute to a slower-than-expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone ‘hole’.
