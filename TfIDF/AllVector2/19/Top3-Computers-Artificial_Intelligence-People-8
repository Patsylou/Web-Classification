The ultimate aim is to develop improved command and control capabilities, primarily in the defence environment but not only here. Our particular strength lies in our ability, in concert with others, to take an overall perspective in the development of support tools for command and control and for decision-making processes in complex environments. Our customers include the Swedish Armed Forces and the EU but also Vinnova and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The research is conducted mainly in two main areas: Decision support, knowledge management and information fusion, and Simulation and Distributed Systems Share this page: Contact Lars Lindberg Head of Department FOI, Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI Swedish Defence Research Agency SE-164 90 Stockholm Phone +46 8 555 030 00 Fax +46 8 555 031 00 Follow us in social media About the website About cookies Locations Grindsjön Stockholm (Kista) Linköping Umeå
