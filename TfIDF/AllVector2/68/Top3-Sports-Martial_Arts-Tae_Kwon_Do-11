Details http://en.mastaekwondo.com/2014/02/fake-sensing-socks-what-happens-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas/ The piece is critical of the US Open and USAT on this issue. Their points are valid. However, I have been told that there were two cases of Russian competitors, and that supposedly the CEO informed the delegation any further discoveries would see the whole delegation disqualified. If true, then maybe he didn't go as far as mastaekwondo would have liked, but went farther than the article implies. Details I have not been keeping up on all the info from the US Open. Next year, I think I will get the flu shot. Word is a couple of late nights. Word is a couple of Russian competitors had altered socks and their delegation was told if another tu rns up the whole delegation gets dq'd. I hear that today the Denmark scoring system has been scrapped and they went back to the old system. For the first time in recent history, Steven Lopez competed at the US Open. http://www2.teamusa.org/USA-Taekwondo/Features/2014/February/17/Open-for-business Details http://www2.teamusa.org/USA-Taekwondo/Features/2014/February/20/Governance-Committee-Bylaw-review The USA Taekwondo Governance Committee is conducting a review of the USAT Bylaws, not for a complete rewrite, but to correct any typos and make any important/critical changes. We welcome any input from the membership on potential revisions we should consider, and respectfully request those be submitted to Don Reynolds at Â by the end of the day on Friday, Feb. 28, 2014. My first suggestion would be the committee start following the bylaws and notice meetings and put out minutes. It is hypocritical for the committee charged with reviewing the bylaws not to follow them. Start Prev 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Next End Joomla!
