 NHRF Home Location Contact Greek INSTITUTE OF BIOLOGY, MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY & BIOTECHNOLOGY Ι.Β.Μ.C.B About Research Infrastructure & Services Publications Personnel News Links Contact The Division of Organic & Medicinal Chemistry (OMC) The Division was intially established in 1979 as the Centre of Organic Chemistry, one of the six research units of the National Hellenic Research Foundation. Later, the Institute's research activities were extended to the field of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and in 1989 it was renamed the Institute of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry (IOPC), until 2012 when it was merged with the former Institute of Biological Research and Biotechnology into the Institute of Biology, Medicinal Chemistry and Biotechnology. Activities i ) cutting edge basic research focusing on the design , synthesis and analysis of new compounds with potential applications in: The integrated approach of the Division of Organic Medicinal Chemistry (OMC) for the development of the above-mentioned compounds includes theoretical studies and experimental procedures which are supported by state-of-the-art equipment, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Mass Spectra spectrometers, an  X-ray system for protein crystallography and cluster computational systems . ii) the development of specialised applications of   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the field of food chemistry iii) the training of young scientists at undergraduate, post-graduate and post-doctoral iv) the transfer of knowledge and provision of specialised services to third parties (Research and Technology Institutes, Universities, Industry at both national and international level). The IOPC has three specialised units for the provision of services Personnel The permanent research staff of the OMC is distributed among five research groups Achievements The OMC's cutting edge research is demonstrated in a large number of publications in peer-reviewed international scientific journals as well as in Greek and international patents Funding The OMC's excellence in research has been recognised by the European Community and by the General Secretariat of Research and Technology of Greece. During the last 5 years,OMC has been awarded funding of 9 Μ for National and European competitive projects. Collaborations
