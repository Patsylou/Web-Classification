The first painting titled, “Vaya con Dios”, is a heartfelt goodbye of a woman blowing a kiss to her beloved. The half-painted face symbolizes the present and past relationship one has to someone who is no longer part of their life. While a departed loved one may no longer be with us physically, their spirit lives on in our memory and consciousness. A friend gave me the rounded top, rough hewn frame that made it a perfect match for the image I painted. The artwork was exhibited at Avenue 50 gallery in Highland Park, CA. The second painting titled, “Mariachi Amor”, is more of a poster design with some serenading mariachis ascending from a tombstone. They are celebrating and rejoicing as they commemorate a loved one who shared happy times with family and friends when they were in this world. The artwork was exhibited at KGB Studio and gallery in Los Angeles, CA. 1977-2012 Joe Bravo. All rights reserved.
