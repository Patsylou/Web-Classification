 Wright Group University of St Andrews , Scotland Home P. A. Wright Research Group Links Contact Welcome to the Wright Group The research carried out in the group concerns the rational design of novel solids for use as shape-selective sorbents and catalysts. Materials of interest include microporous zeolites, aluminophosphates, aluminophosphonates, inorganic-organic hybrids and mesoporous silicas. Additional functionallity may be conferred on these materials by intoduducing modifications to, for example, the pore walls or by the addition of metal cations or by the incorporation of organic moeties (such as enzymes or metal complexes) into the framework/pores during or after synthesis. Catalytic and sorption properties can then studied and evaluated. Further details may be found by accessing specific group members pages. Paul A. Wright Paul A. Wright is Professor of Chemistry of Chemistry at the University of St Andrews. Since he joined the faculty, he had a thriving group since then, which is reflected by a wide range of publications. Meet Paul A. Wright Research Areas covered by this group range from metal-organic frameworks all the way to zeolites and zeotypes. The general interest lies in porous materials for a range of applications such as gas storage, catalysis or seperation processes.
