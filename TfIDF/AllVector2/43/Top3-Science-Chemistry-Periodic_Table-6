F. Collier, p17. Henry Moseley, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 26, 1913, p1030. The Periodic Table Author: Dr. Doug Stewart The periodic table we use today is based on the one devised and published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev found he could arrange the 65 elements then known in a grid or table so that each element had: 1. A higher atomic weight than the one on its left. For example, magnesium (atomic weight 24.3) is placed to the right of sodium (atomic weight 23.0): 23.0 Na 24.3 Mg 9.01 Be 24.3 Mg 40.1 Ca 87.6 Sr Mendeleev realized that the table in front of him lay at the very heart of chemistry. And more than that, Mendeleev saw that his table was incomplete - there were spaces where elements should be, but no-one had discovered them.  Just as Adams and Le Verrier could be said to have discovered the planet Neptune on paper, Mendeleev could be said to have discovered germanium on paper. He called this new element eka-silicon , after observing a gap in the periodic table between silicon and tin: 28.1 Si ?? ?? 119 Sn Similarly, Mendeleev discovered gallium ( eka -aluminum) and scandium ( eka -boron) on paper, because he predicted their existence and their properties before their actual discoveries.
