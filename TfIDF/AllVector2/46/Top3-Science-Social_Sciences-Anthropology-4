It is administered through Academic Affairs and housed on the UMSL south campus. The Department of Anthropology, Sociology and Language provides additional expertise in understanding human origin and cultural diversity; the College of Education provides expertise in developing pedagogy and designing curriculum for elementary through high school levels. Building on the 21st Century COE and foundations of anthropological knowledge, the program has designed a 4-12 grade curriculum as well pre-service and in-service teacher instruction guides. CHOCD has been selected by museums and exhibit coordinators to develop and execute both staff and public educational training.
