The Eye Our ability to see is the result of a process similar to that of a camera. In a camera, light passes through a series of lenses that focus images onto film or an imaging chip. The eye performs a similar function in that light passes through the cornea and crystalline lens, which together focus images onto the retinathe layer of light sensing cells that lines the back of the eye. 2008 Optobionics, All Rights Reserved
