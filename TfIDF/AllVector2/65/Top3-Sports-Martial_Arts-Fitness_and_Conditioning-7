ORDER YOUR COPY NOW! SEE and HEAR the past and present masters of the speed bag. You will not believe how long this has been around, or how many people have loved it! "The Art of the Bag... A Speed Bag Story" was envisioned, produced and directed by Joe Saba, who started out a few years ago as a guy mesmerized by the sound and fury of the speed bag, and through many hours under the board became a bagger of master level skills, while beautifully capturing the heart and soul of the bag and a small but growing cadre of speed bag fanatics who gather yearly to share their skills and learn from each other. Joe spent over two years and many thousands of his own dollars producing this film for the soul purpose of honoring the Speed Bag and those that use it. Thanks JOE!
