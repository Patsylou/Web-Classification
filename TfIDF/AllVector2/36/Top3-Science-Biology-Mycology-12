  photo by Maggie Whitson, Duke University M ushrooms  of N orth C arolina (1995)   The fungi shown on these pages may be found in the forests of central and coastal North Carolina. The photos and collections were made during the fall of 1995 as part of a class assignment for Introductory Mycology (Bot 220, taught by R. Vilgalys) at Duke University. Students were required to prepare a collection of 50 specimens representing a cross section of mushroom diversity from North Carolina, with notes and photos. The best student photos were selected for this homepage. Many of the specimens shown on these photos were collected during field trips to several interesting habitats in North Carolina, including the piedmont, sandhills, and coastal forest regions.
