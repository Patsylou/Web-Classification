Custom Solutions Our company grew out of solving research problems, how can we help you? Life Science Applications Our solutions are used in labs around the world, whats your application? Our Products We manufacture life science products for research and molecular diagnostics. Partner Research Corner Pioneer in high throughput biomarker discovery Antigen Discovery Inc.’s protein microarrays allow for highly multiplexed assays the generate hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands data points for each sample tested. Antigen Discovery Inc., our collaborators and our customers have leveraged this technology to peer into the complex intricacies of the immune response to disease generating over 80 peer-reviewed research articles in various fields that include, but are not limited to the Malaria filed with our P. falciparum and P. vivax protein microarrays, Tuberculosis with our whole proteome M. tuberculosis microarrays and human autoimmune diseases with our human protein microarray including proteins associated with various autoimmune diseases. Antigen Discovery Inc. is a pioneer in high throughput biomarker discovery. Their unique approach alleviates the bottleneck in the discovery of novel targets for the development of diagnostic products, therapeutics and vaccine candidates. Antigen Discovery has leveraged the information available from the multitude of sequencing projects to create the world’s largest pathogen clone collection, and a targeted human clone collection. The clone collection can be used to make whole and partial proteome protein microarrays for over 30 human pathogens as well as human protein microarrays. The protein microarrays can then be used to profile the immune response to infection, vaccination, autoimmunity and cancer. Read More Grace Research Corner A Systems Approach to Quantitave Multiplexed RPPA Presented by: Michael A. Shultz, PhD RPPA Workshop in Kobe, Japan November, 2013 Porous nitrocellulose film (PNC) is the substrate of choice for RPPA largely because of its extraordinarily high protein binding capacity, which can exceed non-porous planar counterparts by 500X. Spotting, assay, and analyte preservation reagents developed specifically for PNC-based microarrays contribute needed sensitivity and accuracy to RPPA assays. An additional property of PNC, which we call Resonance Scattering Amplification (RSA), when properly employed can increase dynamic range of RPPA by two orders of magnitude. Fluorescent has advantages over colorimetric signal development for quantitative RPPA applications. PNC autofluorescence, relatively high at visible wavelengths, is non-existent at NIR wavelengths, so that assay backgrounds are equivalent to clear glass.
