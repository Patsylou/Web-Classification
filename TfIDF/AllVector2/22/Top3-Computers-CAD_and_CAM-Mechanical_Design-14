The most comprehensive piping analysis software for 20 years in small to high-end piping projects worldwide for the power, oil and gas, petrochemical, offshore, and nuclear markets. Faster engineered piping systems backed by nuclear Quality Assurance to ISO 9001. Product Data Sheet Product Tour Video Gallery AutoPIPE provides a comprehensive and advanced software tool specialized in pipe stress analysis.The intuitive modeling environment and the advanced analysis features provide for increased productivity and improved quality control.Fluent data collaboration can be obtained through the integration with structural and 3D models, providing an environment for increased business growth. AutoPIPE provides comprehensive designincluding advanced analysis features such asintegrated through wall thermal gradient, fluid transient, thermal bowing or stratification, seismic response spectra enveloping, and steam relief analyses for process, power, oiland gas, nuclear, underground, offshore FPSO platform, and subsea pipeline areas.Nuclear approved softwareallows users to design Class 1, 2, and 3 nuclear piping systems. Approvals includestandards as10CFR Part 50, 10CFR 21, and ASME NQA-1-2008/2009a. AutoPIPE was developed as a scalable offering to meet the needs of companies working in industries like nuclearand fossil power, process and chemical plants, offshore FPSO platform and riser design, fire protection systems, oil refineries, cross-country gas and oil pipelines, FRP piping, and building services piping. AutoPIPE now incorporates ASME, British, European, German, Japanese, Chinese, API, NEMA, ANSI, ASCE, AISC, UBC, ISO, and WRC guidelines and design limits. AutoPIPE offers unparalleled integration to all major intelligent 3D CAD systems like AutoPLANT , PlantSpace, Intergraph PDS, and Aveva PDMS. Automated intelligent stress isometrics can be easily generated and customized. Anyone on the project team canmake early design decisions, view full modeland graphical data, and perform automatic clash detection of both AutoPIPE and CAD models side by side with ProjectWise Navigator .AutoPIPE Plus now includes AutoPIPE Nozzle under the new name AutoPIPE Advanced. AutoPIPE featuresthe only piping and structural analysis integrationsolution with STAAD.Pro on the market today.Create a structural model in STAAD.Pro, move it into Bentley AutoPIPE for more realistic integrated piping and structural analysis, then transfer the final piping model complete with pipe support loads to the Bentley STAAD model in minutestrue "round-tripping" of structural and piping information! Bentley AutoPIPE enables users to create, modify, and review piping and structural models and their results quickly and easily while offering advanced linear and non-linear analysis capabilities under static and dynamic conditions like temperature, wind, wave, buoyancy, seismic, and transient loadings.
