Optimization Leader Profiles Altair Aras CD-adapco CST ETA ESTECO IronCAD RTT Tormach From own to rent, from all-in-one to pick-what-you-want -- modular software and rental programs emerge to address the needs of activist-inventors. by Kenneth Wong A t age three, David Hutton decided he wanted to be an inventor. At 13, he began designing a water pump based on what hed learned in a physics lesson. Dreaming big, he imagined his device would solve the irrigation problems of the Third World. It wasnt smooth sailing for the budding engineer, however. As it turned out, my designwas technically impossible, he recalls. Subsequent research highlighted the flaws of pumps in the developing world, from lack of maintenance to unavailability of replacement parts. Build It, and They Will Come by Pamela J.
