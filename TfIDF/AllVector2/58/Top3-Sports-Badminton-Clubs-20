We have in Cooroy a thriving badminton community that meets several days per week for social and competitive play. We are fortunate enough to have our own badminton stadium with 3 dedicated courts. Cooroy is situated some 10 kms west of Noosa, or 140 North of Brisbane, Queensland. The courts are located at the end of Emerald Street.   We are always on the lookout for new members. Badminton is the fastest racket sport in the world , which is lots of fun to play. It is easy to learn a basic skill level, so that you can take part in social play and more competitive team play. We have members from 7 years old up to 82. We have players of all abilities. We are all friendly people, so why don't you visit us and give badminton a go?   Social Play There is social badminton on Wednesday, from 9:30am until 11:30am. This is very informal - just show up and we will match you up with some evenly matched players. We even have a coffee or tea break in between. Costs: $5/adult, $4/junior. In addition there is social badminton on Wednesday and Friday nights from 7:30pm until 9:30pm, for all of you who can't make it during daytime. This is an ideal opportunity to try out some new fancy shots or have a game of singles: $5/person.   Juniors On Saturday afternoons, from 2:30pm until 4:30pm, there is a juniors session, with kids of primary and high school age. During this session we are organising some basic training routines as well as fun games.   Coaching We are very fortunate to have a QBA qualified trainer/coach in the person of Greg O'Neil. Greg conducts coaching sessions on Wednesday nights from 5:30 - 7:00pm and Friday nights from 6:00 - 7:30pm. The training is very thorough with a half hour to warm up and stretch followed by a good hour for foot- and racket work. Greg has already coached several players  to state and national championships.
