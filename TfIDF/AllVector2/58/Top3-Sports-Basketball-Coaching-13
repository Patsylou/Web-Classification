 Basketball is my LIFE How do you go from where you are to where you want to be? I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You have to have a dream, a goal, and you have to be willing to work for it. - Jim Valvano (R.I.P. March 10, 1946 - April 28, 1993 About Me Coaching Resume Education Relevant Experience Files Contact Me About Me Well this is a site all about Anton Warnica (me). A recent graduate of Durham College's Sport Management Program. This site is all about my history with basketball where I've coached articles written as well as some basic sample files I've given out to players to help them with their game over the summer. Ever since I picked up a ball and played in the driveway I fell in love with the game of basketball. I wanted to play all the time and it was a good thing because as a kid growing up in Canada we couldn't afford to play our national past-time hockey. I played basketball all the time, summer, spring fall and yes even in the winter with snow on the ground and gloves on. I first started to coach at 14 and I enjoyed it, not as much as playing but it was fulfilling. Little did I know that it would be a foreshadowing into my future. In my last year of high school my shot was off and I noticed that I had some shoulder pain. I went to see some sports specialists and they had no idea so I tried physio for almost a year without any major changes. During my rehab I also injured my ankle, it wasn't broken or sprained but there was clearly pain and that also set me back. I took some time off from basketball to work full-time and after a while I tried to train again but my body couldn't take it and I hung up my shoes and threw away any chance of having a College career. Both still bother me to this day but the pain is manageable and I can hit the hardwood occasionally. So one door closes another one opens right? Well, I think so and I want to make coaching my profession. Â© Anton Warnica 2008 Create a Free Website
