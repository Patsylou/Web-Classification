 "viagra bestellen, viagra ohne rezept viagra rezeptfrei , viagra kaufen, viagra generikum" Badminton is one of the few sports where men and women play together. It is a game for all ages and abilities, and although fitness is a key aspect for professional players, it is not a prerequisite for taking up the sport. These factors make it the ideal sport for families and friends of all walks of life to play together. It can also be a wonderful way to meet new friends through local clubs and sports centres. After s0ccer, badminton is the world's most popular sport (I read this somewhere. I can't validate this claim, but... I'll go along with it!). It is most popular in south-east Asia, where many children learn to play badminton at school.It is also the fastest racket sport in the world - the shuttle reach speeds in excess of 200km/hr. It's a fantastic sport, why not give it a try - one billion people can't be wrong! For information on where you can play locally you should contact your national badminton association.
