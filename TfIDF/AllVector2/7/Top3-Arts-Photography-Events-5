 Home About Map Fringe Festival line-up Press Projects Events Friends Links We would like to thank our audience and sadly confirm that due to funding cutbacks there will not be a festival in 2012 and that the festival team were made redundant in January 2012. We would like to thank Caitlin, Jaime and Cai as well as Kirsty and Kerry our interns for producing what was acclaimed as two of the best of our 21 years of festivals and wish them well in their future work. HPF are delighted to announce that Simon Bainbridge, editor of The British Journal of Photography will curate the exhibition at Hereford Museum and Art Gallery this year. Time Motion Studies presents the works of five photographers, each the result of deliberate and sustained observation. But more than that, each employs a carefully thought-out strategy for their study, a methodology by which to transcribe and communicate ideas about the world, tackling subjects that aren’t always obviously photogenic. For the photographers in the exhibition, the ideas they are trying to communicate take prescience over aesthetic concerns, although these remain important, both in terms of engaging viewers and in contributing to the development of a wider photographic language. Photographers include Vanessa Winship, George Georgiou, Donald Weber, Robbie Cooper and Manuel Vasquez Simon said: “I was thrilled to be approached by Hereford Photography Festival who have such a great history of exhibiting international photographic work. I’m excited to be working with them in this their twenty-first year, on an exhibition that will respond to the idea of movement; this year’s festival theme. Work will focus on the strategies contemporary photographers employ to capture everyday life as it passes across their frame and photographers will be selected from the UK and throughout the world.” photograph: Vanessa Winship There is now no office support for the festival we are sorry if you have tried to make contact and have not had a reply Become a friend of HPF See Festival Programme HPF Seminar Feel free to Contact us Latest News - New stock and event photography website -Map of Hereford Venues - HPF RM Shoot-Out Film on our HCA Young persons photo comp Social Links Flickr - Hereford Photography Festival 2010 2009 Home About Join Friends Open Here Projects Opportunities Mailing List Education Links Facebook Twitter Flickr Contact enquiries@photofest.org Design by www.lukedesign.co.uk Website by www.infinityunlimited.co.uk
