Happy Chinese New Year To All! Bryan Peterson Talk   “The World Is Your Studio” Are you lacking in creative thought and vision? Do you often come back ‘empty-handed’ after spending a whole day out shooting? Do you struggle with not knowing what lens to use? Do you know where to find the most compelling point of view? Do you often crop your photos AFTER you shoot in order to salvage something good from your efforts? Do you have some great ideas but then fail miserably in trying to execute these ideas? Utilizing a number of eye-catching and thought provoking imagery this presentation will take you on a remarkable and revealing journey towards the psychology of ‘seeing’. Of course most of us can see in the conventional sense, but most of us don’t ‘see’ in the creative sense because, quite simply, we are blind to it. This presentation will open your eyes to the vast and inspiring world of the elements of design and their emotional messages. These very elements are at the root of artistic vision and opening your eyes to them will unleash a level of perception of the world around in ways you had never before imagined. A thorough exploration of lens choice and point of view, two additional and very important elements in succeeding at ‘seeing creatively’ are also discussed in depth, including the how, when and why a given lens and point of view ARE the ONLY combination for a given idea. And finally, a discussion on the creative use of electronic flash that is guaranteed to both shock and surprise you at not just how easy it is to employ but also showing you ideas where flash was used perhaps in ways that you never thought of before. Based in part on Bryan’s latest book EXPOSURE SOLUTIONS, this presentation will challenge you mentally as well as visually. As Henry David Thoreau once said, “The question is not what you look at but what you see.” If you are not ‘seeing’ the perfect picture each and every time than this presentation promises to open your eyes, perhaps in ways you’ve never experienced before.
