 Mike Attwood - Photographer MENU Wildlife Red Kites Athletes Sales News Contact Home Site Map Mikes interest in photography began at a very early age when as war evacuee he had the good fortune to be billeted in the household of an excellent photographer. The interest gained and knowledge absorbed lay dormant for many years until at an age where some men are considering retirement it was reborn. In 2000 awarded a distinction by the Royal Photographic Society for his portfolio on disabled athletes. Having been a keen ornithologist since his evacuee days now combines his photography with his love of birds, especially raptors. The Welsh Red Kite is now top of his list spending as much time as he can at Gigrin Farm where the Red Kite can be found in large numbers. This year (2002) he was fortunate to get the opportunity to photograph kites at the nest, an opportunity gratefully taken, hopefully the results leading to more work of this nature.
