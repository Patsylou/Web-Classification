Although the Gallery began actively acquiring photographs in 1989, the collection initially consisted primarily of the art of a few key twentieth-century American photographers: Alfred Stieglitz , Paul Strand , Ansel Adams , Walker Evans , Robert Frank , and Harry Callahan . Since 1995 the museum has been adding photographs from a much broader spectrum and now has more than 9,000 nineteenth- and twentieth-century photographs in the collection, by more than 250 European and American photographers. This tour, drawn entirely from the Gallery's collection and from promised gifts, celebrates some of those recent additions, including works by pioneer photographer William Henry Fox Talbot , celebrated nineteenth-century master Julia Margaret Cameron , modernist artists such as Charles Sheeler and L Moholy-Nagy , as well as such observers of modern life as Bill Brandt .
