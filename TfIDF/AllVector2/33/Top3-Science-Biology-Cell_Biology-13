Go Mitochondria I want you...to visit our site everyday! here is a photo of us New Comments This is a really great and informative site. This is the best site I have been to in a long time. I think David and Eugene's Teacher should give them an A. We can not even compare our site to David and Eugene's. You see, our site is a bunch of pictures, with no effort at all, while David and Eugene's site consists of the most effort we have ever seen. One day, I hope to get our site at least half as good as David and Eugene's site. Roman Lopez and Jeff M. If you know what is good for you, you will sign my guest book.
