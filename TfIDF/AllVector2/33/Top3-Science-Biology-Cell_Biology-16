But what did he see in the transparent water? He saw his own image beneath him, no longer that of an ugly, dirty grey duckling, but that of a majestic swan. There’s no harm in being born in a farmyard when you hatch from a swan’s egg. Hans Christian Andersen, The Ugly Duckling The history of p53 is a chaotic voyage from the world of oncogenes to the world of tumour suppressor genes, while retaining a certain degree of individuality. Apart from artefactual problems related to involuntary cloning of mutant p53, this ambiguity is also due to our propensity to over-categorize in order to satisfy our Cartesian and oversimplistic view of science .
