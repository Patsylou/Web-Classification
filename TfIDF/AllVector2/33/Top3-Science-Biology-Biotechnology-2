The methods will be subjected to rigorous testing in order to meet international validation standards and to be accepted by industrial users and regulatory authorities. Project duration: From 01 Jan 2007 to 31 Dec 2009. Project coordinated by University of Oslo, Prof. Andrew Collins. Project funded by the 6th Framework Programme from the European Commission.
