 CellProgram (Toronto) Main Main 1. Topological approach to cell division in tissues How do the cells divide in the organism? Ref. 1 2. Properties of the crypt of intestinal epithelium Photo 1. Intestinal epithelium separated from the underlying tissue. The villi are seen as "caps". Photo 2. View from the crypts' side. "Caps" are seen from the inside. Photo 3. A row of the villi connected by crypts is stretched by two needles. Photo 4. Two villi with some crypts Photos 5, 6. Left - a crypt with its nuclei stained. Right - the same crypt, focus on the dividing nuclei (darker bodies) near the crypt axis. Photo 7. Surface of the epithelium of the villis. A schematic view of the section made along the crypt axis. Continuous row of cells going to the villi is shown. Ref. 1 3. Topological presumptions in the program Ref. 1 The division wave. Initiation of the division wave. Ref. 1 References: Pyshnov, M.
