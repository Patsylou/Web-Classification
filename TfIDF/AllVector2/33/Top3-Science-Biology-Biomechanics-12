Welcome Welcome to the web site of the American Society of Biomechanics! Biomechanics represents the broad interplay between mechanics and biological systems. The American Society of Biomechanics (ASB) was founded in 1977 to encourage and foster the exchange of information and ideas among biomechanists working in different disciplines and to facilitate the development of biomechanics as a basic and applied science. ASB has a membership of approximately 600 academic researchers, clinicians, scientists, students, and industry members working to solve basic and applied problems in the realm of biomechanics and to improve understanding of the workings of biological systems. ASB members are organized into five primary discipline categories: biological sciences, exercise and sports science, health sciences, ergonomics and human factors, and engineering and applied science. Mission of the ASB: Special Thanks to our ASB Corporate Sponsors Supporting Member Partner Member Information Desk The 38th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Biomechanics (ASB) will be held in conjunction with the 7th World Congress of Biomechanics (WCB) in Boston, Massachusetts from July 6-11, 2014 Graduate Programs in Biomechanics Videos of the Month ASB Fellows ASB Code of Conduct ASB Conversations on Twitter Tweets by @AmSocBiomech For any questions about this website, please contact the ASB Communications Chair.
