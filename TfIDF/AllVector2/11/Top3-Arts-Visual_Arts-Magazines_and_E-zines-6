Works from over two centuries provide an insightful historical perspective of the polar regions over that time, and show how that viewpoint has shifted in the face of climate change. Examples of pristine alpine landscapes and renditions of glacial areas from the late 18th century onward capture the sublime beauty of icy environments around the world. Illustrations from early voyages and expeditions are particularly powerful when juxtaposed with recent images that reveal rapidly retreating ice. Nineteenth-century paintings show elegant glaciers in traditionally painted landscapes (by, for example, William Bradford and Albert Beirstadt). Several paintings from the 1930s offer a more stylized vision of frozen environments in Tibets Himalayas, Alaskas Resurrection Bay and elsewhere. In contrast, the concerns of modern and contemporary artists highlight the reality of these changing regions. Satirical works function as social commentary, such as Alexis Rockmans 2008 oil painting of Adelie penguins atop a huge block of melting ice, and Jyoti Duwadis art-ice installation for the museums grounds that was left to melt naturally. Other contemporary pieces offer a majestic perspective on the magnitude of Earth. A notable example: Lita Albuquerques 2006 installation Stellar Axis (photographed by Jean de Pomereu), in which the artist transformed a stark white icefield in Antarctica by placing 99 blue spheres in perfect alignment with constellations above. whatcommuseum.org Allyn Cantor Len Jenshel , Narsaq Sound, Greenland (2001), C-print [Whatcom Museum, Bellingham WA, Nov 3-Mar 16] Courtesy of the artist and Joseph Bellows Gallery, La Jolla, California Christian Houge , Winternight (2001), digital C-print [Whatcom Museum, Bellingham WA, Nov 3-Mar 16] Courtesy of the artist and Hosfelt Gallery, San Francisco and New York Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey , Ice Lens, Svalbard Archipelago (2005), archival inkjet print [Whatcom Museum, Bellingham WA, Nov 3-Mar 16] Courtesy of the artists FEATURES, NEW OLD: Kingston Prize | Charles Edenshaw | Jillian McDonald | William Perehudoff | Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Gainsborough:The Treasures of Kenwood House, London | Carrying on Irregardless | Elles: Women Artists from the Centre Pompidou | James Nizam: Trace Heavens | Gaugin Polynesia | Leslie Dill's Poetic Vision | Preview's 25th Anniversary in Print | The Surrealist Revolution in Art | Carl Beam | Shadows of a Fleeting World: Seattle Camera Club | Picasso: Masterpieces from the Muse National, Paris | Show of Hands: Northwest Women Artists 1880-2010 | Fleeting Beauty: Japanese Woodblock Prints | Judy Radul: World Rehearsal Court | Requiem: BY Photographers Who Died in Vietnam Indochina | Andreas Gurksy: Werke/Works 80-08 | Chris Jordan: Running the Numbers II | Action-Camera: Beijing Performance Photography | Hiro Yamagata: T R A N S I E N T | Henk Pander: History and Typography | Mandy Greer: Dare alla Luce | Generation: Images of Youth | Rembrandt Dutch Art's Golden Age | Seattle Art Museum at 75 | Life After Death: New Leipzig Paintings | Joanna Staniszkis: Silk City | Rodin: In His Own Words | First Nations Art: Historic to Contemporary | Maya Lin: Systematic Landscapes | Three Rivers: Wild Waters, Sacred Places | Portland Art Museum | Acting Out: Claude Cahun Marcel Moore | Isamu Noguchi: Sculptural Design | Rhythm and Change: The Bow in Contemporary Art | Douglas Curran: The Elephant Has Four Hearts | Fay Jones: Recent Paintings | Massive Change: Bruce Mau | Web Images: Quick Guide | Treasures From the Krller | Gerry Deiter: Give Peace a Chance | InFest: International Artist-Run Culture | Silver: Dreams, Screens Theories | Paul Wong: COLLECT | James Turrell: Knowing Light | Joanna Staniszkis: Linens Edge | Daniel Joliffe/Jocelyn Robert: Ground Station | Bratsa Bonifacho: Habitat Pixel | Edouardo Kac: Contemporary Art Explores Human Genomics | Douglas Gordon at the VAG | Walk Ways Explore Body-Mind Connection Preview in Print The print edition of Preview gives more details of galleries and exhibitions.
