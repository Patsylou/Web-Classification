I create a TrueType font using TypeTool 3 (with a little help from my CINTIQ pen and Adobe Illustrator). I like to make my own fonts from scratch. If you prefer to pick a font lovingly designed by a professional designer, TypeKit.com is very easy to use. I submit this file to fontsquirrel.com s web font generator. It generates a zip file with ttf, woff, eot, svg, a CSS file, and a demo file. In this zip file is a snippet of code that looks like this: I copy the font files (the contents of the zip) to my web server. I copy the block of code above to my CSS file and modify it accordingly to point to where the fonts reside on my web server. I may have to adjust file permissions to make sure everything works. I then can use the font by adding the property anywhere in my stylesheet. Previous About Kristen Coder, maker, artist, dreamer. Contact me if you want an image for your commercial project.
