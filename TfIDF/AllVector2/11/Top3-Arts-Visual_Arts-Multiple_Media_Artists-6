Pages Home 1000Woodcuts.com Bookstore Links About the Artist Contact Friday, February 7, 2014 Puzzle Prints about to get a SOLO Puzzle Print #1 The Great Cairn! Sahara West Library used to be the Las Vegas Art Museum and the venue, in the heart of West Las Vegas,could not be better for showing art! Address is Las Vegas, Nevada Nevada Arts Council . Although many artists shy away from applying for grants and other available resources, I highly encourage the practice. Exhibits are expensive and often the venues don't yield a bunch of money for the artist, although the recognition gained is priceless. This project is funded, in part, by a grant from the Nevada Arts Council, a state agency, and the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal agency. Maria Arango Diener 11:31 AM Email This BlogThis!

Block "locked" side to side and end to end runners perpendicular to the press roller, along the edges of the press. These runners should be about the same height of the block being printed and serve two purposes: Shelf support keeps end piece flush to end of block, strip with peg keeps the runners flush to sides of block letterpress chase is a shallow box, slightly lower in height than the block, that completely encloses the block to be printed. Pieces of wood called furniture are placed in the chase around the letter-form (the block to be printed) and the furniture locks the form so that it does not move while printing. valleys , where it may pick up unwanted ink. Thick blankets are used sometimes when embossing is desired. Fantastic Garden blocks, I am faced with deeply carved blocks, next to shallow delicate carvings, next to dark areas next to line work. Quite a challenge to please everyone! http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX3zMh-qyRRieyCmzEgGdWQ Maria Arango Diener 8:12 PM Email This BlogThis!
