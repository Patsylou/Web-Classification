Continent :: Update Overview The mining sector in Guinea contributes around 25% of the country’s income, with bauxite production by far the most important contributor. The past few years have been characterised by an ongoing programme to modernise and re-structure the aluminium industry to make it efficient and profitable, and to increase production. Guinea has one of the worlds largest bauxite reserves as well as being one of the largest producers, after Australia. It is estimated that Guinea contains an estimated 24% of global bauxite reserves. Guinea accounts for 94% of Africas bauxite production. Bauxite accounts for 20% of Guineas GDP and 90% of exports. Gold and diamonds are also major export products. Although Guinea has significant commodity reserves, the country has been poorly explored and future potential exists for gold, base metals, iron ore and diamonds. A new mining code introduced in mid-1995 offers a range of guarantees and tax incentives to new investors, who may now own up to 85% of any venture in Guinea. Guinea is underlain by the extensive Archaean West African craton. To the north and west of the country, younger Proterozoic rocks occur and to the east by the Birimian Supergroup, which includes greenstone belts, responsible for most of West Africas gold and iron ore reserves. Weathering of tertiary sediments and laterisiation has resulted in the formation of Guineas extensive bauxite deposits. :: Update Mineral Policy and Legislation 1. Mining Code The 1986 Mining Code was revised in 1995 of which a new edition including a translation into English was issued in October 1997. The code is based on French Civil Law and is comparable to that of other Francophone countries in the region. The code establishes a new Government Centre of Mining Promotion and Development (CPDM) which is receiving international financial support, including substantial sums from the World Bank in order to harmonise the code with other national legislation, to undertake new surveys and to create a national database of geological information. The CPDM is supposed to be a one stop window for investors. Applications for mining licenses are said to be processed within two months at most. 2. Right of Ownership on Minerals Deposits of minerals or fossil substances located below or on the surface of the ground, as well as underground water and geothermal resources belong to the State. Holders of mining titles have property right on extracted substances. 3. Mining Titles The Guinean Mining Code lists five different mining titles: 4. Mining Tax Regime Every holder of a mining title must pay fixed and variable surface fees, royalties, income tax and other taxes: Fixed and Surface Fees Description Fixed Fees (FG) Surface Fees (FG/km/year) Reconnaissance Permit Free Free Exploration Permit First Delivery 2.000.000 500 First Renewal 2.000.000 1.000 Second Renewal 3.000.000 2.000 Transfer 3.000.000 Extension 2.500 Exploitation Permit First Delivery 10.000.000 15.000 First Renewal 15.000.000 30.000 Second Renewal 15.000.000 40.000 Transfer 15.000.000 Extension 50.00 Mining Concession First Delivery 15.000.000 200.000 Renewal 20.000.000 200.000 Transfer 20.000.000 Extension 300.000 Royalties Bauxite Exported Bauxite 10% FOB value Bauxite processed into Alumina 5% Value calculated on basis of FOBCBF (Compagnie des Bauxites de Guine) Bauxite processed into Aluminum 0% Iron Imported Ore (Raw Ore) 7% FOB value Ore concentrates 3,5% FOB value Ore precessed into steel 0% Base Metals, Radioactive Substances and Particular Minerals Exported Ore 7% FOB value Ore concentrates 3,5% FOB value Ore precessed into Refined Prod. 0% Gold Dore Bare 5% London fixing Diamonds and gems Uncut stones 5-10% Sale value Cut stones 2% Sale value State participation in gold, diamonds and gems is 15% free equity.
