NOAA Tightens Halibut Bycatch Limits for Gulf of Alaska Groundfish Fisheries More NOAA Researcher Says Arctic Marine Mammals Are Ecosystem Sentinels As the Arctic continues to see dramatic declines in seasonal sea ice, warming temperatures and increased storminess, the responses of marine mammals can provide clues to how the ecosystem is responding to these physical drivers.

More Seabird Bycatch Estimates for Alaskan Groundfish Fisheries Seabird bycatch estimates for Alaskan groundfish fisheries from 1993 to 2012 update those previously reported from 1993 to 2006. More Yes, Virginia, Walleye Pollock is Gadus chalcogrammus The recent change of the scientific name of walleye pollock from Theragra chalcogramma to Gadus chalcogrammus has created some consternation among those working with this species. The decision to change the generic assignment came about through extensive genetic studies that examined the number of species and evolutionary relationships among the cods. More Gray Whale Calf Sightings Increase in Alaskan Arctic The occurrence of the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales, documented on summer feeding grounds in the northeastern Chukchi Sea by the Aerial Surveys of Arctic Marine Mammals project in June-October 2013, had 174 sightings of 281 gray whales on- and off-effort in the study area; 57 of these individuals were calves. More Distributions of Deep-sea Corals and Sponges Throughout Alaska The AFSCs research efforts to study deep-sea corals and sponges throughout Alaska through 2014 include improving the taxonomy of corals and sponges, determining potential fishing impacts from unstudied gear types, and determining the role of corals and sponges in Alaskas fishery production. More Ice Seal Distribution Data Available Distribution data for four species of ice-associated seals bearded, ringed, ribbon, and spotted sealsare available for download as well as accompanying status reviews which assess the risk of extinction at present and in the foreseeable future for each species due to concern about threats to the species' habitat from climate warming.
