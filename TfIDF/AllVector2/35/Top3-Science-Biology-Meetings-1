Besides covering important new developments in the use of EPR and in vivo NMR, the meeting is widely considered one of the premier meetings in the rapidly growing field of protein and nucleic acid structure determination by multi-dimensional NMR techniques. The Council membership , which consists of organizers of meetings over the preceding ten years, invites suggestions for future conferences . Conference venues rotate among North America, Europe, and other centers of biomolecular magnetic resonance activity. Each conference aims to develop an in-depth evaluation of the current status of the field and to determining the directions where magnetic resonance could have the greatest impact on addressing biologically important problems. XXVIth ICMRBS Meeting in Dallas, Texas, USA from August 24-29, 2014 Please visit the conference website for all details and contacts related to the conference.
