Unfortunately, next-generation workflows tend to be complex, time-consuming, and costly to perform. And — despite the increased efficiency of these systems, they still lack the ability to target specific areas of interest for sequence interrogation. With the SureSelect Target Enrichment System, only the genomic areas of interest are sequenced, creating process efficiencies that reduce costs and allow more samples to be analyzed per study. Reducing the amount of DNA being interrogated also allows investigators to perform experiments with more statistically relevant numbers of samples. The main objective of this course is to provide hands-on training in library preparation and target enrichment required for next-generation sequencing.   EMBL Corporate Partnership Registration Fee Fellowships are available for this meeting Training Conferences and Courses Genome Capture (Agilent) Programme Organisers Registration and Payment General Information Accommodation and Transport Contact Information for Participants Sponsorship Print Share Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Gmail Hotmail Yahoo!
