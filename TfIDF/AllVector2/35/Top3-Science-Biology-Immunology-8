The University of Chicago is located in Hyde Park, a distinctive south-side Chicago neighborhood that is home to a majority of University faculty, students, and staff.  Hyde Park is situated about seven miles (15 minutes) south of Chicago's downtown business district, commonly referred to as "The Loop".  Prospective Students will find a variety of activities and opportunities awaiting their arrival.
