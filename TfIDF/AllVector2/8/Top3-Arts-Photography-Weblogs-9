I don't know how to thank you for supporting me over the years. It's been a challenging, fun, rewarding, at times exhausting but overall incredible journey. And I couldn't have done it without you. This site and the archive remains. I also uploaded the full archive to a new flickr account which is a much more visual way to browse through the images, organized in sets for each of 10 years. It'd be great if I can tag all the images to make finding images easier, but that will take some major time. Find it here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddoi-archive/ But this is not a goodbye post. And I'm not quitting posting images. Far from it. I just won't be doing it daily. I'll be posting bigger and better images from now on. So here's a list of where you'll be able to see my upcoming work. Get your bookmarking tools and feed readers ready: 1. I'll be posting new images and videos, plus ddoi selects in larger size on my new topleftpixel tumblr page here: http://tumblr.topleftpixel.com/ 2. On my new topleftpixel blog , I'll be posting reviews, tips, tutorials and other articles about Photography, ddoi, Video making, Post Production and more. And here's where I'll be posting about ddoi related updates. Keep an eye for an exhibition or a book later this year. Find the blog here: http://blog.topleftpixel.com/ You can also find me on many other places online. A complete list of them can be found here: http://samjavanrouh.com Photos on this site will still be available to order, and in case Fotomoto stops its service, you can always send me an email directly and order prints, or ask about licensing or hiring me. Email me at inquire@topleftpixel.com inquire+testimonial@topleftpixel.com . I received incredible emails over the last few weeks and I really appreciate it. I hope you'll bookmark the new sites and continue following my work. I'm just getting started. And to begin, head on to the first post on the new topleftpixel blog to see a selection of ddoi images: http://blog.topleftpixel.com/2013/07/04/and-thats-a-wrap/ Thanks again, it's been unforgettable. | Register for the Daily Dose of Imagery Live Photo Walks facebook page | instagram | cool photoblogs | vfxy | copyright 2003-2013 Sam Javanrouh | info for usage | contact me
