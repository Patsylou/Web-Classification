Helmer Aslaksen's home page Objectives of the Module The goal of this course is to study astronomy and mathematics in a cultural context. We will look at questions like: How is the date of Chinese New Year determined? Why do the Muslim and Chinese months start on different days? Will the Moon ever look like it does on the Singapore flag? What date of the year is the earliest sunrise in Singapore? How did ancient sailors navigate? After taking this course you will become conscious of the motion of the Sun and the Moon and notice and question things you have earlier taken for granted. You will appreciate mankind's struggle through the ages and throughout the world to understand the mathematics of the heavens. This course is one of the General Education Modules at the NUS. Back to top of page Astronomical instruments in the Imperial Observatory in Beijing made by the Jesuit missionary Ferdinand Verbiest, 1670 Topics to be Covered We start by discussing the motion of the Sun and the Moon. Most astronomy books are written from a high northern latitude point of view, but in this course we will take a hemispherically correct, tropical point of view. We then look at applications with a cultural flavor. In Singapore we use the Gregorian, Chinese, Islamic and Indian calendars for determining the public holidays and you will learn the rules for these calendars. Most people expect the time of sunrise and sunset in Singapore to stay fixed throughout the year, but we will study the equation of time and the analemma to see why there is a half hour variation. Navigation has been important to people all over the world throughout history, and people at different latitudes developed fundamentally different methods. If we have time, we will look at ancient astronomical instruments , astrology , cartography , archaeoastronomy (the use of astronomy in archaeology), cultural astronomy and astronomy in nature . Back to top of page Brian Greig's astronomical instruments for sale at the Melbourne Arts Centre Sunday Market Practical Information and Assessment Classes There will be three hours of lectures and one hour of large group tutorial each week. The time slots in 2010/2011 Semester 1 are Monday and Thursday 8-10 a.m. in LT34. I take a 10 minutes break in the middle, and aim to finish by 15 to the hour. I realize that 8 am is not a good time, but that is what we were given. The module is very lecture intensive, so please do not take the module if you do not plan to attend lectures at 8 am. I'm only supposed to give three hours of lectures so on Thursday I will use the last hour (9 to 10) as a tutorial starting in Week 3. Alternatively, there will be a small group tutorial, too. (Wednesday 5-6 in LT34, starting in Week 3.) The first two weeks I use all four hours for lectures because there is so much practical stuff to cover. The last week there will be small tutorial and I will use all four hours for lectures and review. Feel free to attend whichever tutorial fits your schedule. The small one tends to be highly interactive. The timetable on IVLE lists the main tutorial as Thursday 10-11. This is WRONG! It will be Thursday 9-10, but is probably because it can't be listed at time because the lecture is listed at that time. I use a cordless microphone and walk around in class and ask questions. But don't worry, I only ask easy questions! I also like to create physical demonstrations to illustrate the concepts, and I often need for this. I am not afraid of looking silly, and I hope you are not either! The lectures will be NUScast. The goal of the webcast if to give you a chance to take another look at things you didn't catch, or to help you if arrive a couple of minutes late. They are not meant as a substitute for going to lectures. I'm afraid my lecturing style is not very suitable for webcast. I move around a lot, and I rely on physical demonstrations that probably will not show up in the webcast. Webcast is great for lecturers who read aloud from their lecture notes, which is not my style. Please do not take the module if you plan to rely on the webcast. Assessment The final exam counts 50% of your grade. There will be a midterm that counts 30%. There will also be a homework that counts 20% and is done in groups of four to six students. There will be a midterm test on Monday 27/9/2010 at 8 am in MPSH1 Section B. The homework is due at the beginning of class on Monday 25/10/2010. The exam will be on Monday 22/11/2010, 9-11 am. I want both hard copy and soft copy. Don't worry if the printed copy doesn't look nice, if for instance you don't have a color printer or if you have to do a printout of a web page you created. Please submit the soft copy of the homework to the IVLE workbin. However, I don't want to get 50 files called Homework.doc. Please use the number of your group as the first two characters in the file name. For example 04 Homework.doc. I have a special system for group assessment. Each group can either choose to have everybody get the same grade (the default), or you can choose to grade the others in your group, by saying how many percent of the final mark the others deserve. If you manage to agree, I will follow what you agree on! Just gather everybody and come and see me. If you cannot agree, come and see me (separately, if necessary), and I will take the average. But I will not let that average count 100%. I will give it a weight of x%, and the uniform distribution will get weight (100-x)%. I will not tell you what x is, and I may even use different x for different groups. I encourage you to discuss this in a polite, friendly, reasonable, generous and compassionate way, and make every effort to reach a unanimous decision. My weightage may not be fair, so try to sort it out yourselves. At the same time, I want to have a way to protect people from unreasonable group mates. To sum up: If you are OK with everybody getting the same mark, then do nothing. If you can all agree on a non-uniform marking scheme, then come and see me. If you cannot agree, then come and see me with your individual schemes and I will average and adjust. Groups Please do the homework in a group of four to six people. Don't worry if you have a hard time finding a group, you're probably not alone! Post a message on the discussion forum and you'll probably find other people in the same situation who you can form a group with. Homework I used to have two homework, but many students complained that it was too much work and too dependent on good weather, so I have simplified into one homework . Take three pictures showing the change in the setting (or rising) position of the Sun in the course of the semester Take three pictures showing the changes in the shadow cast by a ring Take pictures of the Western horizon on the first three days of the lunar month to determine the day of the first visibility of the lunar crescent, i.e., the first day of the Muslim month Take a picture of the first daytime visibility of the Moon Determine the tilt of the Moon when it is a crescent close to the horizon Estimate where and when the Sun can be seen from your window in the course of the year E-mail I get a lot of e-mail, so it would be helpful if you try to observe the following. If you are confused about something, chances are that a lot of other people in class are confused about the same. So why not post a question on the IVLE Forum? Then the answer will benefit everybody! And I won't have to answer the same question over and over again in individual e-mails! I know that some of you may not feel comfortable about asking a question, but trust me, most of your class mates will not think it is stupid. They will probably be very grateful to you! It's a great way to show some leadership! If the question involves geometrical arguments (as most of the material in this class does), it might be easier for both you and me if you ask me after class or come by my office some time. When people ask me about X, the problem is very often not that they don't understand X, but that there is something more basic they don't understand. When you ask me a question, try to state what you understand and what you understand. In that way we can get to the essence of your confusion more quickly. I don't mind your answer if you are genuinely unsure, but if you send me a long list of questions to check, including many that I'm convinced you know very well, I get the feeling that you're not really valuing my time. If you send me e-mail, please use the module code GEK1506 in the subject. Otherwise you may end up in my spam folder. This is especially important if you use a non-NUS e-mail address. Try to avoid sending me huge files. When you're submitting homework, you can use the workbin, burn a CD or bring a thumb drive along. If you have your own web page you can just send me a link. Many of the questions involve geometry, and it is hard to discuss it by e-mail. If you want to make an appointment to see me, just mail me and tell me when you are free.

It contains several useful tools. A discussion forum that I encourage you to use A workbin where you submit soft copies of homework A class list with e-mail addresses The latest timetable information Otherwise, the current page is the main source of information. Back to top of page Recommended Texts Unfortunately, there's no textbook for this course. Maybe I'll try to write one myself? The closest is The Ever-Changing Sky, A Guide to the Celestial Sphere by James B. Kaler . However, it goes into a lot more detail about astronomy than we will cover. The level of astronomy I expect you to learn is comparable to the first chapter and the appendix of The Copernican Revolution, Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought by Thomas S. Kuhn. For convenience, the main reference for the first part will be Strobel's Astronomy Notes on the web. I have compiled a list of additional references . In addition to the books by Kaler and Kuhn, I've also placed The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy by James Evans and Calendrical Calculations: The Millennium Edition by Nachum Dershowitz and Edward M. Reingold on RBR in the Science Library. Back to top of page Orrery by Brian Greig Astronomical Java Applets and Animations Together with Tey Meng Khoon and Frederick H. Willeboordse of CITA (Centre for Information Technology and Applications), I have developed interactive Java applets that I hope will help you understand the motion of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. You will notice that a lot of the applets are somewhat similar. They show the same thing, but we're trying to emphasis different aspects or points of view in each one. You can get the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) at java.com . If you prefer to view the applets off-line, you can download them. Just unzip astro-applets.zip, and open astro-applets.html in your browser. The Motion of the Earth Around the Sun . This is a pretty basic applet showing the Earth moving around the Sun. But pay attention to how you can determine the equinoxes and solstices by looking at the position of the Earth's axis, and how the declination changes. The Apparent Motion of the Sun . This shows the spiral of circles. The Apparent Motion of the Sun at Different Latitudes . Now you can see how the spiral of circles changes depending on your latitude. The Apparent Motion of the Sun at Different Times of the Year . This is one of my favorite applets, that I use over and over again in my class. If you really understand this applet, you will get a good grade in my class! The Motion of the Sun Along the Ecliptic . Another of my favorites. If you really understand this applet, you have arrived! A Vertical Sundial . One of the points of this applets, is to make you understand why you shouldn't make a vertical sundial. (Unless you are a polar bear or a penguin!) The Astrological Houses at Different Latitudes . Astrologers like to talk about your ascendant and other . Unfortunately, the house system depends very much on your latitude. Very few astrologers understand how this works. If you want to understand this, get the book Making Sense of Astrology by Ronny Martens, Tim Trachet and study this applet. What does the waxing or waning Moon look like in different parts of the world in the course of the year? This is something that confuses a lot of people! A simplified model of the tilt of the waxing or waning Moon in different parts of the world ignores the tilt of the ecliptic, and assumes that the Sun and the Moon both move along the celestial equator. You may want to start out with this applet. If you studied the previous applet, you are now hopefully ready for the real thing. What does the waxing or waning Moon look like in different parts of the world in the course of the year? The last two applets are related to What Does the Waxing or Waning Moon Look Like in Different Parts of the World? Back to top of page Equatorial (left) and ecliptic (right) armillary spheres in the Imperial Observatory in Beijing made by the Jesuit missionary Ferdinand Verbiest, 1670 Video Clips Together with Keith Phua Kuan Wee of CITA (Centre for Information Technology and Applications), I have recorded video clips to help you understand the material.

RealVideo LAN/150Kbps, right-click to download. QuickTime , click to stream, right-click to download. I have recorded video clips to explain the Java applets and Strobel's Astronomy Notes . Back to top of page Strobel's Astronomy Notes Nick Strobel of Bakersfield College has written a wonderful set of Astronomy Notes for his introductory astronomy course. His chapter on Astronomy Without a Telescope is very relevant background for this module. I have recorded video clips with annotations to some of the sections of the first chapter of Strobel's notes.

Observing the sky has always been an important part of human civilization. We give a summary of some basic facts from spherical astronomy. One of my students, Viduranga Yashasui Waisundara, has written a beautiful poem about this, called If I were God . There are a lot of Myths about the Copernican Revolution . Many people whose main interest is philosophy of science, but with little knowledge of astronomy or history of science, have written extensively about it. Unfortunately, much of what they say is incorrect. Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) Multimedia Please check out my Astronomical Java Applets and Animations and Astronomical Video Clips .

Back to top of page Calendars How is the date for Chinese New Year, Eid ul-Fitr (Hari Raya Puasa) and Deepavali determined? Singapore is unique in that we use four different calendars for determining the date of the public holidays. Seven of our eleven public holidays move, and we study the rules for Chinese New Year, the two Eid's (Hari Raya's), Deepavali, Vesak Day and Good Friday. The exact rules are very complex, but the basic ideas are simple. We give two simple rules of thumb that determine the date for Chinese New Year with a margin of error of one day. I have written a set of lecture notes on The Mathematics of the Public Holidays of Singapore . You will also see why both Eid ul-Fitrs (Hari Raya Puasas) in 2000 were celebrated one day earlier than they would have been if MUIS had relied on sightings or scientific criteria. Why is it difficult to determine the Islamic prayer times in Northern Europe? This is an interesting astronomical problem, which very few people understand. What are leap seconds? This requires understanding some delicate points in the definition of atomic time. Chinese astronomers determining the summer solstice General Calendar Info I have a page on Calendars in Singapore . It contains a paper I have written about The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar . I have also written a shorter introduction called When is Chinese New Year? .

If the link doesn't work, go to their homepage and look under or do a search for Takwim (or Taqwim). This will give you MUIS's prediction for first visibility of the lunar crescent. But it is based on a dubious method, so you will often not be able to see the Moon on the day when MUIS claims that you will. Please see my page on The Islamic Calendar .

Qibla - the direction to Mecca Determining the direction to Mecca was together with determining the first visibility of the lunar crescent and computing prayer times one of the central problems in Islamic astronomy. It requires a clear understanding of spherical trigonometry and knowing how to find longitude. However, you would think that at the moment it would be a trivial computation. I was therefore quite surprised when I started to receive e-mails from Muslims in the US and Canada asking me about it. I then realized that it is a major controversy among Muslims in North America. All the famous Muslim astronomers and mathematicians in the past, like al-Khwarizmi (780-850), al-Battani (858-929) and al-Tusi (1201-1274) agreed that qibla should be measured by great circle. However, some people who are used to looking at Mercator maps and don't understand that lines of sight are represented by great circles argue that you should draw straight lines on a Mercator map, i.e., follow rhumb lines. They strongly attack people who follow the traditional method of great circles. For examples of this, see Direction of Al-Qiblah , Determining the direction of the Qibla and Qiblah.us .

Back to top of page Observing the Sun and the Moon from Different Parts of the World This is one of my favorite topics. I have some lecture notes about this, which I'm trying to expand on. Most astronomy books are written from a point of view. I will discuss the motion of the Sun and the Moon from a point of view, with special emphasis on the needs of observers. I have a number of web pages about astronomical topics from a Singaporean point of view. What is with the Singapore flag? Why is the coat of arms more correct? Find out on my page on The Mathematics and Astronomy of the Singapore Flag . What Does the Waxing or Waning Moon Look Like in Different Parts of the World?

We are not just a multiracial, multicultural society; we are a multicalendrical society! Some of my students have contributed greatly to this. One of my favorites is the following e-mail from one of my students, LIEW Wen Hwee. Subject: The theory of hanging clothes to dry Hi Sir, Ohh my. I just discovered the theory behind my mum's theory of hanging clothes to dry. My mum have been telling me since I was a kid that for half of the year that she will have to hang the clothes out in the kitchen and the other half of the year in the corridor for them to dry. I was perplexed by her for a long time. I thought wasn't the sun suppose to rise East always? And your lesson cleared my doubts!!! My flat lies exactly (ermmm maybe not that exact. didn't notice tat until I used the compass. Was almost scared by a faulty compass that points in the direction where the sun rises!!!) in the East- west plane. And so for half of the year, the sun be in the South-east and the other half in the North-east. MY MUM IS AN ASTRONOMER !!!(ha.). Sir, what u have taught is of practical purpose!!! (Maybe u could tell the next batch of students abt tat and they could advise their mum on how to better dry their clothes. =)) Thanks a lot, Sir!!! Sun and Moon info The National Environment Agency on Singapore has a number of interesting pages, like Sunrise and Sunset Times, Moonrise and Moonset Times and Tide Times for Singapore . The Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory has a lot of interesting pages on their Data Services and Astronomical Information Center , like Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated , Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions , Earth's Seasons - Equinoxes, Solstices, Perihelion, and Aphelion, 2000-2020 , Complete Sun and Moon Data for One Day: Locations Worldwide and Sun or Moon Rise/Set Table for One Year: Locations Worldwide . You can use the last one to print out a table of rising and setting times for the Sun and the Moon in Singapore. The coordinates of Singapore are 104 east and 1 north. Our time zone is UTC + 8.

Singapore weather and tide info National Environment Agency on Singapore has a number of interesting pages, like WeatherWise Singapore , Climatology of Singapore , FAQs-Meteorological Service and Sunrise and Sunset Times, Moonrise and Moonset Times and Tide Times for Singapore . World Weather Information Service - Singapore from the World Meteorological Organization. Back to top of page The Equation of Time I have a separate web page on Which Day Does the Sun Rise Earliest in Singapore? Singapore lies almost on the equator, so most people would expect the Sun to rise at more or less the same time each day of the year. In fact, the sunrise time varies between 6:46 a.m. and 7:17 a.m., with the earliest sunrise on November 1 and the latest on February 9. In the same way, the sunset time varies between 6:50 p.m. and 7:21 p.m., with the earliest sunset on November 5 and the latest on February 13. The difference between the earliest and latest sunrise in 30 minutes, but the difference between the longest and shortest day is only 8 minutes. The key to understanding this is the analemma , which is a graphical representation of the equation of time. Analemma picture by Dennis di Cicco The famous picture by Sky Telescope's Dennis di Cicco records the Sun's position in the sky at the same time of day on 45 different dates throughout the year. This is also related to the concept of time zones. As you can see from the map , Singapore and West Malaysia are in the time zone! For more details, please see my page Why is Singapore in the time zone? Sundial in Enschede, Netherlands, 1836, photo by Fer J. de Vries. The Equation of Time I have recorded a video clip that explains this picture: RealVideo SureStream , RealVideo LAN/150Kbps , QuickTime .

We study the theory behind sundials and show how to construct an accurate sundial for any latitude. There are several nice sundials in Singapore. Sundial in Jurong Bird Park There is one in the Jurong Bird Park. one in the Botanic Gardens and one in Marina City Park . As part of their Science is everywhere program, The Singapore Science Centre together with the National Parks Board recently put up a series of sundials representing the planets. With Science Centre representing the sun, unique sculptures are placed at various locations around Singapore. The relative distance of these sculptures from the Science Centre represents the distances of each planet from the Sun. Please check out the map ! Four common types of sundials are the equatorial, armillary, horizontal and vertical sundials. Equatorial sundial Armillary Sundial at City Hall, Ruurlo, photo by Frans W. Maes.

Brass astrolabe, 17th century, Persia, Asian Civilisations Museum's collection, Singapore One of the most fascinating of all astronomical instruments is the Antikythera mechanism . The Antikythera Mechanism is the name given to an astronomical calculating device, measuring about 32 by 16 by 10 cm, which was discovered in 1900 in a sunken ship just off the coast of Antikythera, an island between Crete and the Greek mainland. Several kinds of evidence point incontrovertibly to around 80 B.C. for the date of the shipwreck. Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of Canterbury Tales wrote a Treatise on the Astrolabe in 1391. We then look at the cross-staff and the back staff. Cross-staff Backstaff We will compare the relative advantages of the quadrant, mariner's astrolabe and cross-staff. Quadrant Mariner's astrolabe Cross-staff The Chinese astronomer Guō Shǒujìng (郭守敬,1231-1314) designed many outstanding instruments.

Cross-staff used for computing lunar distance and height of buildings on the cover of Introductio geographica by Petrus Apianus, Ingolstadt, 1533 Why is it harder to determine the longitude than the latitude? In 1714 the British Parliament offered 20,000 pound to anybody who could come up with a practical method to determine the longitude at sea. That was the equivalent of US$12 million in modern money! The Astronomer Royal was only paid 100 pounds a year, and had to pay for his own instruments. We will watch the movie Longitude , starring Jeremy Irons, which is based on the best-selling book Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time by Dava Sobel.

Back to top of page Cartography Most capital cities have a geographical origin of coordinates, which is used when making maps for the country. All cities also have a zero point for road distances from the city center to other points. Why do capital cities need an origin of coordinates? In the past, finding coordinates, especially the longitude, was so hard that the best way was to pick a local origin, do astronomical observations at that point, and then do triangulation for the rest of the country. That's why the origin of coordinates is often at observatories. In London the origin of coordinates is at Greenwich, while the zero point for road distances is at Trafalgar Square. In Oslo the origin of coordinates is at the Observatory, while the zero point for road distances is at Stortorvet. But what about Singapore? After a bit of detective work, and a lot of help from various people, I found that the origin of coordinates is at Empress Place and the zero point for road distances is at the old General Post Office, now the Fullerton Hotel.

Moonrise from Sky Telescope What does the orbit of the Moon around the Sun look like? Most people, even almost all mathematicians I've asked this question, tend to believe that it will have loops and look something like the picture below. In fact it looks like this picture! It is not a circle, but is close to a 12-gon with rounded corners. It is locally convex in the sense that it has no loops and the curvature never changes sign. I have a page that explains why The Orbit of the Moon around the Sun is Convex! Halls Harbour, Nova Scotia, six hours apart Why are there two high tides each day? This is very frequently asked question! I used to think that the answer was simple, but after looking around in the library and on the web, I discovered several different attempts at explaining it. Newton's equilibrium theory from 1687 used the differential of the gravitational force, but some people (especially oceanographers) also consider a centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the Earth around the Earth-Moon barycenter. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the methods using a centrifugal force are unnecessarily complicated, if not outright wrong! I will describe some of the attempted explanations I found. How often can we see lunar and solar eclipses in Singapore? It turns out that it is fairly easy to make reasonably accurate eclipse predictions. There are several solar eclipses each year, but at a given place, they occur on average only every 360 years. Solar eclipses, Singapore lists all solar eclipses visible from Singapore between 1700 and 2100. The last total eclipse was in 1821, and there will be annular eclipses in 2019 and 2053, but I'm afraid there will not be any total eclipses in Singapore before 5 July 2168. How is astronomy related to the ice ages? It turns out that changes in the Earth's movement is related to the ice ages. Why does the Moon look bigger when it is near the horizon? Can you balance an egg on the Spring equinox? This turns out to be related to the Chinese calendar !

I will discuss some common misconceptions and hoaxes. One of my favorites is the Mars will be as big at the Full Moon e-mail. It has several variations, but here is a common one. The Red Planet is about to be spectacular! This month and next, Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded history. The next time Mars may come this close is in 2287. Due to the way Jupiter's gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit, astronomers can only be certain t! hat Mars has not come this close to Earth in the Last 5,000 years, but it may be as long as 60,000 years before it happens again. The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles of Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest object in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear 25.11 arc seconds wide. At a modest 75-power magnification Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot. At the beginning of August it will rise in the east at 10p.m. and reach its azimuth at about 3 a.m. By the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30a.m. That's pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in recorded history. So, mark your calendar at the beginning of August to see Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month. Share this with your children and grandchildren. NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN! Does this make you think that Mars will be as big as the Full Moon in the sky? That's NOT what they're saying, but you have to read carefully to not get tricked.
