I feel that I have an advantage over anyone who doesn't use this site in regular formats and daily formats. I can't imagine not having this success without Basketball Monster. I think this is the best fantasy site bar none for fantasy stats. jrwax2 BBM Podcast (2.20) February 20, 2014 by HoopAdvisors Staff Rest-of-Season Ranks v7.0 February 19, 2014 by Justin Phan Week 17 Primer February 16, 2014 by Justin Phan BBM Podcast (2.13) February 13, 2014 by HoopAdvisors Staff Rest-of-Season Ranks v6.0 February 12, 2014 by Justin Phan Listen to our latest podcast: RSS or iTunes Follow us on Twitter: @baskmonster @busersports @jphanned PLAYER COMMENTS Jermaine O'neal - Bogut is back in the lineup and Lee is expected back tomorrow, so no. [ jphanned ] Jermaine O'neal - don't laugh, but is it worth bringing up JO in any fantasy relevant discussion? [ Sonic Phantom ] Rajon Rondo - There were talks of his potentially being cleared during this past road trip. Obviously he wasn't but it bodes well for him being ready another three-plus weeks from now. [ mbuser ] Kevin Seraphin - Booker looks to be the starter now in any case, with Seraphin dealing with lingering knee soreness. [ mbuser ] Rajon Rondo - thoughts on rondo being able to play back to backs by the time fantasy playoffs roll around? [ sofsetzer ] Raymond Felton - What an idiot. [ Chubs33 ] Kevin Seraphin - Seraphin's revised rating is surprising given Trevor Booker is still around. Wouldn't Booker be starting over Seraphin? [ johnd2442 ] Raymond Felton - Hard to say. Beno would have been a winner if he wasn't waived. Prigioni will be the main ast beneficiary but tough to see him averaging double digit points. More mins for JR/Tim [ NMV112 ] Raymond Felton - any presumptive pickups/winners if Felton is out? [ j_diggs ] Raymond Felton - Charged with second, third, and fourth degree possession of a firearm. Second-degree charge alone carries a max of 15 years in prison. Check the Status Updates page for more. [ jphanned ] Raymond Felton - Considering NYC laws regarding firearms possession, this could very easily end his career. [ ZeroStatic ] Jamal Crawford - Impressive rise in FG% and minutes. [ kdavehill ] Raymond Felton - ... i have no words [ sofsetzer ] James Anderson - Granger buy out will make him relevant in standard leagues [ ehrenberggreg ] Thaddeus Young - Big winner from trade deadline [ halpink31 ] Copyright ÂŠ Centef LLC 2002-2014 - All Rights Reserved Content 2014, The Sports Network .
