Now there is interior redesign. Also called redesign home staging, real estate staging, one-day decorating, or home arrangement, interior redesign involves one day interior design makeovers of your home using what you already own. We do what many home decorators dont do -- we give your interior dcor an elegant, sophisticated look using your existing furnishings. And we do it in one day. Justin Ryan from HGTV's Home Heist says, Don't be afraid to add or to switch around pieces from one room to another, to give a home a fresh identity -- one that should reflect your personal style. This is what redesign is all about. To have a career in interior design, interior decorating, or home staging, you dont need a college education, or to go to decorating school for years. You can start your business right away with a one-week course that provides training in both interior redesign and home staging.
