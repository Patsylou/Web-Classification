Labels: portfolio , typography posted by Old Glutton @ 4:28 PM Permalink 4 comments 7.22.2010 To keep my one-hour Los Angeles commute from feeling like a monotonous or frustrating routine, I occasionally take a longer, scenic route and I always listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, satellite radio or NPR. Sometimes I cannot wait to get back into the car and hear the rest of something that I am really enjoying. Below is a roundup of my favorite commute listening material. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Podcasts • free Design Matters (about 1 hour) Debbie Millman (President of AIGA, etc , etc , etc. ) interviews big names in graphic design. I love getting a glimpse into the personalities behind the work I have been studying and admiring for years. I fiendishly episode-binged Design Matters and was sad when I ran out of new episodes. I feel like they were an important part of my design education and I am forever grateful for them. Debbie has taken a short sabbatical from Design Matters but will return in the Fall of 2010 with her SVA Masters of Branding students (I know one of them , I feel so connected). I can't wait! 20052009 [ iTunes ] [ Design Observer ] 20092010 [ iTunes ] [ Design Observer ] This American Life (approx. 1 hour) Hosted by Ira Glass, This American Life delivers "Stories that are like movies for radio." It is not surprising that this podcast wins all of the major broadcasting awards. I am happy to be sucked in to one of these gems every week. [ iTunes ] [ thisamericanlife.org ] Savage Love ( about 3045 minutes) Sex advice columnist, Dan Savage answers sex and relationship questions from callers. The show is funny, sexual, blunt and vulgar. The opening tune is "If you’re stuck in a relationship quandary or if you’re looking for sexual harmony, well, there’s nothing you can’t ask on the Savage Lovecast." It took a few episodes before I started to really love this podcast, but now I am hooked. If I ever had a bad day, I listen to this podcast because it often makes me laugh-out-loud. [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] The World in Words (usually less than 30 minutes) The World in Words covers language and linguistics with a global perspective. [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] The Moth (about 15 minutes) The Moth features "stories told live without notes." Sometimes the stories are funny, sometimes sad and sometimes thought-provoking. [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] Stuff You Should Know (under 1 hour) Stuff You Should Know is published by HowStuffWorks.com that features quick overviews on topics you might wonder about or learned in grade school and forgot. A few recent topics were: " How do butterfly wings get their color? ," " How Food Cravings Work ?" and " President Obama's Health Care Plan: Soup to Nuts ." [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] A Prairie Home Companion's News From Lake Wobegon (1520 minutes) Garrison Keillor makes me laugh. Enough said. [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] Radiolab (about 1 hour) Brilliantly edited, Radiolab features excellent music entwined with thought-provoking ideas, stories, and information. [ iTunes ] [ RSS ] Onion Radio News (about 1 minute) I love these sarcastic-funny episodes. Unfortunately, my iPod/car dock setup does not allow me to cycle through episodes without undocking. These episodes are so short that it is rather inconvenient (and probably dangerous) for me to be docking/selecting/redocking/etc. I listen to this at a computer. If your set up allows you to shift through episodes, I highly recommend this one for a good laugh.

Audiobooks • $$ varies My father-in-law generously added me as the second user on his audible.com account. This allows me to download any of his archives and use any of his built up credits for new books. Lucky me! I love listening to audiobooks, especially when I find a good one. When I get a really good one, I cannot wait to get in my car each day to listen. I usually read nonfiction, but I have found myself enjoying humor, fiction, and chick-lit in audiobook format. I have also found that the voice delivering the audiobook is almost as important as the content. A monotonous or whiney voice can kill a good book. I particularly enjoy listening to author-read unabridged books. Below are a selection of audiobooks that I have enjoyed. Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia (12 hours and 49 minutes) By Elizabeth Gilbert Narrated by: Elizabeth Gilbert I am happy that I listened to this book in audiobook format, but it is likely a good book in written form as well. Elizabeth Gilbert chronicles her post-divorce journey of self discovery as "she eats (in Italy), prays (in India), and finds love (in Indonesia)." (© AudioFile, 2006) This was the first audiobook I listened to and I was so completely hooked. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] [ amazon (CD) ] When You Are Engulfed in Flames (9 hours and 3 minutes) By David Sedaris Narrated by: David Sedaris I find David Sedaris to be hilarious both in written and audiobook form. When You Are Engulfed in Flames is the first author-read audiobook I have listened to by Sedaris, and I found it so funny that I will go back and listen to all of his books that I have previously enjoyed reading. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] [ amazon (CD) ] The Devil Wears Prada (14 hours and 4 minutes) By Lauren Weisberger Narrated by Bernadette Dunne This is totally indulgent chick-lit at its finest. It made my commute seem so short. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee (5 hours and 42 minutes) By Sarah Silverman Narrated by: Sarah Silverman I think this book is best delivered in audiobook format. It was full of snarky, self-deprecating humor. It is not as funny as Sarah's on-air comedy, but I still had a few lol moments so it was totally worth it. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] [ amazon ] Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 (6 hours and 28 minutes) By Garrison Keillor Narrated by Garrison Kielor If you enjoy Garrison Kielor's podcast, there are plenty of his books to listen to. Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a good/funny one. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] Linchpin: Are You Indispensable? (8 hours and 27 minutes) By Seth Goodin Narrated by Seth Godin Seth Godin talks about how to become a Linchpinsomeone who is an indispensable, proactive leader/connector/inventor. Someone who draws their own map from any level within an organization. [ audible ] [ iTunes ] Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (8 hours) By Anthony Bourdain Narrated by Anthony Bourdain Humorous and full of interesting foodie info.

SIRIUS Satellite Radio • about $13 per month My car came with a 3-month free SIRIUS membership and I listened primarily to news and to Howard Stern. I enjoyed Howard Stern so much that I often sat in my car at home to finish listening. I intend on renewing if I ever run out of podcasts and audiobooks that interest me.

It was created by Sara Wood , a student at University of the Arts. It was created for an assignment where she was asked to visually respond to the word mortality. I look forward to seeing more work from Sara.

From Erin's blog : This is a poster I designed for a bride who wanted to surprise her husband on their wedding day. She commissioned this because he loves cakes, cookies and all things sweet. She had the poster framed and displayed beside their wedding cake at the reception to surprise him! Labels: illustration posted by Old Glutton @ 6:34 AM Permalink 0 comments 11.08.2009 I love watching infomercials because they are a reminder of how complicated our lives have become. They leave me wondering how humanity has survived without such useful inventions as the battery-powered battery charger and the bottom wiper ? For this post, I am specifically focusing on the gadgets that were designed with the intention of making our lives easier in the kitchen. Octodog Hot Dog Shaper If you are not skilled with a knife, the Octodog will help you squish a tube of subpar porker parts into a shape resembling an octopus. Spaghetti Ice Cream Maker If 8-legged frankfurters do not persuade your kid to eat, surely transforming ice cream into the shape of spaghetti, lasagna or asparagus will do the trick. The Spaghetti Ice Cream Maker , which appears to be a re-branded pasta maker, will disguise your cold sweets to appear hot and savory. Twirling Spaghetti Fork Hog Wild, the makers of the Moo Mixer , have come up with a solution for the strenuous work that is required to eat spaghetti. Please note: To install the batteries, you will have to unscrew the lid from the battery compartment with a twirling motion. If this task is cumbersome for you, you may need to enlist the help of a friend. Banana Guard Safely transport your banana in this phallic plastic carrying case. From the banana guard website: Remarkably this device fits over 90% of commercially available bananas. How? Highly curved bananas can be straightened slightly to fit into upper curve and very straight bananas can be bent ever so slightly to fit into the mold. Just remember to eat the banana quickly after smooshing it in the case because it is likely to bruise. Battery Powered Flour Sifter For those of you who cannot be bothered with turning a crank, but are okay removing the batteries come cleaning time, the battery powered flour sifter is sure to make your life easier. In-The-Shell Electric Egg Scrambler Let's face it, whipping an egg is hard work, so the folks at Ronco have introduced an Electric In-The-Egg Scrambler . At first, I didn't understand how this product worked, but this video explained it all. If you have trouble getting the whipped egg to drool out the hole, the next tool is for you. Mechanical Egg Cracker If you have the patience to clean this contraption, but cracking an egg is a real nuisance for you, then you will love this Egg Cracker . Handy Peel Instant Peel Gloves The days of peeling veggies will be far behind you if you purchase these easy-to-clean spud exfoliators . The Magic Bullet This simple, 21-piece, single serve blender contraption, will certainly make your life easier. The magic bullet "does ANY job in 10 seconds or less," and only costs $99. Solid Flavor Injector For four easy payments of $39.95, you can get the solid food injector, which will save your fingers from the labor of pushing a garlic clove into meat.
