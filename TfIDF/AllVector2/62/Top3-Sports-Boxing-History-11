From Sydney , where Daniel Geale took his first fight back since losing his title to Darren Barker, stopping countryman Garth Wood in the sixth, over to Macao , where IBF lightweight champion Miguel Vasquez won on points, but was unimpressive against a much shorter Denis Shafikov. Behind the Results with Eric 'Posted' Armit . February 18 Bangkok, Thailand: Fly: Nawaphon (20-0) W TKO 4 Shusong Zhuang (0-3). Bantam: Srisaket (25-3-1) W KO 2 Alexis Barateau (0-2). Bantam: Suriyan (33-5-1) W KO 1 Serichai (0-1) Nawaphon vs. Zhuang Srisaket vs. Barateau Suriyan vs. Serichai February 19 Geale vs. Wood Berridge vs. Foley Pitt vs. Solitua Quinn vs. Revill MacKenzie vs. Tebebu February 20 Concepcion vs. Fontes Mosquera vs. Munoz Arias vs. Nunez February 21 Robinson vs. Kozaev Lock vs. Mtagwa Cleveland, OH, USA: Light: Henry Lundy (24-3-1) W PTS 10 Angelo Santana (14-2). Light Welter: Amir Imam (13-0) W TKO 4 Jared Robinson (14-1).

Feather: Toka Kahn Clary (10-0,1ND) W TKO 2 Carlos Fulgencio (19-13-1) Johnson vs. Velasquez Clary vs. Fulgencio Orange, Australia: Light Middle: Sam Ah See (10-0-1) W PTS 10 Shannon King (7-1). Local fighter See wins the vacant Australian title with a split decision over returning King in a tough close fight. Despite King enjoying a height and reach advantage the superior skills of See saw him build an early lead and extended it when he punched and bundled King through the ropes in the fifth with the referee giving King a disputed eight count. The strength of King told in the late rounds as he swept rounds six to eight inflicting a cut below the left eye of See in the eighth. See took the ninth and staged a strong last round only to be deducted a point for a head butt. Scores 96-92, 97-94 and 93-97. The draw on the 22-year-old southpaw’s record was of the technical variety and he beat that opponent in a return. Brisbane’s King was having his first fight since winning this same title in February last year. He lost the title though inactivity. He was the stronger man over the closing rounds but started his surge too late. See and King were Nos. 2 and 3 respectively in the ANBF ratings. Doncaster, Australia: Super Middle: Zac Dunn (12-0) W PTS 10 Oscar D Veliz (30-22-2,1ND). Young Dunn gets decision over experienced Argentinian. The unbeaten former amateur star, who holds the WBC Youth title, was a comfortable winner in a good learning fight. Scores 100-90 twice and 99-92. The 23-year-old ANBF No 4 is a former Australian Youth champion who won a bronze medal at the World Cadet Championships and was a quarter-finalist at the World Youth Championships. Veliz, 35, a former South American champion, had lost to Shannan Taylor and for the vacant WBFoundation title to Les Sherrington in earlier visits to Australia. Arezzo, Italy: Light Middle: Orlando Fiordigiglio (17-0) W KO 2 Janos Varga (16-21-1) European Union champion Fiordigiglio easily disposes of Hungarian Varga. After scoring with good shots in the first round Fiordigiglio produced a thunderous right uppercut in the second that put Varga down and out. The 29-year-old former undefeated Italian champion has 8 wins by KO/TKO. He defends his European Union title and fights for the vacant WBC International title against Spaniard Ruben Varon next month. Varga, 25 is 3-11 in his last 14 fights and this was his 14th loss by KO/TKO. Suwannakhet, Laos: Bantam: Tepparith (26-3) W KO 9 Alvin Bais (13-4). Fly: Saenmuangloei (19-5-3) W PTS 12 Mike Landero (16-11-4) Tepparith vs. Bais Saenmuangloei vs. Landero London, England: Middle: Elliott Matthews (10-0-1) W TEC DEC 8 Diego Burton (4-3-1). After a shaky start Matthews boxes his way to victory. Burton landed a hard right in the first and looked to have scored a knockdown but the referee ruled it a slip. Burton continued to apply pressure over the next four rounds but Matthews had his act together and was outboxing Burton and not getting involved. Matthews had a good sixth as he was able to score with quick, accurate punches with Burton unable to match him. Burton made a big effort in the seventh but again the cleaner work was coming from Matthews who was now well in control. In the seventh a clash of heads saw Matthews cut over the right eye. After good corner work he came out for the eighth but the referee consulted the doctor and the fight was stopped. Referee’s score 78-74 as Matthews, 32, retains his BBB of C Southern Area title. Burton, 27, was having his first ten round fight and had only had one scheduled eight round fight so was stepping up in class and distance. Laughlin, NV, USA: Light: Chris Rudd (13-1) W PTS 7 Yakubu Amidu (21-5-2). Light: Petr Petrov (33-4-2) W PTS 6 Fedor Papazov (14-1). Light: Miguel Gonzalez (23-3) W PTS 6 Miguel A Mendoza (21-3-2).

Cruiser: Eric Fields (24-2) W PTS 6 Rayford Johnson (8-15) Miller vs. Engel Fields vs. Saribekian Jayapura, Indonesia: Light Fly: Muhammad Rachman (65-11-5) W TKO 12 Thongthailek (18-16). Still life in the old dog yet as Rachman floors Thai in rounds 8 and 11 and finishes the job with another knockdown in the last which sees the fight halted. The 42-year-old former IBF and WBA strawweight champion wins the vacant IBO International title. He took two years out after a run of 5 losses in 6 fights and this is his second win since returning. The Thai, 16 years younger, had won 9 of his last 10 fights.
