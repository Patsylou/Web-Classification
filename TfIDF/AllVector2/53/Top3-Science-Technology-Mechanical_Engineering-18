The department started with two undergraduate students and currently accommodates approximately 1600. It has a long record of innovation and achievement in both undergraduate and graduate teaching and research. It prepares young men to become mechanical engineers whose role is to meet the growing technical requirements of various industries in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The undergraduate program, which is normally revised every five years, keeps track of the rapid development in science and technology and was recently accredited by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET). The department has two established graduate programs leading to the Master of Science (M.S.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Degrees in Mechanical Engineering. The faculty members conduct state-of-the-art research in order to enrich the literature in many areas such as thermo fluid sciences, applied materials, and engineering mechanics. ​ News Events Title A NEW PARADIGM ON RESEARCH-INNOVATION-COMMERCIALIZATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL SUCCESS by Dr. Ibrahim Dincer Professor of Mechanical Engineering UNIVERSITY OF ONTARIO CANADA Thursday: February 13th, 2014 Mechanical Engineering Department is pleased to announce the offering of next seminar on “ADVANCES IN MEMBRANE DISTILLATION FOR WATER DESALINATION: PAST AND PRESENT TOWARDS THE FUTURE” by Prof. Mohamed Khayet, Department of Applied Physics I, University Jahanzaib Malik, M Abdul Azeem, and Dr. Ihsan-ul-Haq Toor have won the best poster award in "the 15th Middle East Corrosion Conference (2~ 5th February, 2014, Kingdom of Bahrain", Title: Effect of Annealing Temperature on Corrosion Behavior of Two Stainl Senior Design Projects of the Term 131-in Building 24, Rooms 130, 149,162, 165 and 180 on MONDAY, 16 December and WEDNESDAY, 18 December ME 218 Poster Presentations and Competition : Thursday December 26/12/2013 MS Thesis Defense of Mr. Abdul Azeem Mohammed entitled “Thixoforging of Aluminum Nano-composites Synthesized by Ultrasonic Stir Casting” scheduled to be held at 2:00 p.m. today (Dec. 24, 2013) in Bldg. 22-130. 18th Sept 2013 , Numerical Simulation in the Oil Gas Industry by Mr. Mike Slack, Fluids Team Leader, Ansys UK Technical Services Thursday : September 26, 2013 Prof. Sang Cheol, KAIST, Korea Presents a Semninar on Automobile Industry Wednesday : October 09, 2013 Mr. Husam Mohammad Walwil Research Assistant Mechanical Engineering Department Wednesday : October 30, 2013 SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CVD GRAPHENE SYNTHESISED ON COPPER FOIL SUBSTRATES All News..
