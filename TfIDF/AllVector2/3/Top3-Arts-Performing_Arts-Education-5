Welcome to the CCPA home page. As Dean, I have the privilege of interacting with the remarkable faculty and students of the College all the time. When I go to a performance, either of the Theater Conservatory or the Music Conservatory, I get chills from the extraordinary level of accomplishment demonstrated by all of our students, and feel extraordinarily proud of how our faculty has helped them to develop their talents to the fullest. We pride ourselves on preparing young artists for careers in the performing arts, and in creating a mutually supportive and encouraging culture in which they can flourish. - Henry Fogel, Dean of CCPA News and Announcements February 19, 2014 Roosevelt's Chamber Orchestra to perform and record Stacy Garrop's music Free performance to be held at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, March 4 in Roosevelt University's 7th floor Ganz Hall.
