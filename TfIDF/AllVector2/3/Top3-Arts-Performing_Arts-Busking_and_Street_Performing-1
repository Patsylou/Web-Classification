 At a media event in City Hall on February 19th, the Edmonton International Street Performers Festival kicked off its 30th Anniversary year with performances, the announcement of a NEW fundraiser, and the unveiling of a NEW look. The NEW Festival fundraiser, Vaudeville Madness, took place on February 22nd and was a success in transforming the winter ‘blahs’ into 'oohs ahhs'…while raising funds for the Festival and its programs. Thank you to all who bought tickets and enjoyed the show! And extra special thanks for the artists involved (Annie Dugan from Firefly Circus; singer-songwriter Andrea House; Ron Pearson with his Mystery Wonder Show, Calgary stunt clown Gustavo the Impossiblist, and Aytahn Ross with his circus/comedy act, The Great Balanzo.) Thank you also to the Festival Board of Directors who initiated and implemented this fundraiser in support of StreetFest. The Festival also unveiled a new look for its 30th year. Over the coming months, our new brand will be unrolled along with the 2014 Festival campaign. “Here at StreetFest we take the business of “happiness”- aka “smiling”- as serious business. As we celebrate our 30th anniversary, we’ve set a goal to make Edmonton one of the happiest places on earth. We want you to share a smile at every turn. Our new logo characterizes the essence of our Festival. Today and tomorrow,” said Festival Board President Sue Broderick. The 30th Anniversary Edition of the Edmonton International Street Performers Festival takes place in Sir Winston Churchill Square, July 4 – 13, 2014.
