 Videos for developers: Welcome to the ASCOM Initiative This is the home of the ASCOM Initiative, a loosely-knit group of astronomy software developers and astronomy device manufacturers devoted to vendor-independent plug-and-play control. ASCOM is a many-to-many and language-independent architecture, supported by most astronomy devices which connect to Windows computers. The diagram below shows how ASCOM differs from traditional astronomy instrument control architectures. A HAPPY DEVELOPER I've just been able to fix a rather obscure problem with my ASCOM drivers thanks to the wealth of information available, including the great VS templates. Once again, I should say, the samples etc. have also been of great help in the past. As a manufacturer/developer, and of course as an astronomer, I find ASCOM to be one of the best things to have happened to the community, and it's getting better with every new version. So just wanted to say - Thank you guys! Jaime Alemany - Luntico Astronoma S. L. ASCOM Platform 6SP3 is Current For more information on the ASCOM Initiative, see the About ASCOM section.
