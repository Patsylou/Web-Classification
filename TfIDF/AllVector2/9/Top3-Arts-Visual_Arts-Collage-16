 Pat Street: Artist and Author Click here for Digital and Traditional Collage Art Welcome to my Web site! I use antique paper items -- maps, tickets, photos, letters, playing cards, sheet music, postcards, and text and images from old books -- to create witty, evocative collages with a contemporary edge. Click above to see my collages. Click here for "There's a Frog in My Throat! 440 Animal Sayings a Little Bird Told Me" A great new book! For more than 20 years, I've collected idioms and sayings. Now there's a book of animal sayings from my huge collection, along with their meanings and colorful, funny illustrations by my co-author, Loreen Leedy. Published by Holiday House in 2003, this book is meant for children as well as for adults who are learning English. It's now available on Amazon.com! E-mail Pat Street!
