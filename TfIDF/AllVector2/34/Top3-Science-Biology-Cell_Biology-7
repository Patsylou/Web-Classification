 Research Explore Research at NYMC Cancer, a leading cause of death worldwide, will claim an estimated half million American lives this year. Its many deadly forms are characterized by uncontrollable growth and spread of abnormal cells .

They apply their discoveries and insights toward the development of more effective tools for the diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of treatment in individual patients. Current research f ocuses on development of novel single cell assays to determine the mechanisms by which tumor cells differ from normal cells in how they control their growth; how cells repair damage to their genetic material, DNA; the development of sensitive tools to detect how cells identify and respond to various environmental insults that damage DNA; a method for investigating potential anti-aging molecules that reduce the likelihood of DNA damage; research into the cellular pathways of apoptosis, or cell death, and important cell response; and studies applying these assays in translational research to monitor individual patients' response to chemotherapy.
