Its aim is to increase student sensitivity to the visual arts, to refine the powers of critical analysis, and to provide the student with the means of creative expression. The rich resources of the surrounding area, especially the museums and architecture of Worcester and Boston, form an integral part of the curriculum and the department provides students with opportunities for internships in these cities.   Tutorials are available with individual faculty to allow students to design courses suited to individual needs. The department sponsors numerous programs for gaining a broad understanding of the practice and study of the arts today: lectures and demonstrations by visiting artists and critics, student presentations of seminar research in open fora, and regular trips to Boston and New York galleries and museums. There are two divisions in the Visual Arts Department, art history and studio art. Students may major or minor in either art history or studio art. Students may also combine a major in one area with a minor in the other.
