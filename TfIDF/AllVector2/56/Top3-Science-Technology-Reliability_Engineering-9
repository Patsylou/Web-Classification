When equipment problems are chronic, and the answer is far from obvious, sometimes all that we can do is laugh. When I'm stonewalled I look at these little guys in my office and I think to myself ... GREMLINS ! ! Because think about it. What is the first thing that you say to yourself when you finally DO find the problem? HOW DID THIS GET IN HERE !!?
