LME is active in the field of marine engine and ship propulsion systems research, with studies of ship engine and propeller interaction and investigations for the improvement of marine engine efficiency, for reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The activities of the LME cover the areas of main and auxiliary engines and ship’s machinery. The Laboratory houses large experimental facilities, where detailed measurements can be conducted, allowing the validation of theoretical studies and mathematical models.   The test bed facility includes dynamometers, which can be coupled to engines of up to 1000 kW and allow the execution of complex dynamic loading experiments. Substantial computational resources are used for the development of simulation models, for engine and propulsion systems design, optimization, performance evaluation, emission predictions and control systems development. A major activity is also the development of mobile shipboard measurement systems capable of synchronous collection of data on performance and emissions parameters, thus providing a complete characterization of the power plant.
