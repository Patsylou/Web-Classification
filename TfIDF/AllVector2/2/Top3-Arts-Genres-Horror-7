With Romeros status as the Godfather Of The Dead and cover artist Zombie King Suydams zombified renditions of classic film and comic art, its more than fitting that the two are united in Marvel Comics epic 15-issue mini-series, EMPIRE OF THE DEAD. Read More Blood on a Budget Blood on a Budget: More Psycho Sick Lunatics Patrick Dolan on February 25, 2014 | Leave a comment Featuring Bludgeon and Shism Psychoses are a tricky subject. When presented on film, people who suffer from this rarely get the politically correct treatment. Their portrayal tends to fall into one of two categories: the family of diverse, kindhearted kooks of a psychiatric facility ( Girl, Interupted , The Princess and the Warrior , One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest ) or the solo psycho on the verge of -or in the midst of- a killing spree ( Maniac , Pieces , Psycho ). Sometimes the two are even combined ( Dont Look in the Basement ). Few films venture out of these stereotypes, and even fewer horror films. Although the films of this entry tend to gravitate near the solo psycho and the sympathetic clan of crazies categories -not to mention playing fast-and-loose with political correctness- they still manage break out of the box in they portrayals of psychiatric disorders.

Skinny Puppy The day that Skinny Puppy’s “Live Shape for Arms” tour thundered into Toronto, February 18, 2014, the music news world was focused on the fact that date was the 40th anniversary of the release of the first KISS album. No doubt that debut was important to rock ’n’ roll. But when it comes to celebrating the impact and longevity of a group, I am personally much more excited that next month marks 30 years since Skinny Puppy released its first cassette, Back and Forth .

When not working on films such as Up and Ratatouille , Cooley takes scenes from R-rated movies (including Jaws , Alien and Pans Labyrinth , among others) and illustrates them as if they were meant for a childrens book. The results are nothing short of amazing. Read More Older posts Search for: Recent Posts HAIL TO THE KING! NEW GODZILLA TRAILER!
