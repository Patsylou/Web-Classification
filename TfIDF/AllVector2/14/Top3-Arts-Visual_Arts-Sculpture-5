 World Sensorium World Sensorium World Sensorium is an olfactory artwork of statistical symbolism and inclusive aesthetic for sensory experience. The message organically embodied in World Sensorium , by the methodological process for its creation and the molecular properties of the natural materials, is one of peace, unity and environmentalism. The artists focus for the decade prior the millenium to the present has been to create a work of art that would be a force of consciousness and transformation, an egalitarian landmark in collective memory, and an experience dedicated to increasing humanitys understanding of itself and its co-evolution with the environment. Through this artwork people can experience the world as a single complex scent. They can explore the molecular language of plants as it affects the internal territory of human memory and consciousness. World Sensorium , country representatives of the world have helped identify a culturally significant scent that embodies cultural meaning for their country. The chosen scents, from fragrant trees, plants, and herbs, are distinctive aromas critical to each countrys cultural memory, the sources often having been utilized intensively as medicine, food, and shelter or venerated in religious and cultural practices for centuries. In this regard, there are cultural statements from each nation. World Sensorium is a thoughtprovoking guidepost at this symbolically important turn in history. Copyright Nalls Studio Inc. 1997-2008
