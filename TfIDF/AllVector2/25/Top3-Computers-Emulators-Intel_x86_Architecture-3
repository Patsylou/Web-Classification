[Read more] Light-weight Plex86 posted by RvnPhnx , Fri 14 Feb 2003 05:41:48 PM UTC - 3 replies Kevin has resumed work on a lighter-weight version of Plex86. I'm still not sure if I plan to keep working with this fork or not. Check his new site out at: http://plex86.sf.net Patch Criteria...... posted by RvnPhnx , Fri 08 Nov 2002 04:33:29 AM UTC - 2 replies If you want a good idea as to how I think about patches (and why they aren't being added to the old plex86 tree for the time being...) then you should have a look at what Linus said about how he accepts patches for his project.
