Here's a list of what's new: A small bug concerning how VB deals with registry accesses on Win7 64Bit, causing a \"Runtime error 13\". More specifically the part that recalls the last window positions. Added in some type conversion function calls and reports fixed the problem. A few minor adjustments here and there. Removed the 32bps option and a warning will issue if you attempt to set a sample rate above 48Khz. This is a limitation of uematsu.dll, not JCOM-SPC or SNESAPU.dll. Removed the code for the REALMagic remote control and a few other cosmetic bits. The upshot of this is that JCOM-SPC should run with the plain vanilla VB6 runtime which is supplied by default with pretty much every version of windows since XP. NO MORE RUNTIMER!!! Also JCOM-SPC is now pretty much Windows user profile safe. Debug logging is now written to the current user's My Documents folder as \"JCOM-SPC-LOG.txt\" and any temporary files get generated in the current user's TEMP folder. This will be the last version of the this codebase. Development on a brand new from scratch JCOM-SPC is slowly in progress. Emphasis on slowly... You can grab it at our JCOM-SPC download page . Thanks to Hojo Norem for the news. read comments (0) Sega Megadrive/Genesis VGM Player 162 days ago posted by Montie2k Sega Megadrive/Genesis VGM Player plays VGM files on the real machine (after conversion to optimised format).
