A Second Christmas Morning: The Console Living Room 26 December 2013 For a generation of children, the most exciting part of a Christmas morning was discovering a large box under the tree, ripping it apart, and looking at an exciting, colorful box promising endless video games. At home! Right in your living room! The expansion of videogames from arcades, boardwalks and carnivals into the home was a vanguard mounted by companies with names like Coleco, Atari, Magnavox and Odyssey. For hundreds of dollars, you could play as many games as you wanted, for as long as you wanted, on the same TV you watched shows on. The change from the fireplace to television as center of home and hearth began in the 1950s and the home video game sped this process up considerably. Naturally, these home video games, running on underpowered hardware and not-made-for-the-purpose video screens, were scant competition in the graphics and experience department compared to arcade games. But as they improved, consoles and computer gaming dented and some would argue destroyed arcades as a nationwide phenomenon. Only a small percentage of arcades now exist compared to their peak. Sadly, the days of the home videogame console being a present under a tree followed by days of indulgent game-playing are not the same, replaced with massive launch events and overnight big-box store stays. Until today! In an expansion of the Historical Software Collection, the Internet Archive has opened the Console Living Room , a collection of console video games from the 1970s and 1980s. Like the Historical Software collection, the Console Living Room is in beta the ability to interact with software in near-instantaneous real-time comes with the occasional bumps and bruises. An army of volunteer elves are updating information about each of the hundreds of game cartridges now available, and will be improving them across the next few days. Sound is still not enabled, but is coming soon. Faster, more modern machines and up-to-date browsers work best with the JSMESS emulator. ... Hard Core Rikki Leaked video of Playstation 4 interface 08 Aug 2013 Gaming and Tech News [/gtech] It appears within the last 24 hours that leaked footage of the PS4 interface has appeared online. It seems to be from an early test kit, so the final version in stores may be slightly different. Nonetheless, it's pretty cool to see how it's going to look like.

Opinion: Oculus Ridiculous, My Take on the Oculus Rift 27 Jul 2013 Gaming and Tech News [/gtech] already have a Virtual Boy emulator now for Oculus Rift development kits . But, perhaps it was a fluke? Just poorly designed hardware for a damn good concept? At the moment, Sony and Microsoft seem to believe this, as we might see VR headsets in the near future with the XBOX ONE and PS4 . only game that fully supports it is Team Fortress 2 . Custom PC (UK Magazine) , you will need a hefty graphics card to run a game with Oculus Rift. Your GPU will have to be able to run the newest games at least at 60FPS with V-Sync and Stereoscopic 3D enabled. up this in the final consumer version, but there isn't even a release date set. right now at its full potential ... how much would it cost? Maybe... 2014 . if you use it for 3D porn, with penis sensor capabilities (I'm not joking) . [ ADDED : It's also very bothering with the reports of numerous people feeling nauseous / motion sickness [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] after limited (5-10 minutes) to extended usage of the Oculus Rift. The good news is Oculus VR (company behind Oculus Rift) has taken extensive note of this and has called upon game developers to try to work on adjusting their games accordingly to limit this , but even they admit it may be impossible to completely eradicate it.] Alpha 2013-07-26 New Files Added To Downloads Section 26 Jul 2013 1Emulation.com Information [/info] Our staff has been hard at work adding more emulators to our downloads section.
