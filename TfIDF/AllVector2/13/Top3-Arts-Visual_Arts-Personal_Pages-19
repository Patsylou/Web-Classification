Last Friday, while planning out a shoot w/ the photog, I made the off handed comment "I want to be INKED Girl of The Day!" - shoot on Saturday/Sunday was pretty fun. Fast Forward to this morning, some friends texted me while I was driving to work and sent messages on FaceBook to check the front page of Inked ... and, well... Awesome! I hosted a documentary screening (Hori Smoku Sailor Jerry) Sept 15, 2009 (if you can remember back that far) over at Roxie in the Mission. We had a little after party, too... overall it went quite well and a LOT of awesome ppl came through (over 700 RSVPs, the film was over capacity and the after party was off the CHAIN). So basically I hooked up my Brother from Another Mother as our photographer for the event. Here we are with party pooper 4.0 shot. (all official photos from this event are by AF3, except this first one of us by Allen M): DannyBoy - one of my sick ass tattooers - came through from Mom's. Check him out at his new chair - Let it Bleed Tattoo on Polk St (near Hemlock): Me D's "Mexican Soap Opera" photo: Uptown Erin: My new SFWeekly BFF Kevin: More pictures of me not being drunk (thank you to all tha Cabs DD's that took care of everyone this night, always make good choices): Oh and this is Saturday night (10/10) - Worked Make Out Room again and then headed to Delerium w/ JessicaG Spazzy Chris... Somedude : "Is that proper bar etiquette, painting your nails?" - Me : "I don't know... Everyone in here is too drunk to smell it. Who cares. I didn't have time at the other bar." I didn't get any good photos of my halloween costume from last year (interpretation of Sylvia Ji paintings of Katrinas) - Luckily Antonio wanted to shoot it so we recreated that mess and went for it. I'm only two photos in on the editing process so this is all you get for now. Photography by AF3 Studio. My dear Shrinkle has just put up a sneak peak PR image for her new cosmetics line, Sugarpill.
