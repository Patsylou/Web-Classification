DOS 3.3 (140K formats only); UniDOS, OzDOS (800K formats only); ProDOS; Apple Pascal (140K and 800K formats); SSI's RDOS (140K formats only); CP/M (probably only 140K formats). Raw disk data (dumps blocks or sectors without regard to file length or operating system storage); Binary file (dumps file without any conversion); Hex dump; ASCII file filter; Formatted assembly output; Pascal ".text" files; Applesoft BASIC file filter (file is de-tokenized and written out as a text file); Integer BASIC file filter (ditto); Graphic image file filter (supports black and white or color Hires images as well as black and white or color Double Hires images as well as standard Super Hires, and 3200 color Super Hires); AppleWorks word processor (AWP) file filter (converts to text, poor HTML, or Rich-Text Format (RTF)); AppleWorks database (ADB) file filter (converts to CSV); AppleWorks spread sheet (ASP) file filter (converts to CSV). Applesoft BASIC BASIC programs (Applesoft and Integer BASIC); Applesoft BASIC is colored Graphics images (same as supported by the graphics export function) Appleworks (database, spreadsheet, word processor) Text files (plain text, assembly source files, Pascal text files) Hex dump of all the above Issues If a disk is mostly in a known format, but has bad data and what-not, AppleCommander may crash. Technically, the worst culprit is a retrieving a non-existant block or track/sector. Various interface improvements. Requirement of a Java JVM as well as SWT for the interface. The Win32 (compiled) version of AppleCommander doesn't interpret graphic image colors correctly - however the Java JAR version does. tracker Future Requirements Java - If you need to install Java, go to the Sun Java SWT ! compiling Download Note: Please read the requirements and download Java and the SWT code, if required first!
