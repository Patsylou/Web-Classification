There are plans to actually rework some parts of the very old and rather messy codebase (especially in the user interface), a proper event system, use WTL properly implemented printer repeat bit image data (CHR$(26)) SHA/SHY/SHX improvement on page boundary crossing (unseen in any programs out in the wild so far) memory dump into text files added 192000 Hz sound frequency carriage return in printer bitmap mode fixed folder drive setting no longer reset when printer emulation gets enabled awkward crash in the monitor fixed bug in the debugger when breakpoint got disabled on ignored CPU crash opcodes minor memory map issue in true 1541/1581 drive emulation memory dump command in external monitor video recording glitch download 1.0.2 out now 22/8/2011 printer job window (for now #4 only) turn off variable length buffering properly when recording media (fixes occasional clicks) not scanning joysticks when unavailable (Message Queue driver slowdown) column width and line feed bug for MPS803 emulation fixed regression bug in the printer cycle counter ironed out awkward TED drawing bug patched download page New release 22/5/2011 homebrew user port lightpen support IEC drive directory mode now recognizes USR files (.USR extension) Win95 compatibility problem with the OPENFILENAME struct size fixed TED sound bug correction watchpoint & monitor fixes printer reverse mode bug fixed Plus4world website and pick this proggie: Lightpen-drawing_V3_0 Erroneous link fixed 13/1/2011 Yape 10 years old today 13/9/2010 32-bit and automatic bitdepth option in fullscreen mode (8 bit full screen mode might be slow under newer Windoze's) copy & paste to/from the clipboard now respects upper/lower case mode partially implemented 48 bps mode of the T6721A speech LSI G64 image support is no longer read only (yay, at last) reading from open address space plenty of bugfixes (drive, TED, autostart, monitor etc.) downloads section while it's still warm. Version 0.86 out 15/4/2010 This release brings two major changes. First, is the support for memory watchpoints (read, write, execute). Yep, at long last, another long outstanding feature (first requested around 2003 I guess. Oh well.). The other is a somewhat more intelligent autodetection of full screen resolution that also better respects the aspect ratio of newer TFT monitors. watchpoint support in external monitor maintain 4:3 aspect ratio in NTSC mode (DX only) autodetect best fullscreen mode based on preferences (stretching) extra lines threshold before screen flicker adjustable minor overall speed improvement couple of bugs ironed out in fullscreen mode page . Yape 0.85 23/1/2010 Another new year, another new Yape... however, I just realized that this time the emulator is turning 10 years old in September! Wohow... how time flies... I would have never imagined in the humble beginnings that it is turning to become what it is today, though if I did, I would have made sure it was progressing more rapidly :-) I hope I can squeeze out an anniversary edition and make it special in one way or another, though as I have a real busy real life, it may not even happen, so who knows for sure. here . Yape 0.84 out 3/10/2009 Now the summer hiatus is over, a small update to Yape is ready. Mainly tape related fixes/features but let us not forget the simple external assembler that is now added to the monitor and is available via the A (or .) command, just like for the good ole TEDMON. It could still be improved but for now it'll suffice I guess. It also supports illegal opcodes, of course. But here's the full log of what's been changed: implemented a simple assembler in the external monitor (yay, at last!) tape head adjust dialog for wave samples optionally invert tape sample input signal (soundcards may invert the phase while recording WAV's) tape fast forward and rewind in 15 sec steps TAP's with non-native encoding now supported (C64, VIC20 frequencies) bugfixes (sound, tape) Grab the appropriate build from here . Yape 0.83r2 for 64-bit Windows 8/6/2009 Please regrab your copy of the 64-bit version of Yape from here Yape 0.83 22/5/2009 A "semi" new release after having realized that VS 2008 does not support Win9x/NT platforms anymore and not everyone benefited from the profiler guided build either. So the ZIP package now contains two binaries: Win9x/NT binaries are being built in the old fashioned way with VS 2005 and the Vista/XP versions - and for modern processors - with VS 2008. Some new features have also sneaked in. Let's see what's new: SID card DigiBlaster (8bit DAC) support immediate exit on pressing F12 now optional separate build for Win9x machines occasional GCR data corruption problem fixed All this on the download page as always. Yape 0.82 21/4/2009 A new releases that fixes a couple of annoying as well as stupid bugs and introduces a significant performance leap. Here' the complete list of changes: unavailable full screen modes are greyed now executable generated with profile guided optimization (up to 30% speed increase) tape regression bugs fixed CPU level 1551 init bug ironed out CPU level 1581 got accidentally disabled since version 0.77 (oops) XP/Vista theme support back again to normal worked around a TED idle cycle read inaccuracy (regression bug since 0.72) Head on over to the download page and have fun with it. Yape 0.81 out at last 18/1/2009 Sheesh... almost a year has passed since the last version. Obviously, real life has taken over as being a daddy has higher priority than anything else on this world including emulation... :-) This not to mean the development of Yape has stopped just that I can not dedicate as much of my time to it as before. 2008 must have been the buiest year of my life ever... hope it'll get more relaxed in 2009. But let's get down to the nitty-gritty and see what little has been added to the emulator in the past months: permanent CPU watch frame in monitor window file association via the menu now works under Vista solved sound reset problem for save states ironed out a joystick setup bug (introduced in previous version) a few regression bugs fixed when recording to tape Additionally, I have built a native 64-bit Windows version this time as well, you can grab that if you have an x64 based Windows system. Eagle-eyed folks may have noticed that I have released an open source version recently, too. While the version number may only suggest a minor revision (0.32.5), it is actually closer to a 0.60-ish Windows build emulation-wise (except it lacks a couple of its features, yet). Check them out on my download page . Yape 0.80 released 22/3/2008 The second new release this year brings you a couple of improvements over the previous version. Gamers will appreciate the long outstanding joystick setup dialog features, while SID-card addicts may like the increased accuracy of the engine. new joystick setup dialog SID emulation improvements gamma correction fixes minor bugfixes this page for your copy as usual. Happy 2008 with Yape 0.79 :-) 17/1/2008 support for true interlace more new icons from Chronos couple of bugfixes here . Merry Xmas with Yape 0.78 25/12/2007 new fancy Vista ready icons (courtesy of Chronos) preliminary MPS802 printer emulation improved file association dialog bugfixes here . Yape 0.77 25/9/2007 MPS801/803 printer emulation very preliminary ACIA emulation a couple of configurability improvements decoder hue (tint control, mainly for NTSC) sound output settings T6721 and ACIA emulation selectable individually optional fast autostart for D64 files various minor bugfixes here . Version 0.76 out 31/7/2007 SID ADSR delay bug implemented (sounds way better!) many bugfixes here . Yape 0.75 29/6/2007 support for custom drive ROM images added parallelized 1541 drive emulation (both types) optional breakpoint opcode ($F2) couple of bugfixes (custom joystick keys etc.) here . Release 0.74 7/5/2007 dialog window for custom joystick controls customizable RAM startup patterns deadlock on SCRATCH-ing unclosed files fixed (IEC/D64) slightly improved SID filters improved mixing of audio channels regression TED bug fix in fast emulation level a couple of minor fixes here . Happy Easter with version 0.73 ! 9/4/2007 crash bug on saving tapes fixed some minor TED fixes in VHA mode other fixes here . New Yape release 12/3/2007 another new emulation level (VHA, very high accuracy) improved PAL-NTSC switch artifacts oversampling now also for the SID card selectable sound replay frequency more fullscreen mode options added support for test mode bug in the FIR filter fixed TED border flipflop check was 1 cycle off here .
