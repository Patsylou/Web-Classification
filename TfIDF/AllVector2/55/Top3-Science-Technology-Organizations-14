The researchers aligned the amino-acid sequences of a variety of copepod luciferases and identified frequently occurring amino acids, which were further rearranged on the basis of their unique idea, and developed a series of unique luciferases that are genetically distinctive from natural luciferases. They were named artificial luciferases (ALuc). ALuc were examined in a variety of assay systems making use of conventional luciferases. The results revealed that ALuc have advantages over any conventional luciferases in terms of enhancement in sensitivity, reduction of the measurement time, and light permeability in the tissues of living organisms. ALuc, as luminescent markers, will contribute to basic research in life science and are expected to contribute to a variety of diagnoses.
