 Close Ad " Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot stay in the cradle forever! " --Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky-- Introduction by Mark Somers Another avenue being investigated is a concept of nano robotics called "Swarms". Swarms are nano robots that act in unison like bees. They theoretically, will act as a flexible cloth like material and being composed of what's called Bucky tubes, this cloth will be as strong as diamond. Add to this cloth of nano machines nano computers and you have smart cloth. This smart cloth could be used to keep astronauts from bouncing around inside their spacecraft while they sleep, a problem that arises when the auto pilot computer fires the course correction rockets. The cloth like material will be able to offset the sudden movements and slowly move the sleeping astronaut back into position. Still another application for the nano robot swarms, being considered, is that the smart cloth could be used in the astronauts space suits. -- Benjamin Franklin -- Updated March 20 2004 Copyright Mark Somers All Rights Reserved
