Most players think that if they are open they should shoot. This is far from true. They should shoot only if they can shoot a good percentage from the spot. Getting players to buy in to the fact that they cannot shoot from a spot that other players are allowed to shoot from is a real coaching challenge. Some coaches take the easy way out and just let them shoot from anywhere. Such a way will lead to defeat. You must be tough and demand that the player shoot from positions he can shoot a high percentage. That is where shooting statistics can help the coach get the message across. Keeping an accurate shot chart is still a vital coaching tool, but I see a lot of teams that do not chart shots. Be sure to chart where each player shoots from and keep accurate shooting percentage charts. Be sure that you have a major problem when players are not sure what shot or shooting range is.

The majority of players will do a better job rebounding when they use blockout techniques. However, many of the quicker and better jumpers will not rebound as well when they concentrate on block out. hey tend to fail to jump for the ball. For these select players, it is better to move in front of their offensive opponent, then go get the ball. This was John Wooden's philosophy on his way to 10 national championships.

FIVE KEYS ON OFFENSE AND FIVE KEYS ON DEFENSE FOR BOTH THE COACH AND THE PLAYER OFFENSE: * Push the Pace * Get back on defense *One thing is very clear in the latter stages of a game when you are ahead: DON'T FOUL! This does not mean in the obvious situation--when you are ahead by three with seven seconds left for example when you might want to send your opponent to the line to prevent a 3 point attempt. Generally, late in the game, DON'T FOUL! (COACHING TIPS FROM DEL HARRIS) OTHER HALF COURT PLAYS Above play was used by PACIFIC UNIVERSITY INSIDE FEED FROM THE FLEX OFFENSE 1 advances ball to flex entry position. 4 cuts as if to receive the pass from 1 to initiate pass. Instead, he cuts away as shown and 1 skip passes to 3 who passes to 5 in the low post area. Of course, this option could be run from either side of the floor. If 4 was defended by a player in foul trouble for exampe, 1 would dribble to left entry position and after 5 cut up and back down, 1 would skip pass to 2 to feed to 4.
