The paper is about the testing and the applications of . not available. Sorry. A hardware random number generator pseudo-random 1997 web page pass the test but this does not good . Or your generator might fail not bad . electrical noise radioactive God really doesnt play dice http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits Protego Experimental design The major application is for encryption A generates a series of bits. I will say that they are if they have expectation 0.5 and are independent. I use the term uniform random n such bits interpreted as a binary number will be uniform n uniform random . For most purposes, we would like the bits (statisticians call them since a sequence of n uniform distribution n -1. Some people would describe the bits as being or completely random imperfectly or random.
