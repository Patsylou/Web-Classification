A larger amount of CO 2 2 2 3 - 2 2 2 R Most of the CO 2 2 2 with OH - 3 - ions. As the level of HCO 3 - 3 - 3 - - - and HCO 3 - 2 to HCO 3 - . Facilitated diffusion occurs in the movement of CO 2 3 - 2 . Excretion of CO 2 The second reason why most of the CO 2 2 + ) to be released. The increase in H + 3 - to form CO 2 - . Thus, more CO 2 + - 2 + 2 to HCO 3 - 2 from the tissues. Therefore, CO 2 B 2 + 2 2 2 3 - /Cl - 2 excretion to drop below CO 2 production, body CO 2 2 2 production, body CO 2 2 2 3 - with H + + 3 - with H + ions to form CO 2 2 + + influx and there is a HCO 3 - - + ions from the cells. 2 and CO 2 The components of the mammalian lung 2 Mammals Birds 2 Reptiles Frogs 2 2 2 CO2 Invertebrates Gills work 2 in, CO 2 2 2 content. The blood receiving the O 2 2 2 2 and CO 2 2 2 2 2 2 T B pattern generator and a CO2 Decreased O 2 2 2 levels may or may not come about with different O 2 2 In air, the levels of O 2 and CO 2 2 O2 2 2 for the tissues to use. A decrease in P O2 O2 2 eliminated and a reduction in blood P CO2 2 2 2 Increased CO 2 levels (hypercapnia) P CO2 represents the amount of CO 2 CO2 + 2 2 2 .
