We aim to bring together researchers who are interested in the molecular and cellular basis of disease. We promote scientific exchange at our annual conference, with an emphasis on providing constructive criticism in a friendly and supportive environment. We particularly support research students and researchers in the early stages of their careers. The Molecular and Experimental Pathology Society of Australasia (MEPSA) was formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of the Australasian Society for Experimental Pathology and the Australia New Zealand Environmental Mutagen Society. The current name was formalised in 2009. The Society is a broad church and our members interests include histopathology, cell biology, photobiology, genetics, inflammation, toxicology, cancer research, biochemical pathology, wound repair, immunology, veterinary pathology and more. Find out about membership, our recent and future conferences, travel support for attendance and our awards for young investigators!
