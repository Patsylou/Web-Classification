The Institutions that will jointly organize this event are the Institute for Technology of Nuclear and Other Mineral Raw Materials -ITNMS (Serbia) and the Faculty of Chemistry and Technology, University of Split (Croatia) along with the support of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia. Chairs of the Congress are Dr Aleksandra Daković, ITNMS (Serbia) and Dr Marina Trgo, University of Split (Croatia). LINK:  http://www.ktf-split.hr/zeolite2014/ Read more 8-13 June, 2014  --  Goldschmidt 2014: Sacramento, CALIFORNIA, US.  We would like to draw your attention to session 10h at the next Goldschmidt conference between June 8th and June 13th, 2014 in Sacramento. With our session "Zeolites and Glass Alteration Products: Formation and Stability in Alkaline Environments", the main scientific committee provided us with an opportunity to centralise all zeolite and glass alteration product related submissions in one Goldschmidt session with a specific focus to the formation of hydrated (alumino-) silicates in alkaline environments. This session aims at convening experts from relevant research fields (geochemistry, geology, materials science, civil engineering, spectroscopy) to confront and combine their latest insights. If we can make this first specific Goldschmidt session a success, we are convinced the geochemical society will provide us with a forum for interdisciplinary discussions on zeolites and high pH hydration/alteration products for several years to come.  The on-line abstract submission is already open, please be aware that the deadline for abstract submission is February the 8th. A special issue in Mineralogical Magazine will be prepared with the work submitted to the session. LINK:  http://goldschmidt.info/2014/ 1-5 September, 2014 -- IMA 2014: Gauteng, SOUTH AFRICA.  We are pleased to invite you to the scientific session *Zeolites and porous materials* (Theme: Economic Geology/Mineralogy, Applied Mineralogy).***  Brief description of the session. This session covers the crystal-chemistry of both natural and syntheticmicro and mesoporous phases, as well as their utilizations, synthesis, properties, and occurrence. In Material Science, investigations aiming to obtain new types of porous materials, inspired by the mineral structures, have opened an essential field of research. These phases are represented by zeolites and zeo-type materials, with purely tetrahedral frameworks, and by heteropolyhedral framework compounds. Zeolites represent a class of well-known minerals and materials with a high potential for industrial utilization. Classical fields are detergent additives, catalysts in cracking processes of the petroleum refining industry and as molecular sieves in environmental applications, soil improvement and nuclear waste treatment. Recent innovative applications of zeolites regard their use as host matrices for a large variety of guests. These hybrid materials can be exploited in several research fields, as devices for solar energy harvesting, processing/storing of information, and advanced sensing technology for analytics and diagnostics on the nanoscale. Many microporous heteropolyhedral compounds, containing metals such as Mo, V, Sn, Zr, Ti, Ca and lanthanides, with a wide number of distinct structural types, have been reported and their potential applications in the areas of catalysis, separation of molecular species, ion exchange and optical and magnetic devices have been evaluated. We expect contributions on mineralogy, structure, P-T stability, crystal-chemistry and applications of natural and related synthetic porous phases, and hence from mineralogy and petrology researchers as well as from crystallographers and material scientists. The scheduled key-note speaker is Sergey Krivovichev. *The deadline for Abstract submission is 28 February 2014.* LINK:  http://www.ima2014.co.za/ 5–10 July, 2015 -- Euroclay2015: University of Edinburg, UK . The scientific program of EUROCLAY 2015 will bring together, in an exciting, leading-edge programme, specialists from different disciplines related to clays and clay minerals. It will consist of technical sessions of both oral and poster presentations with a generous quota of invited speakers who are the leaders in their respective fields. Pre-meeting workshops and mid-meeting field excursions will be integral parts of the scientific program.   A key aim of this conference will be to integrate industrial and academic workers, with sessions which cover both areas.  A visit to Edinburgh is one of life's 'must-do' items. As Scotland's capital city, it is the home of geology and is littered with places of interest for the delegate and accompanying person alike LINK: http://www.Euroclay2015.org Subscribe Socorro Sofia Salonicco © 2011 by International Natural Zeolite Association | Please contact INZA Webmaster with comments/suggestions. porno porn siki rokettube siki gen porno porno porno izle porn
