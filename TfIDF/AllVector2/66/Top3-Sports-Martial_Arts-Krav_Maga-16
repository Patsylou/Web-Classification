 Krav Maga Because it is an art designed for everyone, Krav Maga teaches never to use strength vs. strength, to always strike vulnerable targets, and that for every defense there must also be an offense. Practitioners learn to defend themselves against attackers both unarmed and armed (including defenses against sticks, knives and guns) as well as against multiple attackers. Proper training requires physical and mental concentration and commitment. The Krav Maga NYC school has been in existence for over 20 years - it was founded in 1990. The Krav Maga Federationtraces its lineage from Krav Maga founder Imi Lichtenfeld and Grandmaster Haim Zut to Rhon Mizrachi. kravmagainfo@yahoo.com
