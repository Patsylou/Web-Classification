VanCise 02-23-2014, 12:32 PM Balintawak (5 Viewing) The Great Grandmaster Anciong Bacon is widely acknowledged as the original master of Balintawak Arnis/Eskrima. In Balintawak Arnis, the stick is used as the primary training tool. The theory is that the stick is only an extension of the arm and that the human body can only move in so many normal ways. In Balintawak, the student is taught that there is a counter to every counter and that continuous research and discovery is the basis of knowledge.

He classified the styles he learned into their respective ranges, from long (largo) to medium (medio) to short (corto), and came up with the name of his system, an acronym of the ranges. In April of 1997, Edgar Sulite was felled by a stroke while on a trip to the Philippines, at the young age of thirty-nine.

Guro Dave Gould 01-23-2014, 01:22 AM Lightning Scientific Arnis (3 Viewing) A system founded in 1937 by Grandmaster Benjamin Luna-Lema. The system is composed of the Tercia, Cadenilla, Serrada and Espada Y Daga styles. It is known for its powerful, fluid, and fast strikes; its preference for "blind-siding" the opponent; and its focus on the stick and knife. An important principle in Lightning is closing with the opponent and 'blanketing' them with multiple strikes. Grandmaster Lema would say, "If he gives me one strike, I give him fifteen. Even if he does not give me one strike,I give him fifteen." The system is now headed by his daughter Patty-Jean Lema Caballero.
