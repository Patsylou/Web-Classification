What We Are About High Flyers Trampoline Gymnastics Academy (High Flyers) is a family owned and orientated club run in Wangara, Western Australia.

Whilst we pride ourselves in producing high quality Trampoline (TRP), Tumbling (TUM) programs, as well as Women’s Gymnastics (WG), and Men’s Gymnasts (MG), our ultimate goal is to: Create a safe, positive and friendly environment, where we can nurture the personal development of each individual athlete. To develop confidence, teamwork, determination and physical well being for all athletes. Attributes that will go on to serve our athletes well into their adult years. To promote discipline, dedication and strong work habits in order to help each athlete reach their goals. To provide a quality team of administrative and coaching staff in order to deliver a high level of service. Club Philosophy High Flyers aims to provide a safe and positive learning environment whilst providing programs which meet the recreational, physical, cultural and social needs of the local community.
