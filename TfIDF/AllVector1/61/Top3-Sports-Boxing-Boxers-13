Then, when he was eligible for the Senior championships, he stepped up to the 91kg heavyweight class and added even more titles to his collection. In 2006 he lost to Danny Price . The 27-year-old, a three-time ABA heavyweight champion, is hoping to emulate the feats of his home city's most famous fighter, John Conteh. Like Bellew, Conteh was an ABA champ, before winning British, Commonwealth, European and WBC titles at 175 pounds. And Conteh has even backed Bellew to match his achievements, revealing that he will be keeping a close eye on his career. "John is a big hero of mine, one of the best fighters to have come out of the UK, if not the best, and I'd love to go on and achieve what he did," said Bellew. "To be talked about in the same breath as him is pretty amazing. I've met him a few times and he's a great guy, although I'm not sure he knew who I was! Once I start winning titles, hopefully that will all change." Bellew, who fought out of the world famous Rotunda ABC as an amateur, did not start boxing until he was 17. Of 47 amateur fights, he won 40, 32 inside the distance, and earned the nickname "The Bomber" because of his punching power. And he is hoping that power will transfer to the professional ranks. "It's going to be tough getting down to light-heavyweight having always fought as a heavyweight, but it's even worse news for my opponents," said Bellew. "There will be a few guys with a high ranking who are going to get knocked out. "The light-heavyweight division in the UK is not as talented as others, so I can definitely make an impact. Bellew, trained by former WBU middleweight champion Anthony Farnell, isn't all about brawn though - he trained as an accountant while an amateur, although he now plans to put his career in finance on hold. "I'm not your average boxer," he said. "I've already got plans for where I'm going to invest my money, and my financial background will come in handy when it comes to making investment decisions. "I want to provide a good future for my sons Corey and Cobey, and as you don't earn money for overtime in this sport the plan at the moment is to get in and out of the ring as quickly as possible to maximise my earning potential." Amateur Record: 40–7. Professional career [ edit ] Bellew made his professional boxing debut on 6 October 2007 against journeyman Jamie Ambler and made a winning start with a second round win. He followed up the victory with further wins in 2007 over Adam Wilcox, fighting at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and Wayne Brooks at the Bolton Arena . [ 2 ] In 2008 Bellew defeated Paul Bonson, Ayitey Powers, Hastings Rasani, Jevgenijs Andrejevs and Phil Goodwin to take his record up to 8–0. During 2009 he advanced to an unbeaten 12–0 with further wins against the likes of Matthew Ellis, Nick Okoth, Jindrich Velecky and Martial Bella Oleme. [ 2 ] Commonwealth Champion [ edit ] On 12 March 2010 Bellew challenged for the vacant Commonwealth title at light heavyweight beating Atoli Moore at the Echo Arena in Liverpool . [ 3 ] He made his first defence of the title on 24 September 2010 winning a hard fought victory against Bob Ajisafe at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London's Mayfair with Bellew having to recover from a flash knockdown during the fight. [ 1 ] He made his second defence of the title on 9 December 2010, returning to the Echo Arena to stop former Commonwealth champion Ovill McKenzie in the 8th round despite suffering two knockdowns himself in the fight in both the 1st and 2nd rounds. [ 4 ] On 18 May 2011 it was announced that Bellew would challenge Nathan Cleverly for the WBO light heavyweight title following a pullout from Cleverly's scheduled opponent Jürgen Brähmer with the fight due to be held only three days later on the 21 May 2011. Bellew however, failed to make the weight and was replaced with Polish boxer Aleksy Kuziemski . [ 5 ] On 16 July 2011 Bellew made the third defence of his Commonwealth title and also won the vacant British belt with a repeat victory over Ovill McKenzie , with the bout this time lasting the full 12 rounds. [ 2 ] World Title Challenge [ edit ] It was announced that Bellew would fight Nathan Cleverly in Liverpool , on 15 October 2011, for the WBO light heavyweight title. For the first two rounds, the fight started at a ferocious pace, with Bellew rocking Cleverly in the second round. As the fight carried on, Cleverly's boxing skills came through to wear down the resistance of Tony Bellew. Cleverly won the fight via majority decision. One judge scored the bout at 114–114 whereas the other two judges scored the bout at 117–112 and 116–113. Road Back to World Title Contention [ edit ] After losing to Nathan Cleverly Bellew took on Danny McIntosh for the vacant British Light Heavyweight Title knocking McIntosh out in the 5th Round. Next he took on former World title challenger Edison Miranda for the WBC International belt. He stopped Miranda in the 9th Round. On 17 November 2012 he beat highly rated Argentine Roberto Bolonti for the WBC silver title. Bellew was cut badly but went the full 12 rounds to a win unanimous decision, taking him one step further to a second world title fight. On 30 March 2013, he fought Malawian boxer Isaac Chilemba in a title eliminator. Bellew started very well, but Chilemba raised his game in the later rounds. Although many felt Bellew had done enough to secure a points decision, the judges scored it a controversial draw. Chilemba granted a rematch which Bellew won on points. Bellew was made Mandatory Challenger for the WBC Light Heavyweight Title following the win against Chilemba. However a fight between Adonis Stevenson and Tavoris Cloud occurred on 28 September 2013 with the winner being made to defend his title against Bellew before the end of the year. Stevenson won the fight after Cloud retired after 7 rounds. Bellew subsequently lost to Stevenson via 6th round TKO on 30 November 2013 at the Colisée Pepsi , Quebec City . After this, he announced his intention to fight at cruiserweight .
