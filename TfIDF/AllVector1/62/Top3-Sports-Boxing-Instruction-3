As with most kids Rocky was the reason I got involved in the sport of boxing. Every time I would watch one of the movies I would find myself outside training to the soundtrack. What fascinated me the most was Rocky's pure determination to go the extra round. Even more impressive was the shape that Sylvester Stallone was in for the movies. It would not sink in until much later that boxing and conditioning is hard work. Everyone wants to either learn how to throw a punch or dodge one. However there is far more to boxing, such as getting your body ready and conditioned for what boxing is about to do to it.  Here you will learn the basics of boxing, from how to throw the common jab, cross, and hook, to learning proper form for push-ups, squats, pull-ups and chin-ups.
