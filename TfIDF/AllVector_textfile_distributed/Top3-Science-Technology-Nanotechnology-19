Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), such as actuators, sensors and resonators, rely on the interactions between multiple physical effects. In this webinar, we will show how a multiphysics simulation approach allows you to combine electrical, thermal and structural effects accurately in order to design reliable and high-performance MEMS devices. COMSOL Multiphysics Materials for Semiconductor Manufacturing Dec 18 at 1 p.m. EST. Success in electronics manufacturing increasingly relies on the materials used in production and packaging. In this webcast, experts will focus on changing material requirements, the evolving material supply chain, recent advances in process and packaging materials and substrates, and the role new materials such as carbon nanotubes will play in the future. Linde Next Generation Metrology and Inspection Nov 21 at 2 PM ET . Continued scaling and more complex device structures, including FinFETs and 3D stacking, are creating new challenges in metrology and inspection. Smaller defects must be detected and analyzed on an increasingly diverse set of materials. Chip makers are looking for better wafer edge inspection techniques, higher resolution metrology tools, 450mm-capability and new compositional analysis solutions. Experts will describe new approaches for next generation metrology and inspection, including measurements of CDs, stress, film thickness and non-visual defects.
