L'atmosphre: morologie populaire by Camille Flammarion (1888) The schedule of our lives is shaped by the movements of the earth, moon, and sun. In ancient Rome, a priest observed the sky and announced a new moon cycle to the king. For centuries afterward, Romans referred to the first day of each new month as Kalends (from their word calare , which means "to proclaim). The word calendar derived from this custom.
