Freddie Roach was named the BWAA trainer of the year. The problem with Roach winning that award is there were, at minimum, three and possibly five trainers who accomplished more in 2013 than Freddie Roach did.Here are the trainers who were more deserving than roach of Trainer of the Year honors for 2013: FEBRUARY 24, 2014 BOXINGTALK'S KO FIX: AMIR IMAM SENDS JARED ROBINSON OUT OF THE RING In Cleveland on Showtime's ShoBox broadcast, Amir Imam registered his twelfth consecutive knockout in the fourth round with a brutal straight right that sent Jared Robinson through the ropes and out of the ring.

By Rob Soucy With Floyd Mayweather on the verge of announcing an opponent forhis May 3rd pay-per-view show, the boxing world continues to debatewho is more worthy ofgetting the lucrative opportunity to face the sport's pound-for-pound best. Will it be Amir Khan of the United Kingdom or Marcos Maidana of Argentina? With the fight still 11 weeks away, it seems like there is a good possibility that Mayweather and Showtime are waiting for next Friday night to make the announcement live on air.On that night,Mayweather Promotions will put on SHowtime;s ShoBox event in upstate New York, headlined by JLeon Love vs. Vladine Biosse. Maywaether could very well be in attendance to make the announcement in front of Showtime;s carmera. Healso couldmake the announcement on Monday, February 24th, which happens to be his 37th birthday. FEBRUARY 22, 2014 ZOU SHIMING NOW 4-0 WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE IN CHINA Zou Shiming KO7 Yokthong Kokietgym ... In Macao, China, former Olympic champion Zou Shiming put on a stromg performance, getting his first professional stoppage in his fourth pro bout. The 32 year-old flyweight from China floored a nineteen year-old Thai named Yokthong Kokietgym three times en route to a seventh-round stoppage. Yokthong has a still-impressive record at 15-4, but nearly all of his wins came against undocumented opponents. Shiming is now 4-0 and his promoter, Top Rank, may have located an easy path to a world title: the vacant IBF flyweight title was recently claimed by the undistinguished Amnat Ruenroeng of Thailand. Shiming would be a favorite to beat Ruenrong despite having never fought more than seven rounds. source: global post FEBRUARY 22, 2014 AMIR IMAM SENDS OPPONENT OUT OF RING ON SHOBOX Amir Imam TKO4 Jared Robinson... In the ShoBox opener from Cleveland, Amir Imam registered his twelfth consecutive knockout in the fourth round with a brutal straight right that sent Jared Robinson through the ropes and out of the ring.Robinson applied pressure in the opening rounds, leaving himself open to power shots that Imam, a junior welterweight from Albany, New York, continually landed to back up Robinson against the ropes in the small ring. In the fourth, Imam (13-0, 12 KOs) landed a left combo that staggered Robinson, followed by the vicious straight right that sent Robinson out of the ring. Robinson (14-1, 6 KOs) appeared to fall on his head near the water bucket in Imams corner but he beat the twenty count, making it into the ring at eleven. However, he unsteady as he climbed back in to the ring so referee Jim Howe halted the bout. He was off balance so I think it was a good stoppage, Imam said. If the ref didnt stop it then I would have just had to stop him on my own.Robinson, who said he felt fine in his locker room following the knockout, didnt disagree with Howes decision.My eyes were never closed but I was rocking myself back and forth to climb back in the ring, Robinson said. It probably would have taken me a few more rounds to get my wits back but I was back in the ring in time. source: showtime press release FEBRUARY 22, 2014 LUNDY WINS BIG IN CLEVELAND By Scott Shaffer Hank Lundy W10 Angelo Santana...

He didnt surprise me; it was just an off night. m disappointed but Ill be back. source: shobox FEBRUARY 21, 2014 KHAN THINKS MAYWEATHER WILL FIGHT MAIDANA A frustrated Amir Khan thinks he's lost the chance to fight Floyd Mayweather on May 3rd because, he believes, Mayweather has decided to fight WBA welterweight titlist Marcos Maidana instead. Khan foolishly pulled out of an IBF welterweight title challenge of Devon Alexander in December, afraid he might lose to Alexander and blow a chance at Mayweather. Instead, Khan has wasted nearly a year of his prime. Khan took to Twitter to complain: "No response from Mayweather or his team. Fights not happening. I should of taken the title fight last December against Alexander...Can I apologies [apologize] to the thousands of people who are let down. You me and everyone wanted the Mayweather fight. He's running scared. Good luck to Maidana, against mayweather." Mayweather asked boxing fans to pick between Maidana and Khan, and more voted for Khan, a result that Khan thinks is going to be ignored. --Scott Shaffer FEBRUARY 21, 2014 GLEN JOHNSON POSTS VICTORY IN RHODE ISLAND Rob Soucy@ringside Glen Johnson TKO4 Jaime Velazquez... A fight that looked to be a gross mismatch going in turned out to be a decent scrap for the first two rounds. The result, however, was exactly what was expected. Former world light heavyweight champion Glenn Johnson improved to 54-18 with a solid performance against overmatched Jaime Velazquez. The 45 year-old Johnson controlled the action with constant pressure and a work rate that overwhelmed the 42 year-old Velazquez (11-6-2). Velazquez stole the first round with his jab but both fighters looked their age. Johnson picked up the pace in the second round and started to land his trademark overhand right. By the third, Johnson was in complete control and the end was near. He hurt Velazquez early with a looping right hand and kept the pressure on with combinations. Velazquez was all but out on his feet when his corner stopped the fight. Johnson looked like a shell of himself despite the fairly easy win but said he can win another world title. "I want to fight for the light heavyweight championship of the world," said Johnson. "My preference would be an opportunity to avenge my defeat against Bernard Hopkins but I'll fight any of the champions, (Adonis) Stevenson, (Sergei) Kovalev or (Beibut) Shumenov." Toka Kahn-Clary KO2 Carlos Fulgencio... After feeling out his opponent for a round, Providence featherweight Toka Kahn-Clary turned up the heat in the second round with a vicious body attack. He dropped Carlos Fulgencio (19-13-1) three times, each time due to a left hand to the body. The fight was stopped after the third knockdown. Kahn improved to 10-0 and has top-level skills and hand speed. Fulgencio, the loser of eight in a row, was not in the same class as Kahn-Clary, who is now on the cusp of a meaningful fight as New England's top prospect.

Almost as significant as the fight itself is the fact that Kahn-Clary is in the process of dropping down from junior lightweight (130 pounds) tofeatherweight (126). Considered one of, if not the top prospect in New England right now, Kahn-Clary weighed in at 127 on Thursdayand said he feels strong. Despite having lost his last seven fights, Fulgencia has been in the ring with some top opposition most notablyJessie Magdaleno, Patrick Hyland and ex-champion Abner Mares earlier in his career.

"I have to get him on TV, this kid can fight," said Kahn-Clary's head trainer Peter Manfredo Sr. "ESPN or Shobox, he's ready!" Kahn-Clary is also tentatively scheduled to fight on March 29th at the Texas Station Casino in Las Vegas. The rumored opponent is Chazz McDowell(6-4, 1 KO).

As the video below shows, Morrison has a long way to go before rivalling the accomplishments of his father, who briefly held the WBO heavyweight title after defeating George Foreman.

By Ben Dean Ben, What's your early take on [the proposed but not scheduled fight between] Mikey Garcia vs. Yuriorkis Gamboa? Is Mikey the real deal? Has Gamboa wasted his prime? This is a very intriguing fight to me, because it will tell a story and define these two fighters at this stage of their career. I loved watching Gamboa come up on Friday Night Fights and his early jump to HBO. He sought and destroyed his opponents, taking risk for entertainment in the process.
