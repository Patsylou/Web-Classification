Welcome to PombeNet, and to the Forsburg Lab! Molecular & Computational Biology Section in the Dept of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, CA. Our research examines the links between DNA replication, cell cycle, and chromosome dynamics in a model genetic system: the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Our work uses a combination of classical genetics and state of the art imaging methods to expore mechanisms of genome stablity .
