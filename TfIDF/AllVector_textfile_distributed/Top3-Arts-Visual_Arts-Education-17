BA Presidential Scholarships in the Arts MA Combined BA/MA MFA The Department of Fine Arts and Art History seeks to interweave creative expression, art theory, and history. The strong partnership between the Fine Arts and Art History promotes our critical approach, which is grounded in both contemporary and historical concerns. We challenge our students to think beyond the classroom, to interpret the arts within a broader visual culture, treating the classroom as a testing ground for their ideas. The Department offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in Fine Arts, Art History, or a combination of the two as well as a Master of Fine Arts and a Master of Arts in Art History. Undergraduate and graduate students have a range of options for studying the visual and creative arts and for developing visual literacy as well as critical, analytic, and research skills.
