 The Fighter's Factory Home Boxing Circuit Gallery Contact Us Videos Fight Night Register   Print The gym works in a way so that everyone gets what they want out of it, whether it be to box competitively, lose weight and get fit or to learn some self defence. Men and women of all ages are welcome to train here. Naturally, people who train regularly will be shown more than those who train on a casual basis. However, people who want to have a whack on the bags every now and then are just as welcome. Don’t expect personalised attention when you first start training, this will come to those who show dedication and commitment. Nothing goes unnoticed. Finally, please respect the equipment. The speed balls and floor to ceiling balls are for speed, timing and accuracy not power punching. So keep you head down, hands up and train hard. Welcome To Daily boxing circuits, as well as one-on-one personal training available. Drop into the gym and see us at 3-5 Blackburn Rd, Blackburn , or give us a call on (03) 9877 7344 .
