This year, were privileged to hold our signature event ~ An Evening in Olde Newport ~ at one of Newports most interesting summer cottages, Marble House. A National Historic Landmark, it was built between 1888 and 1892 as a summer house for Mr. and Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt. But Marble House was much more; it was a social and architectural landmark that set the pace for Newports subsequent transformation from a quiet summer colony of wooden houses to the legendary resort of opulent stone palaces. Were excited to share an evening of living history as we journey back into the heyday of Newport society. Due to the limited seating area in the Marble House ballroom, this unique opportunity is offered to our first eighty conference registrants. Confirmations will be included with your registration receipt. For more information regarding Marble House, click here .
