If you want to know why people cross the road at the zebra-crossing, or why they believe in witchcraft, or why some groups sanction marriage between cousins and others not, you ask an anthropologist.They study how people adapt to their environment (or adapt their environment to them) , how they organise their societies, and the shared systems of meaning and belief that they develop. Anthropologists gather this information by observing and talking to people.
