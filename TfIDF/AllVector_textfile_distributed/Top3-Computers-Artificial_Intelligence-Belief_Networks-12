With the proliferation of Cloud-connected smart edge devices such as smartphones, producers and consumers of many feed-following applications reside on edge devices and the Cloud. An important design goal of such applications is to minimize communication (and energy) overhead of edge devices. In this paper, we...

Data scientists typically manually extract samples of increasing data size (progressive samples) using domain-specific sampling strategies for exploratory querying. This provides them with user-control, repeatable semantics, and result provenance. However, such solutions result in tedious workflows that preclude the reuse of work across samples. On the...

The first survey solicited questions that software engineers would like data scientists to investigate about software, about software processes and practices, and about software engineers. Our analyses resulted in a list of 145 questions grouped into 12 categories. The second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145 questions and identify the most important ones to...

We revisit the problem of sorting and merging data in main memory, and show that a long-forgotten technique called Patience Sort can, with some key modifications, be made competitive with today’s best comparison-based sorting techniques for both random and almost sorted data. Patience sort consists of two phases: the creation of sorted runs, and the merging of these runs. Through a...

Nori, Sriram K. Rajamani, and Selva Samuel Probabilistic programs use familiar notation of programming languages to specify probabilistic models. Suppose we are interested in estimating the distribution or expectation of a return expression r of a probabilistic program P. We are interested in slicing the probabilistic program P and obtain a simpler program SLI(P) which retains only those parts of P that are relevant to estimating r, and elides those parts P that are not relevant to estimating r. We desire that the SLI transformation be both correct...

This work can be tedious at times, and also difficult to learn and to supervise. Serious games have the potential to make these tasks more interesting and engaging. The process of turning a task or learning activity into a game acts to clarify and regularize the work, making it easier for people to learn and perform the task.

We investigate techniques for boosting the accuracy of automatic phonetic segmentation based on HMM acoustic-phonetic models. In prior work we were able to improve on state-of-the-art alignment accuracy by employing special phone boundary HMM models, trained on phonetically segmented training data, in conjunction with a simple boundary-time correction model.
