In Erlangen, materials science innovation starts at the atomic level and influences the entire process chain to achieve macroscopically visible results. Video The Cluster of Excellence Engineering of Advanced Materials – Hierarchical Structure Formation for Functional Devices (EAM) is the only interdisciplinary research collaboration of its type in Germany to focus on the investigation of functional materials and their processing at all length scales. Its research centers on the fundamental and applied aspects of designing and creating novel high-performance materials. Situated at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) it is part of the Excellence Initiative of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG), Germany's largest research funding organization.
