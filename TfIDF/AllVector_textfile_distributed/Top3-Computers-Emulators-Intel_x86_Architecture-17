Personally, it is the facial hair that I have a problem. So I bought a no no on ebay (used) and I use it strictly for a little over three months. Honestly, the hair on my face disappeared more than half and the hairs that grow back are finer. At first, it is true the NONO Hair Removal Product that we saw the black hair cut flush on my face, but as and applications, it finally disappeared leaving a net face. I said that I was waxing takes 2 minutes three times per week for 3 weeks, then 1 time a week and now its once a fortnight (and again, because I am a stickler).
