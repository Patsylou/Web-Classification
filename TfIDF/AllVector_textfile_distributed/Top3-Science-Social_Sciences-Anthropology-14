The Department caters for practical music, music education and musicology, thus uniting fields of study that in Europe would be divided between university and conservatory. Besides offering tuition in all the usual instruments of Western art music, we are placing increasing emphasis on the study and performance of indigenous African music, jazz and popular styles. Our BMus and BA (Mus) programmes offer tuition in all these styles. The Department also offers the only Music Therapy programme on the continent (at master's level). Head of the Music Department: Prof Wim Viljoen .
