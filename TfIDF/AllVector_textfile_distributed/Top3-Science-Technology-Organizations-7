THE INTERNATIONAL CAST POLYMER ASSOCIATION recently merged with the AMERICAN COMPOSITES MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. Although the ICPA has been absorbed by ACMA, the organization still retains its desire to be visible, in certain ways, as a separate entity within the larger organization. A goal of its discrete membership is to achieve awareness of cast polymer products with a special consumer target base. We're moving ahead with our new Marketing Initiative!
