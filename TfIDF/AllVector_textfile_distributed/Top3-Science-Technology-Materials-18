Research Synthetic polymers enable cheap, efficient, durable alkaline fuel cells By creating several variations of membranes and studying them under similar conditions, the research team can predict the most optimal structure in an active and stable fuel cell. Prototypes for Adjustable Space Mirrors Researchers report progress on deformable, thin, light-weight mirror segments for the proposed SMART-X mission, a space-based X-ray telescope with 30 times the effective light-capturing area as the Chandra X-ray Observatory. FEI Titan dual aberration corrected S/TEM The Titan has a high speed remote control which removes even the operator from the instrument environment, a change that will be welcomed by most operators. The Sound of One Wing Flapping At Penn State, faculty in electrical and mechanical engineering and their graduate students have spent the past two years working at an even smaller scale than a nano air vehicle (NAV), called the pico air vehicle (PAV), based on insect flight. Bioinspiration, Biomimetics, and Bioreplication Three closely related ideas with different names make up one of the fastest growing fields in science and engineering. Microencapsulation produces uniform drug release vehicle Microencapsulation produces uniform drug release vehicle. Biomedical Materials and Devices Materials of all kinds, but especially nanomaterials, are being exploited for image enhancement, drug delivery, wound healing, electronic/photonic/fluidic devices for diagnosis and therapy, and regenerative medicine. Electronic/Photonic Materials and Devices New and still largely theoretical areas of research active at Penn State include plasmonics, spintronics, and metamaterials. Polymeric Systems Polymer research crosses many disciplinary boundaries, including chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, bioengineering, and medicine. Interdisciplinary Research at Penn State A strong group of faculty researchers are working across boundaries to solve important scientific and societal problems in five broad areas of interdisciplinary materials research. Nanomaterials, Nanostructures, and Nanofabrication At Penn State, nearly one hundred research groups are engaged in high-impact science and engineering at the nanoscale. Penn State is one of only 14 university members of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN). Penn State: Inspiring Researchers Nanoscience View how Jim Adair and his team at Penn State are tansforming the way we treat and detect cancer through their nanoscience research with a new drug delivery and imaging system utilizing nanojackets. Materials, Processes, and Tools At Penn State, we have faculty whose primary focus is metals, ceramics, glass, powder processing, laser welding, microwave processing, mechanical testing, materials characterization, modeling and simulation. Publications NEW Booklet: Materials Research Institute At Penn State, many researchers have the support of both their academic departments and the university-wide institutes, such as MRI. By encouraging crosscutting research, MRI and its sister institutes open up traditional silos of knowledge to the stimulus of other viewpoints and new ideas. Read more...
