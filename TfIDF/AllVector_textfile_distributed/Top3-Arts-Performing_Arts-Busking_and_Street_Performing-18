 This video is an exploration of motion and type effects inspired by the topic of . It was created in Apple's Motion 4 from a design brief suggested by my friend and co-worker David Thomas. I combined various elements from Motion's built in content along with filters from the FX Factory's plug-in. A number of the scenes also use animated cameras in Motion to give some added excitement to the animations. Over the school holidays in June 2011, the kids and I put together this clip by shooting mostly stills but also a bit of video on my Canon IXUS 60 and editing in Final Cut Pro after converting the image sequences to ProRes via Quicktime 7. The song is Black Water Gold by African Music Machine. Don't get too confused though, only three of the fours kids belong to me. Child number four just happened to be playing at our house that day so was happy to get involved. For our family christmas card for 2010, the kids helped out with the artwork and we all assembled this piece together in Apple's Motion 4. The music of course is Linus and Lucy by Vince Gauraldi which comes from my favourite TV Christmas show of all time, Charlie Brown's Christmas. Get the song Linus and Lucy on iTunes
