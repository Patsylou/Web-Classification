Read more About ThreeDify .   Testimonials   Rio Tinto ( http://www.riotinto.com ) A leading international mining company embeded ThreeDify OctSolid , a 64-bit Linear Octree Library, in one of their in-house software solutions.   Ben Connor, Exploration Coordinator / G.I.S. Dept. Manager, Riverside Resources Inc.( http://www.rivres.com ) "As a company that evaluates a number of different projects at various stages of exploration, we ( Riverside Resources Inc. ) have been seeking a more affordable approach to being able to accurately make in house assessments on more advanced stage projects with drilling data for possible acquisition. After a few upgrades to the software that incorporated the items that we have requested, we have been able to run accurate in house assessments on a number of advanced stage projects to get a better idea of what potential exists and what is already discovered. GeoModeler is relatively easy to use, and can handle large amounts of data and run effective block model processing techniques to determine realized mineral assets and potential upside. We have been very impressed with the constant evolution of your product and incorporating our needs into your new releases. We have also been very impressed with the level of service and support provided by your support engineer. There has not yet been a situation where we have felt dissatisfied by your product and would definitely recommend to other exploration companies seeking a more affordable alternative to other resource modelling software available on the market."   Sarel Blaauw, CEO,Tacmin Madini ( http://www.tacmin.co.za ) "During the last quarter of 2011, following fifteen years of consulting listed mining companies on multi-commodity open pit mining projects across sub-Saharan Africa, Tacmin Madini's expertise was challenged with a severe workload that with others involved pit optimisations of 16 open pit mining projects. Now withstanding deadlines from a number of clients, the resistance to change from pit optimisers, and familiarisation with new software and the unknowns, I decided to apply ThreeDify’s Flowpit parallel with other optimisers used by the company. In less than one month, I was confident thattogether with Flowpit andthe solid backup and support of the ThreeDify team, we were fully capable of conforming to Tacmin’s daunting requirements, and in less than three months, we were able to: Interface ThreeDify software into all mining software in use by the company. Execute pit optimisations with large block models and multiple variables in the shortest possible time. Have unlimited control over reporting capabilities.   Giulio Morandini, MBA,Commercial planning manager, Gas Power Division, ENI.S.P.A "I have been using ThreeDify Excel Grapher to implement a visual control system for data points outliers, and have been impressed by the software functionality. The 3D surface plot suited my needs perfectly. I also found the technical support to be great. I rarely find somewhere else with such a fast and helpful communication as ThreeDify . I'll be sure to recommend this product whenever I have a chance."   Terry Grapentine,President,Grapentine Company LLC "I have been using ThreeDify Excel Grapher for several months now and have been impressed not only with this software but also the support I’ve received from the company.

Being able to rotate the diagram gives the image a real 3D-feel and provides my clients an intuitive understanding of the statistical relationships I investigated for them. The few times I’ve had questions with the software, I’ve received quick responses to my emails—and even a phone call once to help me with a particularly sticky issue I was having."   Lei Yu, Ph.D.Professor, Rutgers University "Recently, I started to use ThreeDify Excel Grapher , and am delighted with the outcome. As an add-on to Excel, ThreeDify Excel Grapher is very easy to use, and I really enjoy the software’s ability to allow visualization of my data in 3-D surface plot."   Jim Peterson, Ph.D.,Research Scientist, Research Automation Technologies, Amgen Inc. "Thanks for your help! I am amazed the changes that you made in your fine product. I appreciate the chance to be able to use this to my advantge for my engineering designs and technical presentations.
