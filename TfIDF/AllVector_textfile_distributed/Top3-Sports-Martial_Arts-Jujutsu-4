More information about the history of the Hontai Yoshin Ryu-Takagi Ryu lineage can be found in the archive section on our website: http://www.northlakesjujutsu.co.uk/archive.htm" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank'; The dojo is the headquarters of The North Lakes Jujutsu Association, an independent not for profit martial arts association based in Carlisle, and is the Motoha Yoshin Ryu headquarters for the UK under the supervision of the British Hombu-cho Andy McCormack. The North Lakes Jujutsu Association was founded in 1992 by Andy McCormack and training partner Martin Elliot, with the aims of furthering their study of traditional Japanese Jujutsu, and to promote authentic Japanese Jujutsu in Cumbria and the North. We were initially introduced to Yasumoto Soke as teenagers, when at that time (mid-1980s) as a Menkyo Kaiden teacher of Hontai Yoshin Ryu, Yasumoto sensei visited the UK teaching Hontai Yoshin Ryu Jujutsu to the World Jujitsu Federation. Since then the standard of jujutsu and the North Lakes Jujutsu Association has grown from strength to strength, and in 2008 the association opened the Nelson Street Dojo, that features a 132m2, matted training area, changing rooms showers, a full range of striking equipment (bags, pads, mok jong), members lockers, weight training equipment, and training weapons. Sessions run: Monday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm Tuesday - Younger juniors (5+) 6:30pm to 7:30pm, Adults and older juniors 7:30pm to 9:30pm Wednesday - Black belt training by appointment Thursday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm Friday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm It is really w... 1 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 27 Jan 21:01 Vote this post up Vote this post down effective advertising submitted on Saturday 23 Nov by Fluffy_the_happy_lobster to General Jitsu Discussions Our club has just moved from being a split town/uni club to town only. This should allow us to advertise and put ourselves out there when we were previously unable to do so. It's been a change we've been considering for some time, but before we were able to make the call ourselves we encountered room and availability problems, which led to a tragic freshers showing, which led to the uni very quickly pulling the plug. After all, they were a bit desperate for the space. So, that leaves us with the town session (we had two sessions a week). So this leads me to my query, what have you found to be the most effective advertising? I don't want anything excessive; our club has around 8-13 on a mat each session and I'd like to increase this to about 12-18 per session. Beyond the website (which I need to revise), what do you suggest? What have you found that works well in the past? What is your average mat? This is our first solid foray into being a town-only club so are there any pitfalls to avoid? Many clubs, ours included, offer 1st session free deals. Do you think they really motivate folk to come down? Personally, I'm now of the view that for a town club, it doesn't. Thoughts? 16 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 20 Nov 10:11 Vote this post up Vote this post down Kids 'games' for JuJitsu - ideas welcome :) submitted on Friday 15 Nov by nry to Children in Jiu Jitsu Beyond running around like nutters to tire them out, I like tucking a small length of belt in the belt of the kids and pretty much playing tag rubgy, last one with the section of belt left wins. Same as above but back-to-back is good, and last week I tried a Gracie game called Crazy Horse which the kids really loved - I will do this more now as it has many levels of difficulty Can anyone else suggest any games which have relevant JuJitsu learning within them, but are still seen as games by the kids? 3 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 11 Jan 19:01 Vote this post up Vote this post down Sayōnara submitted on Friday 08 Nov by rne02 to General Jitsu Discussions I think it is clear that the forum is (almost) dead, which is a shame as this was always one of the better and more sensible ones. In fact, most forums I see see to be on the wain, I think the medium seems to have had it's day. But the lack of activity prompts me to move on. I would like to thank everyone for their help whenever I have asked a question, and for sharing information. I wish you all luck in the future and hope your training continues as you would wish it to. So long, and thanks for all the fish. 7 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 22 Nov 12:11 Vote this post up Vote this post down Anywhere near Stamford/Peterborough/Leicester? submitted on Wednesday 06 Nov by TiggerDeluxe to Yellow Pages Hey all , new here would love to train/learn JJ/BJJ in this area; Stamford/Deeping/Bourne, or can travel to Leicester area.

We're pretty sorted for that, but we also have the potential for a demonstration slot, and yet again we're prepared(ish), we need to see the demo area to make sure it's a viable proposition, but other than the normal risk assessment I think that we're good to go. We've been through this a few times before so there shouldn't be any issues. However I just thought it would be worth canvasing opinions on what could be good / different / eye-catching based on what the collective wisdom of this forum can offer from their own experiences. So fire away - any thoughts?………... 3 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) Birthdays No birthdays today Birthdays within the next 7 days: Enuptustofs (29), Thetexceegoke (27), sfBGyd (27), jonaserag (31), annaburton (39), tsmichala (31), UHThomas (25), jadessy (27), mdxyuoyb (29), Emaryabntf (30), Emaryanjia (30), Emaryasqky (30), Emaryaxnfc (30), Emaryaziee (30), Emarybqgrf (30), Emarybvort (30), Emarybwoim (30), Emarycabcy (30), Emarycdete (30), Emarycfaxg (30), Emarycflld (30), Emarychadi (30), Emaryclyyo (30), Emarycpafw (30), Emarycscec (30), Emarycstbv (30), Emaryctyjl (30), Emarycwlxw (30), Emarydatgm (30), Emarydfgve (30), Emarydfptv (30), Emarydgeuy (30), Emarydkusw (30), Emarydkwjt (30), Emarydlqfz (30), Emarydyhwz (30), Emaryecsnv (30), Emaryeesjr (30), Emaryezblg (30), Emaryfbluq (30), Emaryffgxq (30), Emaryfiibs (30), Emarygbtfw (30), Emarygjkqi (30), Emarygpcsl (30), Emarygrhan (30), Emarygvwed (30), Emaryhaqzr (30), Emaryhbccl (30), Emaryhcbri (30), Emaryhhmur (30), Emaryhkzzh (30), Emaryhtfgh (30), Emaryhvelw (30), Emaryibmnb (30), Emaryifzdz (30), Emaryiienk (30), Emaryijsbd (30), Emaryinejs (30), Emaryitizc (30), Emaryjaaly (30), Emaryjbhdi (30), Emaryjfuaa (30), Emaryjgnvr (30), Emaryjhuyl (30), Emaryjktfe (30), Emaryjqfha (30), Emaryjrnrj (30), Emaryjsalg (30), Emarykhhha (30), Emarykjbgo (30), Emarykmflm (30), Emarykqomf (30), Emarykvlzs (30), Emarylfrdc (30), Emaryltatu (30), Emarymngdz (30), Emarymopfi (30), Emarympnak (30), Emarynacuj (30), Emarynboro (30), Emaryngclv (30), Emarynllwi (30), Emarynwxpa (30), Emaryobcyw (30), Emaryoedsr (30), Emaryogwjh (30), Emaryokvfk (30), Emaryooaig (30), Emaryorbdc (30), Emaryovvnc (30), Emaryovvou (30), Emarypfwtg (30), Emarypnbkg (30), Emarypwjrr (30), Emaryqbyfw (30), Emaryqefpm (30), Emaryqgevl (30), Emaryqiilt (30), Emaryqrirl (30), Emaryqukao (30), Emaryqvidt (30), Emaryrjaol (30), Emaryrlcyv (30), Emarysbowv (30), Emarysdric (30), Emaryseiox (30), Emarysoxmh (30), Emarysvsgv (30), Emarysvugi (30), Emaryszpti (30), Emarytltgg (30), Emarytoael (30), Emarytsvjn (30), Emaryttguf (30), Emarytxubc (30), Emarytysgz (30), Emaryudapx (30), Emaryuszzb (30), Emaryvbzxy (30), Emaryvexud (30), Emaryvfkhz (30), Emaryvfogk (30), Emaryvpkds (30), Emaryvsiqn (30), Emaryvuvwq (30), Emaryvwint (30), Emaryvxveq (30), Emaryvxwtf (30), Emarywforq (30), Emarywfume (30), Emarywhlnw (30), Emarywiaxh (30), Emarywkdpt (30), Emarywokbu (30), Emarywqmbv (30), Emarywtbnv (30), Emarywxsji (30), Emaryxagsv (30), Emaryxrldk (30), Emaryxzrgq (30), Emaryyeera (30), Emaryyprkp (30), Emaryzirbd (30), Emaryzkzeq (30), Emaryzoeke (30), Quiet Riot , prefenouppomb (37) Statistics Total posts 233012 Total topics 9788 Total members 3059 Our newest member Miguelcime Activity over the last 24 hours New Posts 6 New Topics 0 New users 11 Home Forums Journals Arcade Articles Search Signup Register Login Username Password Remember me Hide me Home Delete all board cookies All times are UTC [ DST ] About Planet Jitsu (PJ) is an open, friendly community for Jiu Jitsuka and other martial artists.
