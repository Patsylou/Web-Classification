Ensuring that legacies are preserved, economic imperatives are achieved and that human lives are enriched and safeguarded, despite the fallibility of its physical building blocks, is the domain of a wide range of anti-corrosion experts. A study conducted by the University of the Witwatersrand and quoted in "Corrosion Control in Southern Africa" edited by John McEwan, estimated the direct cost of corrosion to the South African economy at R154 billion per annum (2005).  As long as our world is largely built from materials with an innate tendency to corrode, a broad spectrum of stakeholders will always have an interest in controlling the impact of corrosion on asset lifecycles, productivity and human life.  The Corrosion Institute (CorrISA) exists to serve these stakeholders and to promote the success of their collaborative efforts.  Events Visitors are welcome at most of our functions.
