Welcome to The Virtual Center for Epidemiological Criminology (VCEC).  The site is still being developed so bear with us!  Basically what Epidemiological Criminology or "EpiCrim", is trying to achieve is integration between public health and criminal justice.  Most, if not all, of the problems facing society can be subsumed under these domains.  Explicit and reciprocal linkages between the two holds great promise for societal problem solving.  The VCEC seeks to provide funding and research opportunities for young faculty and students who are interested in helping solve societal problems.  Epidemiological Criminology has already garnered considerable academic and policy interest.  Please browse the website and make any suggestions for improvement.  Brandon Ferweda at UCF is responsible for maintaining the site.  VCEC©2006 Create a Free Website
