After all, we operate and maintain our own in-house NMR spectrometer. We realize that the last thing you want is to repeat a run because of shimming problems caused by a faulty NMR tube. Or worse, during use, your tube ends up breaking because of poor tube dimension. With our NMR tubes you are guaranteed superior quality and remarkable performance.
