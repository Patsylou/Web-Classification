 KEGS/SDL Apple IIGS emulator What is it? Here is my holiday hack on the great KEGS Apple IIGS emulator, which consists of implementing an SDL driver for video, sound, keyboard, and joystick. This should make the emulator portable to many more OSes (incl. BeOS, MacOS, Linux, Win32). The code is based on the original KEGS, with modifications from the KEGS32 port (current version includes modifications up to kegs32r2) Screenshots The only visible difference with the original KEGS is the KEGS control panel, which can be reached by typing control-openapple-tab, as seen on these screenshots: 1 , 2 , 3 . You can also notice that the status lines are now using the Apple II font (the basic SDL library has no font support). Using SDL, KEGS can now also run in fullscreen mode (either 640x480 or 640x400). TODO I would like to add the following: possibility to paste text to the emulator (on X11 and possibly Win32) disk swapping facility (probably OS-specific too, possibly drag'n'drop). support for keyboards other than QWERTY (like the infamous French keyboard). Download Cygwin compiler (I don't have VC++). kegs-sdl-0.64.tar.gz ( release notes ) kegs-0.63.tar.gz kegs-0.62-0.63.patch.gz kegs-0.61-0.62.patch.gz There is a patch for KEGS 0.63 that optimizes palette changes (which happen frequently in demos or games), but require a change in the SDL library. Please read carefully the instructions inside. If anyone manages to compile and run it on anything other than Linux, Unix or Cygwin, please contact me .
