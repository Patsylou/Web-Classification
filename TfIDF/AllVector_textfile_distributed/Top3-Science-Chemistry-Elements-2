From the Greek word for a beam or ray, aktis . Say what? Actinium is pronounced as ak-TIN-ee-em . History and Uses: Actinium was discovered in 1899 by Andr-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, while experimenting with new methods of separating rare earth oxides. Friedrich Otto Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902.  Actinium is a rare element that is present in uranium ores in tiny amounts, but it is usually cheaper and easier to create actinium when it is needed by bombarding radium with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Actinium's most stable isotope , actinium-227, has a half-life of 21.77 years. It decays into francium -223 through alpha decay or into thorium -227 through beta decay . Actinium has no significant commercial applications, although it is used in the production of neutrons.
