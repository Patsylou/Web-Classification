 ALL ABOUT ENTROPY, THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS, AND ORDER FROM DISORDER ENTROPYLAW.COM Foundations of Physics, Life and Cognition: Basic Texts, Reviews, Research Material The law of entropy , or the second law of thermodynamics , along with the first law of thermodynamics comprise the most fundamental laws of physics. Entropy (the subject of the second law) and energy (the subject of the first law) and their relationship are fundamental to an understanding not just of physics, but to life (biology, evolutionary theory, ecology) , cognition (psychology) . According to the old view, the second law was viewed as a 'law of disorder'. The major revolution in the last decade is the recognition of the law of maximum entropy production or and with it an expanded view of thermodynamics showing that the spontaneous production of order from disorder is the expected consequence of basic laws . This site provides basic texts, articles, links, and references that take the reader from the classical views of thermodynamics in simple terms, to today's new and richer understanding.
