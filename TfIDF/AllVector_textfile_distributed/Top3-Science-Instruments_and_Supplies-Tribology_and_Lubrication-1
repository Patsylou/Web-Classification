With the widest range of tribology testing instruments, including some of the most technologically advanced instruments in the industry, our products can help you study most situations where understanding wear, friction and lubrication behavior is important. NEW! TriboChemist® - A new method for in-situ tribochemical studies. In order to meet the very stringent emission requirements that will be introduced over the next few years, zinc-, phosphorus- and sulfur-containing additives, currently used in engine oil formulations, must be replaced by alternative, ecologically compatible additives.

Higher stability in oxide layers, for instance tantalum pentaoxide (Ta2o5) is known to improve the corrosion resistance of the Ta and finding its place in various biomedical []... Product Update | Universal High Temperature Tribometer The High Temperature Universal Tribometer can open new vistas in the study of interaction between materials. In addition to standard tribological tests such as pin-on-disk, fretting wear and scratch test, it can also function as a precision indentation device. Accurate measurements of friction, wear and loads are facilitated by sensors of multiple ranges and a robust design to ensure measurements remain unaffected by []...
