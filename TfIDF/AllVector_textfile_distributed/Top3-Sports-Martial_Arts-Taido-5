Taido in Australia Taido is a Japanese martial art that was brought to Australia in 1997 by Fredrik Utbult (6 Dan Kyoshi) and Louise Carlsson (4 Dan Renshi) who have been national team members, club instructors and national coaches in their home country of Sweden. The first club was established at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney and there are current plans to form new clubs in Sydney in the near future. Australia has sent national teams to the World Taido Championships (Sweden 2005 and Japan 2009) and the Sakura Tournaments held in Hirosaki, Japan (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012). Australian Taido also hosts the Asia Pacific Taido Friendship Games and competes in the National All Stars Martial Arts Tournaments. We are a friendly bunch of people known for our fun Taido spirit and always welcome new people to join! If you would like to try out Taido, pop by one of our trainings (check schedule here ).
