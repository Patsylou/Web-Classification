We study, through computer simulations, a model system of segments which can spontaneously assemble to form large polymeric aggregates. We show that strength of short range attraction and long range repulsion between segments leads to randomly networked gel states even in very dilute solutions. The short range attraction favors the growth of polymers and long range repulsion stabilizes the percolating network.
