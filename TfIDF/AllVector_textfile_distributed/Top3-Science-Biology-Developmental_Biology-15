Welcome. The Vanderbilt University Program in Developmental Biology offers a stimulating and supportive environment for researchers to study pattern formation, cellular differentiation and morphogenesis during the developmental process. Membership in the Developmental Biology Program is currently at 245 and includes researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, technicians and support personal across the School of Medicine and Arts Sciences campuses.  Program members utilize many different approaches in their attempt to answer developmental questions based on their particular field of study. This mixing pot of scientific disciplines has given our members the freedom to adopt an interspecies approach to their research. Some of the fundamental questions addressed by the researchers in our program are: How is the basic body plan of an embryo established? What are the factors that drive embryonic morphogenesis? How is a heart formed? How do neurons choose synaptic partners? As our members work to answer these questions they are encouraged them to participate in activities that are sponsored by the Program. These activities include: Didactic Courses Invited Guest Speaker Presentations and Meetings Weekly Developmental Biology Journal Club Seminars Monthly Developmental Biology Research Seminars Bi-monthly Student-Only Research in Construction Meetings Monthly Postdoctoral Fellows-Only Career Development Meetings BI-monthly Student and Postdoctoral Fellow Research Happy Hours Annual Scientific Retreat CONFERENCE ROOM AVAILABILITY The Program in Developmental Biology schedules the MRBIII Cell and Developmental Biology conference room for users outside of the department.
