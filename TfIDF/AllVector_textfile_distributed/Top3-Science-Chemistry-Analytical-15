 PenBase Penaeidin database Structural features Diversity Biological properties Penaeidin signature Penaeidin subgroups Definition Reassignment PenBase is a curated database devoted to Penaeidins Antimicrobial peptides are major components of innate immunity that have been conserved in evolution and found in different phyla of the plant and animal kingdom. Antimicrobial peptides are often small cationic molecules widely distributed in the whole living kingdom where they participate to host defence reactions against invading microorganisms. They are known to be involved in the innate immune response of vertebrate, invertebrate and plant species, and they are thought to be essential in organisms which lack adaptive immunity. Litopenaeus vannamei , which present both Gram-positive antibacterial and antifungal activities ( Destoumieux et al, 1997 ). Penaeidins appear to be a family of antimicrobial peptides ubiquitous among penaeid shrimps where they are major actors of the immune response ( Bachre et al ., 2004 ). Dev Comp Immunol .
