Anointed Martial Arts is a Christian martial arts facility offering a Christ centered alternative to traditional martial arts. The style taught at our facility is best described as a freestyle martial art. The physical techniques taught in class are derived from Kenpo, Taekwondo, American Boxing, Muay Thai, Jiu Jitsu, Kali and various other styles. However, our primary goal is to develop Disciples of Christ who are willing to speak the truth in love and stand up for those that can not stand for themselves. The blending of styles, along with the desire to teach God’s word, is what makes this program one of the most well rounded self defense programs available. We offer classes for 4 year olds through adults, including family classes. Each class has age appropriate instruction that includes the teaching of Godly principles and sound Biblical doctrine. We also offer MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) Classes for those that are looking for a less traditional approach to martial arts. These classes are designed for participants 17 and older that want to get all of the benefits of Mixed Martial Arts training without actually stepping inside a cage. This program is a great way to gain strength, endurance and muscle tone while working out in a Christian atmosphere.
