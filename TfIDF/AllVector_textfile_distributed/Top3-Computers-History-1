Chronology of Personal Computers (Ken Polsson) Computing Science, History of Computers: From the Past to the Present History of Computing Information this Web author would have you believe that computers are here because of the military but the USA wasn't even a thought yet when Babbage and Lovelace were working on and programming machines before the Industrial Revolution, before the production of steel, so the "because of the Army or because of the military is all wet... Eisenhower was President when Russian launched Sputnik and that was a scientific embarassment. In late 1957 (October) Sputnik was launched. It didn't take long for the President to ask for and for Congress to vote to create ARPA. (See ARPA links) Later, a branch off of ARPA became NASA and they used computers but projects were space oriented.. ARPANET was the non-military branch that created the Internet nodes, first being at the non-military UCLA. The ARMY could have computers because of pre-exisiting technologies that had no prior connection with the military. Stop giving the military the credit for having computers... The military had a need and had computers built to fill a need, but none of the technologies up until then had to do with the military's think tank... The inventors were independent of the US military, or had been civililians when asked to help the military to build the computers.

ABOUT.COM'S SURVEY of computer history site, briefly does a fair job of touching the bare surface of the late historical period of the 20th century with some entries in the 21st century but nothing here about 1600's-1899. Not much depth here, but there is a lot of name dropping. If you need a name, they got 'em. Would be nice to see more Bibliographies, more detail and more depth. Might be suitable for grade school students. Not enough depth for research. This is not a significant computer history site, with omissions of important early works, but is owned by a corporation that can afford to do better. Timeline only from 1939 - 1994 also omits earlier developments. This is a good site for information from that narrow time range and it includes personal information about some of the people involved in computer technology in only the 20th century, so far. Altair, Commodore-64 machines are covered, and other earlier computers such as the machines produced by Konrad Zuse, and his Z4. Site has a push for monetary donations. Commercial site. Pictures Site has many pictures, not all from the public domain, but the pictures are not sourced and I )regret that a site supposedly for students has no source information from where they took/acquired the photographic images. I would like to know if they have permission to use the approx. (stated 50 pictures.?? (Students: you are not to use copyrighted information nor photographs on a Web site without stating the source AND having written permission or you are violating copyright.) This site deserves removal from the list until sourcing or a note about copyright has been included... permissions are necessary, and must be visibly sourced,referencing the copyright holder, by law. Computer Hardware Good coverage of computer hardware and calculating history, early Russian, Australian, German and British machines included in the discussion, along with American machines. Excellent References and Footnotes... This site deserves #1 on Googles list. Wake up, Google team.. take a look. this site has hours of work. Hitmill.com's History of Computers has been a leader in the History of Computers parade of sites since 1998, raising the bar and challenging others to get better. A 65-year old grandmother hand-coded this page (and this entire domain, which began in 1998) in NotePad, to show students that Web pages can be made without buying software. The site is in the process of adding a timeline and should not be relegated down at the fifth level for it is a quality page with depth, sourcing, footnoting, and Bibliographies in its multiple page structure. Obviously well planned with the research students in mind. This site has grown up, since 1998, and remains a top "History of Computers and Computing Timeline" Web site. A historical site made with raw HTML and no software. Non-commercial, non-corporate site, not asking for money, with a couple of click-ads from Google quietly generating pennies for Grandma's hosting.
