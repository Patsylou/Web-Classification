 The Contemporary Artists Center, Woodside is a multi-purpose art organization originally founded in Massachusetts, and now operating in Troy, NY. For the last 20 years the CAC has presented and procured artists who want to produce, explore, test new concepts and expand the current debates and ideas in todayâ€™s art and culture. Through its artists' residencies, art studios, workshops, lectures, innovative exhibitions and performances the CAC has fostered the creation and appreciation of insightful and engaging contemporary art.
