Today we are one of the UK's leading institutions for political studies, with particular strengths in: comparative and international politics political theory politics and media; and European politics. Our teaching is research-led but student centred, which means that if you study with us you can expect small class sizes, the chance to develop and defend arguments in a rigorous and analytical manner, and opportunities to engage in constructive debate.
