These open solutions enable companies to transform their process of innovation and maximize the value derived from their products throughout their entire lifecycle. PLM, or product lifecycle management , can be defined as an information strategy: it builds a coherent data structure by consolidating systems. You can also call PLM an enterprise strategy: it lets global organizations work as a single team to design, produce, support and retire products, while capturing best practices and lessons learned along the way. We view PLM as an information strategy, an enterprise strategy and, ultimately, a transformational business strategy. With an enterprise PLM strategy you can establish a digital environment to create, develop, manufacture and manage innovation on a comprehensive basis. Our product suites offer capabilities that span the product lifecycle, from design inception to manufacture and support. By doing so, they help turn more of our customers’ ideas into successful products.
