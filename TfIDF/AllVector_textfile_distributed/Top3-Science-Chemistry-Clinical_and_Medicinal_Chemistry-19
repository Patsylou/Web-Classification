University of the Sciences' uncommon four-year BS curriculum in pharmaceutical chemistry will prepare you for careers in this rapidly-growing field by introducing you to all aspects of drug development, from initial design of a new drug to delivery of the drug to the patient. Meeting the Demand Pharmaceutical chemistry focuses on the discovery of new drugs and the development of tools needed to monitor their large-scale synthesis and medical effectiveness. With a more sophisticated patient population and a large number of an aging population seeking to remain active, demand for chemists with a specialization in the areas of chemistry that are closely related to pharmaceuticals is high. As a graduate you will be able to pursue rewarding positions in large and small pharmaceutical companies and with government agencies.
