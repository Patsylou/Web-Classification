TIP Manila has two campuses, TIP Arlegui and TIP P. Casal, while TIP Quezon City is housed in one campus. Both schools are headed by one President, Dr. Elizabeth Quirino-Lahoz, an academics and management committee and an executive management committee, but maintain two separate academic identities. In December 2009, the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED) awarded TIP Quezon City the Autonomous Status, the highest possible award for a higher education institution, in recognition of TIPQCs exemplary performance shown in the provision of quality higher education, research and extension work. In the same year, TIP Manila was also granted by CHED a Deregulated Status after it has satisfied the qualifications set by the commission.
