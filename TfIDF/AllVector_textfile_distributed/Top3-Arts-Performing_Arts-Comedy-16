Improvazilla Mainstage Show ITM Improv Workshop ITM Improv Jamalama ITM Student Showcase ITM Improv Foundation Class Standup Workshops New Material Night The Hobgoblin Show All our shows are in English ! The Tokyo Comedy Store loves all kinds of comedy, but standup and improv are the nearest to our heart. Our shows tend to focus on one or the other, but some have a little of both, and you can use our handy chart here to get a sense of what our shows offer. You can also see we have workshops and events that foster the comedy enthusiasts who learn and participate in our broader Tokyo Comedy Store community. We have a system for developing talent up from student shows and open mike nights to our featured shows, loosely represented by Mount Fuji in the background. See this map on the Google Maps web site The Tokyo Comedy Store performs around Tokyo, though as you can see we perform mainly around Shibuya, and over the years we've had shows in Roppongi and Shinjuku. We go where the heat is, and that means essentially the main hangouts for the English speaking community.
