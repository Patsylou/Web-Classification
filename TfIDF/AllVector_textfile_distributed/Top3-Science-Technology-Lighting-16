LEDs, Guys in the Snow, in the Dark, Not Porn. February 20, 2014 / Jim / artists , LEDs , Light Art , Video 0 Ok, I want to do this.  Wait, its 70 outside and the ocean breeze is outstanding.  Suck on THAT , Midwest! I kid! Watch: WOO Productions made this.   WOO Productions has some pretty awesome projects under their belt , you should go over there and check out their catalogue of work.  BUT NOT RIGHT THIS SECOND, WAIT DAMMIT ! From the video: Two Mountainbikers, fully equipped with a lot of LEDs, enlighten the trails as they ride in the dark. There are so many action sports videos on the internet nowadays that its hard to mix things up. Pretty much everything has already been done by someone else. This concept has left us wanting to create something innovative for quite a while now. We just didnt have the big idea until we talked to Phillippe. After a day of testing with the aerial drone in 2012 the actual plan was to produce a Enduro or Trailbiking video with WOOProductions this year. It all turned out a little differently, though. The filming for the Enduro video never happened, but we ended up getting this idea for a completely different project. Phillippe, the founder of WOOProductions, came up with the idea of using LED lights for a video- a lot of them. At a meeting he explained his concept or at least he tried to, as it was quite a complex idea. It was hard for us to imagine the outcome but we almost had to give it a try due to how intrigued he was with the idea. The goal was never to document a day in the life kind of thing or produce a video with logical content. We would definitely not go for a normal ride at night with hundreds of little lights spread all over our bikes and bodies while still not seeing anything. We just wanted to create something different that looked cool for your and our entertainment- simple as that. How I should have started this article was something like Do you want to see some outstanding light art in the snow with LEDs glowing on bicycles?
