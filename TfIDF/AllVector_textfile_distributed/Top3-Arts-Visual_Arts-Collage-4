Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining materials. Materials may be worked by removal such as carving; or they may be assembled such as by gluing, or hardened such as by firing. Our sculpture lessons include forming, carving, collaging, gluing and more and make use of materials such as clay, wood, soap, paper, tape, beans, foam, metal, stones and more.
