 El Epicentro A short story by the maskmonger Archives Mask of the Month Index of Masks Tusked Negrito - Oaxaca Pastorela Devil Mask - Zacatecas Man's mask from Guerrero Dance of the Viejitos, Michoacan Paragueros Dance - Woman Carnival Mask, Guanajuato Man's Mask (Mex. origin unknown) Demon Mask, Naolinco, Veracruz Clown Mask, Veracruz Mexican Buzzard Hat MASK TOUR ----- Dance of the Christians Moors - Guatemala Fine old masks such as this are highly valued by collectors and museums. Carved in semi-hardwood with glass eyes (one broken), it has miscellaneous repairs and most of its original finish is intact. The mask has been well used and its back (link below) has a rich, dark patina more common to old Guatemalan masks than Mexican ones. The fit is extremely comfortable for a variety of facial shapes. To a collector, the back of a mask is sometimes more important than the front. An authentic, old patina on the back is a testimony to the mask's use in its rightful context. The piece at the left is authentic but with many masks commonly encountered in the marketplace and through dealers, clever techniques have been used by artisan-carvers to create a false patina intended to make the mask seem older or more valuable than it really is. False wear marks, deliberate abuse and subsequent repairs are also used in this crafty craft. Age: Approx. 100 years. See also: .

In spite of a happy ending, the tiring fandango has no real utility other than to mock a bevy of little old men, all dancing - or better to say hobbling - with feeble knees and canes while simultaneously making lecherous fools of themselves. I'm not a whistleblower but I can't understand why the elderly and the handicapped - true victims of this cruel pageant - have not uttered a single word of protest up to now; perhaps they're just too intimidated by the dance's widespread popularity to complain; thus the Baile de los Viejitos continues in its long-standing tradition as a cute and endearing icon of Mexican culture.
