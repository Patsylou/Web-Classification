 skip to main skip to sidebar 12.05.2013 This holiday season ecoartspace is seeking to raise approximately $4,000 to support initial research for development of two ACTION GUIDES including Tree Museum and Tattfoo Tan's SOS projects . The donated art works are curated from our 2010 What Matters Most Benefit in NYC, which were created in response to Andrew Revkin's NY Times Dot Earth Blog post inviting scientists to answer this simple yet very important question. Artists include: Jill Vasileff, Mary Mattingly, Suzan Shutan, Molly Herman, Amy Bassin, Sandi Slone, Nicole Fournier, Julia Kunin, David Schafer, Cathey Billian, Greg Patch, Joan Perlman, Aleta Wolfe, Elisa Pritzker, Lorrie Fredette, Richard Samuelson, Joseph Smolinski, Claudia Hart, Karen Dolmanisth, Bill Schuck, Sarah Havilland, Marion Wilson, Stacy Levy, Abigail Stern. We've had great feedback from our first HighWaterLine ACTION Guide and look forward to developing more of these successful socially engaged DIY public art projects in 2014, providing communities with unique tools to respond creatively to climate change and environmental degradation.
