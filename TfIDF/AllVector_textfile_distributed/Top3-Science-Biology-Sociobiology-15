Andrew Brown introduces the warring factions with a common devotion to Darwin Share Tweet this Email theguardian.com Thursday 4 March 1999 These two parties need names, and I propose to call them Gouldians and Dawkinsians. This won't please anyone involved. They will point out that the parties in question are vague and disorganised; that they don't have leaders and that if they did the candidates would be the men who got most respect as scientists in each party: Maynard Smith, perhaps, and Lewontin, not Dawkins and Gould. © Andrew Brown, 1999 The dispute The easiest way to illustrate this dispute is by an analogy which Dawkins originally used in another context. Genomes are like recipes. Bodies are like cakes. The original, and important, point of this analogy was to argue against the idea that there were simple correspondences between genes and bodies. If genes were like blueprints for buildings, as opposed to recipes, you could add something to the blueprint and know what effect it would have on the building. Conversely, you can look at a building and reconstruct its blueprint.  To order a copy for £9.99 (plus 99p UK pp), freephone 0500 600 102, or send a UK cheque (payable to "The Guardian CultureShop") to 250 Western Avenue, London, W3 6EE, or e-mail Sign up for the Guardian Today Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.
