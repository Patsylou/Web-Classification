The promotions were grand to get eyeballs and easy impressionable minds ... Read more War Torn But Still Dangerous Read more Be Wary of the Premature Writeoff "To paraphrase Mark Twain, the rumors of Sergio's demise have been greatly exaggerated.

Read more Pacman Is Ripe For The Taking Regarding Pacquiao's chin...A heart may be repairable but a chin has a fixed resistance, heightened only by adrenalin.
