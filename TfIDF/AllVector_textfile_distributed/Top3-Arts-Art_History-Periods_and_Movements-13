Colorfield painting is a type of abstract art that consists of broad areas of unmodulated or low-contrast color on a very shallow picture plane. -- Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko , 1943 in a letter to The New York Times When and where did Colorfield painting develop? Clement Greenberg . Morris Louis Stained-Canvas Painting (above right) Helen Frankenthaler (b.1928-), an important painter whose abstraction includes landscape-like images, moved Colorfield painting ahead when she introduced the idea of staining color into unprimed canvas. This innovation in painting provided an ideal of the truly flattened picture plane. -- Barnett Newman "The Sublime is Now", 1948 Who are the significant Colorfield painters? Barnett Newman (1905-1970) and painters Clyfford Still (1904-1980) and Mark Rothko (1903-1970) were innovators in Colorfield painting . Morris Louis (1912-1962) and Kenneth Noland (b.1924), key players in the Washington Colorfield Group, took Frankenthaler's stained canvas idea and built their art upon it. In the late 1960's, using spray guns Jules Olitski (b.1922) made paintings entirely from mists of color. Barnett Newman Painting (left) How does Colorfield Painting relate to Post-Painterly Abstraction? Pompous tone aside, "post-painterly abstraction" incorrectly implies a sequential development in abstract art from gestural into non-gestural painting. In reality, the late 1940's and 1950's saw a fertile, churning sea of abstract art ideas and painting experiments from which various forms emerged and evolved throughout the second half of the 20th century. See the influence of Colorfield painting in the work of 21st century abstract painters such as Todd Bellanca , Jim Napierala and Nancy Van Deren .
