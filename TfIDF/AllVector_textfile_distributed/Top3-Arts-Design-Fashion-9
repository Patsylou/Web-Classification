Phillip Lim , Purse du Jour Comments (12) Keeping it in the Famiglia Its been FAR too long since we last featured a Tokidoki bag terrible of us, we know! After browsing a selection of Tokidoki goodies in a Hollywood store yesterday, weve decided to remind everyone about this wonderful collection. This particular bag is the Nuvola Famiglia, a delightfully funky bag with an adjustable shoulder stap (which happens to have a pocket on it) and zipper closures. The best thing about Tokidoki products are always the amazingly cute and morbid design, and this bag is no exception the Famiglia style is ridiculously charming. We guarantee people will stop you and ask where you got your Tokidoki! Team this one up with some Lucky jeans and flats! SRP $184.00 April 25, 2008. LeSportsac , Purse du Jour Comments (11) Dolce Bunny We all know that white purses can be the devil no matter how well you take care of them, there will always be that special someone who steps on it with a muddy shoe or manages to get paint on it. When that special someone happens to be the same person who shares your bed, disaster in the form of screaming and crying usually ensues, with the unlucky other half usually sealing their fate with comments like s only a (bleep)ing purse! Despite these little catastrophes, white purses will always be irresistible like the Miss Bunny Satchel from Dolce and Gabbana. Made of an absolutely gorgeous white grained leather with silver hardware, this lovely luxurious bag has an animal print lining and a removable rolled leather shoulder strap. As for the perfect outfit to carry this bag with why dont you guys make some suggestions? Dont be shy! SRP $2,650.00 April 24, 2008. Dolce and Gabbana , Purse du Jour Comments (3) Tods Softy Messenger Theres nothing like a beautiful blue purse and this particular one from Tods is just so very lovely. Going by the oh-so apt name of the Softy Messenger Media, this bag is made of a soft smooth grained leather with polished silver hardware and very cute little ruched sides. The braided leather strap is just the crowning touch on what is a delightfully blue bag from Tods. Try teaming this purse up with Diesel jeans and a Juicy Couture top! SRP $1,800.00 April 14, 2008. Purse du Jour , Tod's Comments (7) Fendis Amazing Multicolored Dream Bag How delightful is this purse from Fendi? Called the Multicolored Doctor B Bag, this gorgeous grained-leather purse is deliciously retro with its pastel rainbow theme and magnetic frame-top closure. Very much a daytime purse, match this one up with some nice jeans and a lovely summery top (check out Chloes current line for some gorgeous summer dresses!). Perfect for the sunny season! SRP $1,840.00 April 14, 2008. Chloe , Purse du Jour Comments (6) Versace Croc This striking purse is the Croc-Stamped Boston Bag from Versace, a wonderfully kooky addition to the season. Made of gorgeously croc-cy leather, this bag has silver hardware, a soft satin lining and patent leather trim. The key (hanging from the purse) and a Medusa mirror on the front complete this very noticeable and covetous bag. Well definitely be seeing this one for more than a while! SRP $1,655.00 April 11, 2008. Purse du Jour , Versace Comments (4) Posh Jacobs As lovely as this little purse is, we will be the first to admit that the main reason we are featuring it today is because it has the word in its name. The full name is the Posh Turnlock Convertible Tote, from Marc by Marc Jacobs. Its a tote/clutch hybrid, made of soft, crinkly Italian leather with a twist-lock closure and gold hardware. A great purse for everyday wear and tear! April 2, 2008. Marc Jacobs , Purse du Jour Comments (10) Juicy Fruits! Theres nothing like a purse that screams summer at you, and this delicious little bag is one of the summeriest bags weve seen so far this year. Its the Strawberry Fields Terry City Girl Bag, a wonderfully bright, sunshiny purse from Juicy Couture. Made of the standard Juicy terry cloth, this bag comes with a thick leather shoulder strap and gold hardware, as well as leather trim and removable accessories. A lovely purse for a lovely season! SRP $145.00 March 31, 2008. Juicy Couture , Purse du Jour Comments (18) Leopards for L.A.M.B This rather unusual-looking purse is the Leopard Chateau Clutch from L.A.M.B, Gwen Stefanis oh-so-hip fashion label. The reason this purse is being featured is that every once in a while, ArmCandyGirl likes to shake things up a little by featuring a bag that not everyone is likely to, shall we say appreciate. So whats nice about this clutch, then? Just for starters, it has a secure magnetic buckle and then theres the removable chain and of course we cant forget the gold hardware and lovely leather trim. The leopard design itself is very fresh and unusual all in all this is a very unique and daring way to greet the Spring. Nice one, Gwen! SRP $345.00 March 27, 2008. L.A.M.B , Purse du Jour Comments (3) Celine Day On This beautiful bag is the Buffalo Day On Tote from Celine, a lovely purse to take you through spring into summer time. Made of a lovely soft leather, the Buffalo Day On is one of the sturdiest bags you can carry this season not only does it have a fold-over top but it also has weighted corners for a more secure feel. Silver hardware and a decorative ring on the front top off this very feminine, luxurious purse! SRP $1,350.00 March 25, 2008.
