This three-hour workshop, open to all genders, will cover awareness for violence prevention, using voice and body language to diffuse a potentially dangerous situation, and physical skills to fight back and escape when necessary. The workshop will focus on application of these skills in social work and social services settings, not only to keep social workers feeling safer and stronger but also exploring how to communicate with clients about their own rights to personal safety and healing from trauma. The workshop will be taught by Sun Dragon black belt instructors who also have social work experience. Register here for $10.

Housing Testimonial One of our self defense students recently had the unfortunate opportunity to put some of her training into use during a violent incident. Heres what she had to say about what she learned from Sun Dragon: I took the training at Sun Dragon probably 15+ years ago. It left an impression on me that should I end up in a violent situation I would be able to defend myself. Unfortunately, as a social worker, I did end up being attacked by a client. The principles I fell back on were the ones that I learned in this training. First trying to give a verbal command get off of me as the assault began. As the assault progressed I was able to not freeze (which is critical) but to defend myself until I could get help through a panic button in my office. Im quite certain that through learning self defense I was able to save my life and the life of my unborn child (as I was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of the assault). I want everyone I know to have this knowledge and training so that should they end up in a similar situation they also have the tools to respond. We are immensely gratified that we were able to impart knowledge to this woman that enabled her to safely protect herself and her unborn child until she was able to get help. This is exactly what self defense training is all about, and as has been illustrated by this story, these skills are useful for life.
