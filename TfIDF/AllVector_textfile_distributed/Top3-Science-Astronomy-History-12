 General Information A Brief SETI Chronology Compiled by Robert M. Owen (email rowenInfoAve.Net ) 1959: Drs. Philip Morrison and Guiseppe Coconni publish in Nature 1960: The first SETI search, Project Ozma 1961: 1961: The first SETI Conference, Order of the Dolphin Drake Equation 1962: Following studies of Barnard's Star spanning his entire professional career, Dr. Peter van de Kamp concludes that the proper motion of this star can best be explained by the presence of one or more planets. Today, the question of planets surrounding Barnard's Star remains unresolved. 1966: 1971: A NASA study team, Project Cyclops 1971: 1972: 1972 - 1973: The Pioneer Plaques, containing a message about our Earth, destined for points beyond our solar system, are launched on the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 space probes. 1973: Ohio State University begins a major SETI project at its Big Ear Observatory in Delaware, Ohio [see l997]. 1974: 1977: 1977: Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes launched. They carry gold-plated records containing images and sounds of Earth. 1978: Cosmic Search 1979: 1979: 1981: The Proxmire Amendment kills Congressional support of NASA SETI 1981: 1981: The Planetary Society begins strong advocacy for NASA to conduct searches for extraterrestrial signals. Dr. Sagan, then president of the Society, persuades Senator Proxmire to stop opposition. 1982: 1982: 1983: 1983: 1983: 1983: 1983: 1984: 1985: 1985: 1986: UC-Berkeley's SERENDIP II begins to scan the skies. 1988: 1988: 1989: 1990: 1990: 1992: UC Berkeley launches SERENDIP III. 1992: NASA's HRMS observations are launched at Goldstone Observatory outside Barstow, California and at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. 1993: 1993: Funding for NASA's HRMS searches is eliminated by the US Congress. 1994: 1994: SETIQuest magazine founded by Mr. Carl Helmers, publisher, and Mr. Larry Klaes, editor. Helmers was inspired to start SETIQuest in part by the OSETI work of Dr. Kingsley, whom Klaes had introduced to Helmers. Publication terminated in 1998, after sixteen issues. 1995: The SETI league first accepts charter memberships (it has since grown to 1100 members in 56 countries). 1995: The SETI Institute launches Project Phoenix , a privatized continuation of the NASA HRMS targeted search, using the 210-foot Parkes radio telescope in New South Wales, Australia, the largest radio telescope in the southern hemisphere. Observations continue for six months. 1995: The Billion-Channel Extraterrestrial Assay (Project BETA) begins SETI observation from the Harvard radio telescope in Massachusetts. 1995: 51 Pegasi B, first confirmed planet around a nearby Sun-like star, announced by Drs. Michel Mayor and Dedier Queloz. By 1999, roster of confirmed exoplanets grows to over twenty. 1996: 1996: The SETI League launches Project Argus 1996: 1996: The Planetary Society funds Project SERENDIP IV at UC Berkeley. 1996: 1996: The SETI Institute's Project Phoenix resumes its targeted search from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank WV. 1996: "Invitation to ETI" SETI project is launched on the World Wide Web. (The invitation is now issued by 60 SETI and Contact scientists.) 1997: 1997: 1997: 1998: 1998: The SETI Institute's Project Phoenix continues its targeted search from the Arecibo Radio Observatory in Puerto Rico. 1998: 1998: 1999: Credits: email the Webmaster | Home | General | Memb Svcs | Publications | Press | Technical | Internet | Index | entire website copyright The SETI League, Inc.
