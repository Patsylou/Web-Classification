 chem1 virtual textbook a reference text Stephen Lower Simon Fraser University The eight pages in this section of the Chem1 Virtual Textbook cover elementary electrochemistry in somewhat greater depth than is found in standard textbooks, but at a level still suitable for first-year college and advanced high school courses. It should also be helpful as review material for students in more advanced courses in analytical and physical chemistry. This material is also available as a pdf document suitable for viewing or printing; click here to download (40 pages). To access the desired page, click one of the six lesson titles immediately below; you can also go directly to any sub-section within a lesson by clicking on a smaller heading.
