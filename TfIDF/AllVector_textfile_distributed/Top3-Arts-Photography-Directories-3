Welcome to Photography Homepages. Photography Homepages aims to catalogue only the very best in photography related web content. The directory was born out of a frustration with larger search engines and photography link sites which are automated and include just about any website, with little thought to quality, meaning you have to search through thousands of low quality sites to find the best photography on the web. We believe that there is no substitute for human editors passionate about photography, to search out the best in each category, whether it be Commercial photography, Architectural photography, Wedding or Portrait photography, Manufacturers, Nude or Fine Art photography, each site is considered by a human being passionate about photography and dedicated to making a high quality directory.We hope you enjoy using Photography Homepages. Remember to bookmark us and visit again. Featured Photographer : Nick Cobbing Every once in a while, something catches our editors eyes and stands out for special mention. We trawl through literally hundreds of photography links every day, and here we aim to give a little extra exposure to ones we have particularly liked. We are always on the lookout and aim to update this section fairly regularly. We hope you enjoy the images as much as we have. http://nickcobbing.co.uk 'Nick Cobbing is a photojournalist and photographic artist, currently living in the UK. His work focuses primarily on landscape and humankind's changing relationship with the natural world. Frequent visits to the Arctic have produced a powerful body of work about the wilderness of Greenland and the complexity of ice systems. Clocking up many hours of sea time, the oceans and seas have also exerted a powerful influence over his work.' Photography Homepages News.
