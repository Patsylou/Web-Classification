 Just Reworking the Site... Well, the last time I overhauled the hav.com website was back in 1998 - I had to verify that, in a fun way, using the Internet WayBack Machine . Soooo... some things may go away , temporarily or maybe forever. But, if you miss something in particular, let me know fun pages Anyway - enjoy the new site and watch out for falling rocks...
