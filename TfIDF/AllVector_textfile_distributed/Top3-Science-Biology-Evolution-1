Sarcodes sanguinea Debate tonight Matt Young on February 21, 2014 12:21 PM | 40 Comments (new) Sorry about the late notice, but we just heard about this from a commenter known as “eric”. Tonight, at 7:00 Central Standard Time (or 8:00 Eastern Standard Time), Sean Carroll will debate William Lane Craig on the subject, God and Cosmology . Professor Carroll is a physicist and cosmologist working on dark energy and dark matter at Caltech; Professor Craig is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and a well known Christian apologist. You may see their biographies at the link above. The debate is part of a forum sponsored by the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. It will be streamed live here . Professor Carroll has announced the debate here . I may report on the debate after it is over, but I will leave comments open here in any case. The amnesty on certain trolls will not be extended, however. Debate tonight Half of Americans will not admit to evolution Matt Young on February 17, 2014 3:04 PM | 166 Comments (new) An AFP press release the other day noted that 1 in 4 Americans does not know that the earth revolves around the sun, according to a poll of 2200 people conducted by the National Science Foundation. Additionally, approximately half do not know “that human beings evolved from earlier species of animals” or, perhaps more precisely, will not admit it. The average score on the 9-question quiz was 6.5. Americans nevertheless remain “enthusiastic” about science. The survey is part of a report that NSF will submit to the President. I could not immediately find any further information.

Wilson Sayres on February 16, 2014 9:52 PM | 28 Comments (new) A fun video introducing the variety of sex determination systems: http://youtu.be/kMWxuF9YW38 I like this as an introduction, which sets some good rules of thumb, but there are some excellent exceptions to these rules that we can get into. For example, in mammals (even humans), the part of the Y chromosome that is most responsible for turning on the male-determining pathway doesn’t always function as it should, resulting in individuals with an X and a Y chromosome who have female physical characteristics (for more see Ed Yong’s article about Chen et al.’s 2013 paper ). How is sex determined? Science secrets: book review Matt Young on February 13, 2014 3:40 PM | 12 Comments (new) The subtitle of this book by historian Alberto Martinez is, “The truth about Darwin’s finches, Einstein’s wife, and other myths,” and if you read it you will learn that Science secrets: book review Sterna antillarum browni Matt Young on February 10, 2014 12:00 PM | 13 Comments (new) Photograph by Marschal Fazio. Photography contest, Honorable Mention. Sterna antillarum browni – California least tern. Mr. Fazio writes, “This species is listed as endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act. It nests along the California coast on sandy shorelines; as humans have encroached, the tern has lost much of its nesting habitat and now nests in overcrowded sites or mudflats, making them more prone to predation.” Sterna antillarum browni Crystal Anniversary for the Wedge Document Matt Young on February 6, 2014 2:32 PM | 72 Comments (new) By Josh Rosenau . Reposted from NCSE’s Science League of America blog . A Crystal discoball to celebrate the crystal anniversary of the Disco. ‘tute’s entry into the creationism business. Fifteen years ago yesterday, a mail clerk in Seattle was handed a document to copy. As the Seattle Weekly reported, the packet was labeled “TOP SECRET” and “NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION,” and the cover sported an Illuminati-esque triangular design and a copy of Michelangelo’s “Creation of Adam.” The title: “The Wedge”; the author: a newly-created division of the conservative Discovery Institute, the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC). Later, the Center would drop “renewal” from its title to escape the religious reference, and also switched its logo from the Creation of Adam to a picture of God creating DNA, then to a more secular galactic nebula, and now a mashup of Leonardo’s Vitruvian man and a DNA strand. The Wedge Document, as the packet came to be known, laid out a bold plan by which the Center would “re-open the case for a broadly theistic understanding of nature,” and “reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.” From its first sentence, the document proclaimed its sectarian goals, stating: “The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West’s greatest achievements, including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress in the arts and sciences.” Crystal Anniversary for the Wedge Document Nye-Ham debate an hour away Matt Young on February 4, 2014 4:00 PM | 337 Comments (new) And you may watch it here on NBC or here on WCPO, Cincinnati. Piers Morgan will interview the debaters on CNN at 9:45 EST, and MSNBC will interview Bill Nye during the 10:00 hour, EST. C-Span will rebroadcast the event Wednesday, February 19 at 8 p.m. EST, according to WCPO. If you cannot wait till the end of the debate, you may leave comments below at any time. I suggest that we allow comments from (many of) our creationist trolls, as long as they are coherent. I will not allow comments that are merely insulting. Nye-Ham debate an hour away Ten Commandments for debates with creationists Nick Matzke on February 4, 2014 12:35 PM | 34 Comments (new) Everyone seems to be talking about the Bill Nye vs. Ken Ham debate which is occurring in a few hours. I’m not going to watch it, at least not immediately. I’m not 100% against debating creationists, but I do think science-defenders should try to not give the contest away before it even starts. For a long time I’ve been developing a list in my head of what scientists and science educators should think about even before they even agree to appear in a debate. Bill Nye made all of these mistakes at once, and therefore, even if he and his bow-tie have the best day of their lives, he’s lost on a lot of fronts already. All Ken Ham has to do to win is not break down in tears and admit he’s based his life on a horrible mistake. Therefore, here are my… TEN (well, 7 counting) COMMANDMENTS THOU SHALT THINK ABOUT, AND RESOLVE, BEFORE YOU EVEN AGREE TO DEBATE A CREATIONIST Ten Commandments for debates with creationists Convergent evolution: tenrecs and hedgehogs M. Wilson Sayres on February 4, 2014 9:47 AM | 73 Comments (new) The hedgehog and tenrec diverged from one another over 100 million years ago. To put that in perspective the lineages leading to human and mouse also diverged roughly 100 million years ago (maybe closer to 90ish). And yet, the tenrec and hedgehog have independently evolved very similar features, likely because of similar environmental pressures. This independent evolution of features is called convergent evolution, and it is just fantastic to observe.

The participants will discuss the question, “ Is teaching creationism harmful to children, society? ” at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, January 30, on WEKU of Richmond, Kentucky. It looks like you can get it streaming . I will refrain from noting that modern journalism thinks there are two sides to every question, even when there are not. Does any reader know of any other, similar warm-ups or “extended interviews”?

Wilson Sayres on January 26, 2014 9:36 PM | 13 Comments (new) Brief background: Deng et al (2014) isolated single cells from two different stains of mice, where they could detect maternal-alleles and paternal-alleles for over 82% of assayed genes (in the other genes, there were not unique variants that allowed deciphering between the two alleles). For each gene, the authors characterized whether they could detect expression from both the maternal and paternal alleles, or from only the maternal or paternal allele. Although the title says, “mammalian,” all of the experiments and analysis were conducted in mouse cells and tissues, so far as I can tell. Notes on: Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells Texas Public Schools Are Teaching Creationism Matt Young on January 25, 2014 10:52 AM | 7 Comments (new) That is the title of a Slate article by Zack Kopplin . But actually it is much worse (see also NCSE’s take here). Here are the first 3 paragraphs of Kopplin’s article. Texas Public Schools Are Teaching Creationism Former creationist looks forward to Bill Nyes debate with Ken Ham Matt Young on January 22, 2014 4:21 PM | 313 Comments (new) By David MacMillan. The author has a B.S. in physics from the University of North Alabama and once wrote a very positive review of the Creation Museum. It’s rare to see a prominent scientist or educator agree to a public debate with someone from the creation science movement. Giving equal time to both sides might be a foundational principle of American dialogue, but it paints the issue as more of a controversy than it actually is. That’s why it surprised a lot of people when Bill Nye, science educator and TV personality, agreed to debate the president of Cincinnati’s Creation Museum, Ken Ham. Former creationist looks forward to Bill Nyes debate with Ken Ham Freshwater: Reconsideration denied Richard B. Hoppe on January 22, 2014 11:57 AM | 28 Comments (new) The Ohio Supreme Court today denied John Freshwater’s motion to reconsider his appeal of the decision to terminate him as a middle school science teacher in the Mt. Vernon City Schools. This brings to an end the involvement of the state courts in the affair. (I’m on a mobile and can’t post a link to the case page-someone can do so in a comment.) Freshwater’s only remaining possibility is to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to grant cert. It’s not known whether he or the Rutherford Institute will attempt that. Freshwater: Reconsideration denied Cancer Genomics Symposium M. Wilson Sayres on January 21, 2014 4:47 PM | 25 Comments (new) I attended the Cancer Genomics Symposium, hosted at UC Berkeley ( http://qb3.berkeley.edu/ccb/cancer-[]s-symposium/ ). A lot of great research was discussed, but it really struck me that every talk highlighted the importance of understanding evolution if we are going to tackle cancer. My general take-home messages from the Symposium are: - Cancers evolve, so treatments need to keep up. - Next-generation sequencing is a sensitive diagnostic tool and allows for earlier detection. - Therapies can be fine-tuned as we understand patient-specific and tumor-specific signals.
