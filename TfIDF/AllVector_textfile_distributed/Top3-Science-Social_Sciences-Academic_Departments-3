Since 1998 we have conducted a wide range of environmental, psychological, and social science projects. We have experience working on local, state, federal, and tribal based studies, and are especially adept at working with American Indians, Alaskan and Hawaiian Natives, First Nation, and other indigenous peoples. We also publish various forms of books, manuscripts, technical documents, and other media with cultural themes. Our publishing arm, Bauu Press, has been recognized for its high quality, and we are proud of each work that is released to the public. Our books and other publications can be found in numerous university libraries, as well as bookstores, public libraries, and various retail outlets.
