 UCL Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics CCCP About the Centre The People Contact Us Our Publications Experimental Activites Theoretical Activities Astrochemical Modelling Resources AstroSurf Stars 'R' Us About the Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics The purpose of the Centre is to apply research to fundamental chemical processes which are believed to occur throughout the universe. A recent review of the activities of the Centre can be found here . Using a unique combination of theoretical and experimental techniques , such processes are investigated in the laboratory. Comparison of these results with astronomical models and observations serves to increase our knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. Our first major project concerns the formation of hydrogen molecules on surfaces of interstellar dust grains and the second expands upon this to study the formation of more complex molecules such as methanol. You can view a pdf document explaining the motivations and experimental activities of the centre here and we now have a resource available following our successful Stars 'R' Us display at the recent Royal Society Summer Exhibition. AstroSurf Network The members of the UCL Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics are also members of the AstroSurf network . AstroSurf is a network which aims to bring together surface scientists (both experimental and theoretical) and molecular astrophysicists to encourage the application of surface science techniques to problems that are of relevance to astronomy. PhD Position Available A PhD project on surface chemistry in space has become available within the CCCP working with Dr Wendy Brown in the department of chemistry at UCL. A summary of the research project can be found here . 27 May, 2008 John Edridge +44 (0)20 7679 2000 - Copyright 1999-2007 UCL Disclaimer | Accessibility | Privacy | Advanced Search | Help
