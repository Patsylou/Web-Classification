An over-arching science strategy serves to guide ECETOCÃ¢â¢s science programme and uses an issues, rather than activity-based approach. What does it involve? The premise of this strategy is that ECETOC plays an integral role in science in society. Its particular remit is to contribute objective scientific evidence to the debate about the role of chemicals in the causality of disease and assure the process of risk assessment of these chemicals. It does so via the pursuit of the following 5 broad themes: Presence of chemicals in humans Presence of chemicals in the environment Effects on humans and ecosystems Methods Science of risk assessment. This science strategy is also used as a basis for working with other stakeholders, such as academia, regulators, associations and international institutions to ensure that objective scientific evidence is used to provide the highest quality risk assessment of chemical products that minimises wherever possible the use of animals in testing. ECETOC currently pursues the following 10 strategic science areas: Presence of chemicals in humans. Chemicals in human tissue Objective: Ensure that the results of biomonitoring studies are placed into appropriate context within risk assessment to human health. Mixtures and co-exposure Objective: Contribute to the development of a pragmatic, realistic, and science-based framework for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures. Presence of chemicals in the environment Assessment of environmental fate and behaviour Objective: Develop the understanding of environmental processes that drive the fate and behaviour of chemicals and the role of these processes in risk assessment. Effects in humans and ecosystems Reproductive health Objective: Ensure that the methods and the testing strategy to identify and characterise developmental and reproductive toxicants are appropriate and optimised. Biodiversity and ecosystems Objective: Identify the key science issues relevant to risk assessment of chemicals in the environment in a way that is relevant to the potential impact on biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Methods Integrated testing strategies Objective: Contribute to a more effective approach to hazard and risk assessment. This should also support the further development and application of alternative approaches to hazard assessment, and thereby improve the workability of REACH. Good ITS approaches can reduce cost and use of animals while providing best quality data for the risk assessment process. Risk assessment of nanomaterials Objective: Develop a series of approaches for addressing health and environmental effects of nanomaterials. Science of risk assessment Role of chemicals in the causality of disease Objective: Put the presumed associations between chemicals in the environment and disease into their proper scientific perspective. The focus is particularly directed towards rigorous methodology in observational epidemiology. Risk, hazard and precaution Objective: Take into account all available scientific tools to adequately characterise risk not only based on hazard characteristics but also on exposure data and dose-response considerations. Science in society Objective: Improve public confidence in the science of risk assessment and to promote its use in public policy actions. This includes the need to counter the perceptions of bias, vested interest and lack of quality assurance of industry generated data. ÃÂ  Health Sciences Message regarding Christa Hennes Over the years, many of you will have come to know our human health sciences manager, Christa Hennes as a colleague and as a friend. It is with great sadness that we have to inform you that Christa passed away in December 2013 after a long and brave struggle with her health. Christa joined ECETOC as Health Sciences Manager in October 2002 and was Scientific Secretary to the ECETOC Scientific Committee. Christa was a wonderful, kind and generous person to work with and will be remembered for her professionalism, dedication and good- natured character. She will be missed very much by her colleagues and we send our deepest and sincerest condolences to her family. Until a new human health sciences manager can be found, Christa's activities are being managed by ECETOC's Secretary General, Dr Alan Poole Recent meetings 21-22 February 2013, Vienna, Austria: Mode of Action: Recent developments, regulatory application and future work (in co-operation with WHO-IPCS) 20 June 2012, Stockholm, Sweden: ECETOC session at EUROTOX 2012.

Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 63:53-54. doi: 10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.02.008 Environmental Sciences Environmental Sciences Manager Dr. Malyka Galay Burgos As the Environmental Sciences Manager within the secretariat of ECETOC, most of Malyka's work focuses on the current risk assessment and scientific criteria for the limits on the release of chemicals into the environment and the possible effects on human health: multiple stressors, chemical mixture assessment, laboratory to field assessment, structure-activity relationships; mechanisms of exposure and toxicity; sediment and water toxicity, methods and evaluation; risk and hazard assessment; biomarkers; mode of action of metal and xenobiotics; toxicokinetics; factors that modify toxicity; biomonitoring. For this, she also seeks ways to support the further development and application of alternative approaches to hazard assessment and thereby improve the workability of REACH and good Integrated Testing Strategy (ITS) approaches that reduce costs and the use of animals while providing best quality data for the risk assessment process. Some of her interests are in strengthening risk assessment through an evolving systems toxicology approach, utilising an understanding of chemical - biological interactions across natural compounds, emerging contaminants and potentially novel marine biotechnologies.
