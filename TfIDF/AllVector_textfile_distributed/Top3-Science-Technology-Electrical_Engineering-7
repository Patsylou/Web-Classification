 The WWW Virtual Library : Electrical and Electronics Engineering The WWW Virtual Library (VL) is the oldest catalogue of the Web, started by Tim Berners Lee, the creator of HTML and of the Web itself, in 1991 at CERN in Geneva. Unlike commercial catalogues, it is run by a loose confederation of volunteers, who compile pages of key links for particular areas in which they are expert; even though it isnt the biggest index of the Web, the VL pages are widely recognised as being amongst the highest-quality guides to particular sections of the Web.
