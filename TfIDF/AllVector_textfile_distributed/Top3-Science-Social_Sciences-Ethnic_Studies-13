We explore these issues with comparative, relational, and interdisciplinary frameworks in order to interrogate historical and contemporary questions of power, privilege, and inequity. The faculty in the Ethnic Studies Program engages in empirical and theoretical research, student centered teaching, and creative collaborations that promote social justice and challenge existing knowledge paradigms.
