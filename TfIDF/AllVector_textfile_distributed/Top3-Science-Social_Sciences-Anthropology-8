SYNOPSIS The Cultural Anthropology Program supports basic scientific research about the causes, consequences, and complexities of human social and cultural variability. Cultural anthropologists analyze human social and cultural behavior holistically. This integrated approach makes anthropology a valuable research tool for understanding the modern world.Because cultural patterns are emergent over time and space, there is no single natural scale for ethnographic and ethnological analysis. In some cases, cultural patterns may emerge from the collective behavior of large ensembles of smaller scale units; in others, they may be imposed by larger scale constraints. The origins of social and cultural variability may be remote from the scale at which they are observed. Therefore, research may target any appropriate scale or scales from local to regional to global. The Program encourages innovative research that contributes to building spatially and temporally specific theory that extends understanding beyond individual case studies. The Cultural Anthropology Program accepts proposals for a variety of project types: Senior Research proposals (that is, research proposals from scholars with PhDs or equivalent degree); proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants; Cultural Anthropology Scholars awards (for research-related, post-PhD training); and CAREER proposals. The Program will also consider proposals for workshops and training programs, as well as supplements to current awards to support Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Graduate Studies (REG). Research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology is eligible. Successful proposals are characterized by clear research questions and propositions that will be put to the test through meticulous attention to research design, data collection, and analysis.
