It also contains course material in Mammalian Histology taught by Dr. Wagner. Their are also links to animations and videos pertaining to biological structure at the microscopic level. LIGHT MICROSCOPIC IMAGES OF MAMMALIAN ORGANS AND TISSUES High magnification images of sections through mammalian tissue and organs. Most are stained with Hematoxylin and eosin but in several cases more specialized stains are used. Low magnification images taken with a Leitz Photomakroscope permit surveillance of large tissue regions giving a perspective seldom achieved with a conventional compound microscope CELL AND TISSUE ULTRASTRUCTURE Transmission and scanning electron micrographs of mammalian tissues HISTOLOGY POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS Anatomical illustrations and power point presentations of lectures given in B408 Mammlian Histology THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELS AND VIDEOS OF CELLS AND TISSUES Three dimensional models of tissues and cell types which enhance appreciation of shape and depth of histological structures Animated videos of models of biological tissues and structures rotated through 360 degrees to provide views from all angles Aliens Models Anaglyphs Colored EMs Confocal Other Worlds Footer
