 Quality Management Program/Project Management Resource List #60 Revised Feb. 2012 Provided by the NASA Headquarters Library Automobile recalls, alerts about tainted food, and complaints about the services provided by people working at different companies and government offices are, unfortunately, a part of our modern life. Quality management-the creation and enforcement of standards for goods and services-can help us to find and solve these problems before they go too far. NASA's concern with quality management reaches back to its predecessor, the NACA, which studied, among other things, the proper treatment of the fabric used to make early airplane bodies and wings. Today, ensuring the quality of components, aircraft, and spacecraft and providing efficient administrative and support services continues to be a fundamental concern for NASA. This webpage lists resources at the NASA HQ library on quality management. You may find additional resources at the library's webpage on The Benchmarking Process , Corporate Culture , Measuring Organizational Effectiveness in Research and Development Organizations , and Ethics in the Workplace . All items are available at the Headquarters Library, except as noted.
