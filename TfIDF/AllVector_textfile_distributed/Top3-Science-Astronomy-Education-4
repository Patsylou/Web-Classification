 Make a scale model of the Solar System and learn the REAL definition of "space." This Page requires a JavaScript capable browser. Fill in the diameter of the Sun you want your model to be scaled by. You can fill in either the red bordered inches box or the green bordered millimeters box. Important: Only fill in one box. If both are filled in you will get a dialog box asking you to clear one of the boxes. Use the Clear You can click on the names of the planets and satellites to go the the Nine Planets Solar System Model Body Body Diam (km) Body Diam (in) Body Diam (mm) Orbit radius (km) Scaled orbit radius (ft in) Scaled orbit radius (meters) Sun 1391900 Mercury 4866 57950000 ft in m Venus 12106 108110000 ft in m Earth 12742 149570000 ft in m Mars 6760 227840000 ft in m Jupiter 142984 778140000 ft in m Saturn 116438 1427000000 ft in m Uranus 46940 2870300000 ft in m Neptune 45432 4499900000 ft in m Pluto 2274 5913000000 ft in m Other interesting distances and speeds Quantity Real Quantity Scaled Quantity (English) Scaled Quantity (Metric) Speed of light 299792 km/sec in/sec mm/sec Light year 9.46051E+12 km mi km Distances to Stars and Galaxies To Alpha Centauri 4.03964E+13 km mi km To Sirius 8.17388E+13 km mi km To Deneb 1.32636E+16 km mi km To Galactic center 2.62151E+17 km mi km Sizes of Stars Hottest star (Type 05) 12527100 km ft m Coolest star (Type M5) 222704 km in cm Red giant (Betelgeuse) 521962500 km ft m White dwarf (Sirius B) 13919 km in mm Neutron star 20 km in mm click here OpenOffice Download OpenOffice-format spreadsheet (25 kbytes) Download Excel-format spreadsheet (45 kbytes) Links to other Solar System resources Your Age On Other Worlds Your Weight On Other Worlds The Exploratorium's "Observatory" The Nine Planets A Solar System Scale Model Meta Page.
