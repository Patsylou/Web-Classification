The group of Professor Hilvert works in the field of chemical biology. Check out the 'research' and 'publications' tabs on the right for more info about our research. The figure on the left displays two proteins we work on and an image of our HCI building and a picture of the Aletsch glacier which we visited during an exciting group hike.. We are always looking for motivated and interested PhD students and postdoctoral candidates. Please check the open positions page for application requirements. Research overview Directed Evolution Capsid engineering We are engineering non-viral and non-natural cage forming proteins to efficiently encapsulate guest molecules such as enzymes and nanoparticles. The structure and dynamics of these capsids is also being probed using various biochemical and biophysical methods. Selenocysteine Incorporation The natural or synthetic incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins and enzymes is a long standing research topic within the Hilvert Lab. Either by solid phase peptide synthesis or using the natural selenocysteine incorporation machinery several proteins are synthesized to study the effect of selenium introduction..
