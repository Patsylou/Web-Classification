Read More . Thorax, the official journal of the British Thoracic Society (BTS),is one of the world's leading respiratory medicine journals publishing clinical and experimental research articles on respiratory medicine, paediatrics, immunology, pharmacology, pathology, and surgery. Thorax is one of the highest ISI ranked journals covering all aspects of pulmonary medicine. Each issue covers topics such as COPD, asthma, smoking, respiratory infection and lung cancer; and includes editorials, short papers, review series, case reports, images in thorax, and letters.

While it's been known for over a century that iron deposits in the brain play a role in the pathology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), new imaging research from Western University helps to answer the question of whether these accumulations are a cause or consequence of the disease. The study led by Ravi Menon, PhD, of the Robarts Research Institute found iron deposits in deep gray matter, suggesting the accumulation occurs very early in the disease course. The researchers also found evidence casting further doubt on the controversial liberation therapy for MS. Dr. Brandon Disher First Graduate of the PhD Med Biop Clin MSc CAMPEP Accredited Program In 2007, Brandon Disher enrolled in theMedical Biophysics PhD program. In 2010, he was the first studentoffered admission to thePhD Med Biop Clin MScCAMPEP accreditedProgram which preparesstudents for the role of medicalphysicists and he was the first graduate of the program atWestern's Fall 2013 Convocation. Brandon is now a medical physics residentat the London Regional Cancer Centre and will write his certification examination aftertwo years of hands-on post graduate training. Take the IOMP (International Organizationfor Medical Physics) Quizzes to Celebrate the First International Day of Medical Physics on November 7th, 2013. David Jaffray, Medical Biophysics PhD graduate 1994 Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry Alumni of Distinction Award Winner Identified as one of Canadas Top 40 Under 40, and a recipient of Westerns Young Alumni Award in 2004, it can be said Dr. Jaffray has accomplished much in a short period of time. The Head of Radiation Physics at Princess Margaret Hospital and a Senior Scientist within the Ontario Cancer Institute, Dr. Jaffrays research in image-guided radiation therapy focuses on the development of novel imaging systems and concepts to improve the precision of therapy and translating these advances to clinical practice. Along with being professor in Departments of Radiation Oncology, Medical Biophysics and Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto, Dr. Jaffrays interest in commercialization has led to the development of a variety of commercial products including software and hardware.

Dr. Frank Prato TheDepartment ofMedical Biophysics ispleased to announce that faculty member, Dr. Frank Prato,who is the Imaging Program Leader andAssistant Scientific Director at Lawson Health Research institute,and Chief Medical Physicist at St. Joseph's Hospital has been awarded the prestigious D'Arsonval Award for 2013 from the Bioelectromagnetics Society (BEMS). The D'Arsonval Award recognizes outstanding achievement in research in bioelectromagnetics. The award consists of a silver medallion, a silver lapel pin, an illuminated testimonial and a US$2,000 honorarium, which are presented at the BEMS Annual Meeting. The award shall be given from time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors, but no more than one award shall be given in any one year. The sole requirement for this award is extraordinary accomplishment within the discipline of bioelectromagnetics, which can consist of exceptional scientific accomplishments or practical application of electromagnetic fields for human benefit.
