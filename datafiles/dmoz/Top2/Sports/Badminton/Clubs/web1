"Overflow" Court At this stage we have no intention of booking an extra court once the competition season is up and running - however if the numbers attending merit a review we might need to do so. Do we keep the booking system? The booking system we ran for a several months in 2013 seemed to work well and after a few early problems ran smoothly. Not once in the 6 months we had it running did we need to turn some-one away because of a booking. We still had one or two occassions when we exceeded our limits but it was because of people arriving after 8:00pm DO WE KEEP THIS GOING - IS IT WORTH THE WORK INVOLVED There are a couple of steps you can do make it easy to use. Step 1. Log on to http://apbc.eventbrite.com.au/ -- click the eventbrite logo (top left of screen) -- this takes you to a screen where you register to use the product Step 2. on this screen click on the signup box (top right of screen) and then enter a valid email address and a password...exit from this screen.
