What do you do with those pieces of string that are too short to make a bow string with? Answer: I make string keepers with those pieces. This is not a difficult project and uses string that might otherwise go to waste.

While some of the villagers stayed behind to tend the growing corn, beans, and squash, many of the People spread out through the tribes territory in small groups, fishing and gathering wild plant foods, and enjoying the warm weather.

The tournament was fully booked and some very well known names in international archery were present, besides 4 Korean archers in the Womens Recurve division, that were sent by the main sponsor WinWin. Two new records were shot, a new european record in the Mens Compound division by Mike Schloesser (598 points) and another world record for German cadet Carlo Schmitz, who topped his own world record with 594 points. He eventually won the Mens Recurve division and clinched his second win at an international indoor tournament after winning the Face2Face tournament in Amsterdam just one month ago. I had the chance to shoot some 360Â° panoramas in and around the venue, so here is a set of 8 panos, inlcuding two panos shot during the finals: Error Javascript not activated There are also regular pictures available: http://www.archeryimages.net/gallery/index.php?action=picturescid=683 Related Posts: Berlin Open Coming Up Berlin Open Updates Berlin is ready for another Round: Berlin Open 2011 Tags: 360Â° , archery , berlin , competition , indoor , open , panorama , prize money , world archery | 1 comment European Outdoor Target Championships 2012 Amsterdam (NED) Thursday, May 24th, 2012 (09:37) | Events | By: Tilman The European Championships 2012 are on since last weekend, and there are now some pictures to see in the ai gallery.

Power in Numbers EC 2007 Field uploaded Tags: amsterdam , emau , european , european championships , gallery , Pictures | No comments A Facebook for Archers rcherz.com Launched Wednesday, May 23rd, 2012 (23:10) | Lost and Found | By: Tilman RcherZ (or just rcherz ) and it is in fact a social network, especially designed for achers. Viktor Zeman and Miroslav Bojcun from the Slovak Republic are the two guys behind rcherz.com and it seems, like they mean business. Together with a hired full-time php programmer from Indonesia, they set up the site in little more than half a year and went online about two month ago in March this year. At the moment, the site is still in beta phase, but this shouldnt stay this way for long, if they continue with their pace. A lot has been going on since the beta launch in March, but still, rcherz.com (which, by the way is also accesible via http://www.archeryfriends.com) is kind of buggy and needs some final touch. The advertised features are on the other hand very promising: You can upload and share scores, create competitions and invite friends, you can keep in touch with all the archers in the world, and post about archery as much as you like, without annoying your non-archer friends on facebook. I am suprised about the professional level of rcherz.com and how serious Zeman and Bojcun are pushing their project. They obviously believe in a financial success, and they try to do it the facebook way, by offering an unconditional free service, that generates revenue via ads. Its a very different approach to archerylifestyle and it requires quite a lot of people using the service. Lets see who is still there in 5 years, lets see who got it right This is a view of the users homescreen, which actually looks a lot like Google Plus: For me, its definitely an exciting development. I am curious about what it will do for the archer community.

Brady Ellison ties the world record with 597 points with the recurve, while teammate Braden Gellenthien misses the world record with the compound by only one point and 598 points. To bad for him, the Canadian Christopher Perkins had just raised it to 599 last year!

The organization of the Berlin Open 2011 produced and uploaded videos showing the gold medal matches in the recurve and compound division in full length. You can watch the finals of Morgan Lundin (SWE) vs. Mike Schloesser (NED) Compound Men, Andrea Weihe (GER ) vs. Jelena Babinina (LTU) Compound Women, Florian Kahllund (GER) vs. Oleksandr Skachok (UKR) Recurve Men and Isabel Viehmeier (GER) vs. Polina Robionova (UKR) Women Recurve in the archeryimages gallery. Additionally, with the video material provided byÂ Harald Meyer I was able to produce a video of the elimination rounds in the womens recurve division. Its also available in the newly created youtube-channel of archeryimages: www.youtube.com/archeryimages : Last but not least, Archery TV is uploading huge amounts of video coverage of the London Olympic Test Event 2011 at the very moment. So, if you need a time filler until the world champs will go off have a look at their channel ( www.youtube.com/archerytv ) and see experienced world-class archers like the Korean Jin Hyek Oh struggling with the wind in London (GBR): Related Posts: Berlin is ready for another Round: Berlin Open 2011 Berlin Open Updates 360Â° Panoramas of Berlin Open 2012 Tags: babinina , Berlin Open , indoor , Jin Hyek Oh , kahllund , korea , london , lundin , olympic games , olympic test event , robionova , schloesser , skachok , viehmeier , weihe | No comments Older entries Pages Home Photogallery Whos Behind?
