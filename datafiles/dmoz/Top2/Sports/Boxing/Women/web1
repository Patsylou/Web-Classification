Just before the fight! Not just any fight, but his fight. Roughly two hours before fight time I got my usual check up call from Tommy Brunette to make sure everything was ok and that I was ready to go. Joey, our friend and right-hand man, was there within the hour to pick me up. My mom and I met him in the lobby and were greeted by quiet chaos. Joey calmly informed us that Tommy had a heart attack. It was stunning to say the least, but based on Joey's military manner I felt confident everything would be ok. After all, if Joey was holding up, we should all feel good, right? You see, Joey is always calm and strong on the surface. It could have something to do with his training and recent return from Iraq. He told us that Tommy was at the hospital and breathing on his own. I had confidence that the doctors and technology would take care of him, wouldn't they? We all arrived at the River City Ballroom ready to work and take over for the Brunette Family if need be. Upon arrival, we saw Kim Brunette who was clearly hurt and distressed. All I could do was hug her and tell her we would take care of everything and that they could count on us to have the Show go on! Not long after, most of them left for the hospital. Only 20 minutes before I was to go on Fox Sports Net and meet the hungry fight crowd of St. Paul, Mom looked over at me with tears in her eyes and said, He's dead. I was in shock. I really thought everything was going to be ok and it wasn't. There would be no picture taking or sales that night. I cried, we all cried. I had never experienced anything like this right before show time. All I could do was put it in my mind that this show must be excellent, for that was Tommy's dream. The show was more than great. The sell-out crowd of more than 2500 fight fans were on their feet all night. I know Tommy would have been so proud. I am so grateful to have been there and to help make that show a success. Tommy and I had big plans together and always had. A part of my spirit to continue as a ring announcer died that night too. I am sad today and I miss you Tommy. Thank you for always believing in me from the very beginning. You will forever be apart of my confidence and voice that drives me! I feel sad that writing this is all I can do for you, but I love you and will say your name proudly for the rest of my life. Lots of hugs and kisses from your girl!

From the opening frame of Last Woman Standing , the cheers of womens boxing fans can be heard overlaying the films energetic score along with the images of the two feature fighters as they go about their hard training regimens. The importance of the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in agreement with the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to limit female boxing to three weight classes in their debut games in 2012 (as distinct from the original request for five weigth classes), provides the tension in the film as the ramification of the decision begins to weigh on both women. (The three Olympic weight classes for women remain, Featherweight (51kg-112 lbs.), Lightweight (60kg-132 lbs), and Middleweight (75kg-165 lbs.). Prior to the decision, Spencer and Fortin, boxed in different weight classes. They were also the closest of friends who cheered each other on to national and international titles. With the decision by the IOC, however, it meant that the only way for either of them to compete in the Olympics was to jump up in weight class to 75kgÂ  and as Mary Spencer said, We never could have imagined that it would come down to us fighting for one spot. Structured around the events that propelled both women into successive collisions in the ring, the film covers their experiences inside and outside the squared circle as they both fought hard to represent Canada in 2012. What the films depicts is their great courage, fortitude and a will to succeed at all odds that unfortunately, put so much emphasis on winning a spot, that in Marys own estimation it left her thinking that gaining the coveted spot meant her fight had already been won leading to disappointment when she actually fought in her Olympic debut. Given that womens boxing in the 2016 Rio Games is still limited to three weight classes, the tremendous pressure that the female fighters undergo for just 36 coveted spots is almost too much to bear. The film also brings home the importance of the Olympics as the one great competition that truly legitimizes the sport for the public as well as the athletes themselves. Juliet LammersÂ Â Lorraine Price have crafted an elegant, sensitive portrayal of the struggles the two friends underwent in the run up to 2012 as well as the continuing problems that plague female practitioners of the sport. Â  Last Woman Standing had its premier in the United States at the Hot Springs Documentary film festival and was a featured entry at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Montana in mid-February. Â The film, an absolute must see , is now available for rental or purchase on multiple platforms including Â  iTunes ,Â  Amazon.comÂ  instant video, and others. The film continues to screen at various times in Canada. The films distributer,Â  Film Buff , is also arranging showings in New York City and Los Angeles. What the documentary does best, is remind us just how fabulous womens boxing truly isand of the immense pride and dedication female boxers bring every time they put on the gloves.

Even with that daily something, it is sometimes nice to have a day off! Yesterday was just such a day for mewhen somewhere late in the evening I realized I hadnt blogged for the day. Yes, I could have rushed it, but the truth wasit was okay. Sometimes that break is what we need to kick start something new. Today, my actual day off from work (the Presidents Day holiday), turned out to be a gift of another kind one extra day at the gym. I saw friends I rarely run into and had another chance to box at a leisurely pace, this time going into the ring with boxing trainer, Darius Forde . With Lennox Blackmoore in my corner to coach me through it, I worked through all sorts of issues in the ring offensively and defensively plus the different looks that Darius showed me. The rounds on the heavy bag and upper cut bag afterwards were also something a little bit new as I worked through different boxing problems I experienced in the ring. It got me to thinking that its what makes the best part of any day working through a problem from a different angle. Rather like a piece of art we get to enrich ourselves by creatively thinking through how best to make something work before moving along. At any rate, as official days off go, it was pretty wonderful.

To be honest, I was dreading it during the middle of the week, but by yesterday, my Pollyanna attitude took over and I started to think that I had a line on how to get respectably pummeled rather than the usual total pummeling! Getting to the gym a little early, I spent four rounds in front of the mirror working on my stance before heading over the slip rope to do exactly that â¦ slip. My strategy was to sit lower and use my abs more to propel my legs and to hold my body taut. It also meant that my movements were smaller and I could get my hands back faster to cover up! By the time Len came, I was very warmed up with a good sweat and when we entered the ring I felt more in control, with tighter punches and at least s-o-m-e slipping. When it came to the dreaded right hook (yep, he was fighting me southpaw again), I still didnt know how to handle it. By the third one I just said, s stop for a minute, and asked Len what I should do. What he recommended was that I weave under the punch to the left and set myself up to throw a left uppercut followed by a left hook. Talk about a wow! Who knew that old bob-and-weave actually worked as a strategy in the ring! We practiced it a few times, taking us all the way through the bell, and then went back to sparring. Â Admittedly I got tagged several more times with his right, but at least I tried to weave under itand in so doing even surprised him with a few sneaky shots of my own. By the end of five rounds I was tired, but armed with my new (old) defense, went on the uppercut bag to practice the move some more. The challenge there was timing the bag to duck under and then come up into position to set up throwing the uppercut-hook combination. It took a while, but I actually started to get it, and then used the bag to bob-and-weave on both sides. I also worked out using my stance to the point where my abs actually started to ache a bit by the end of my fourth round on the bag. Old dog, new tricks â¦ maybe, maybe not, but I certainly felt better about things. Thinking about it as I pounded on the speed bag to close out my workout, I did at least feel as if Id pushed things along, just enough to sense that maybe, one day, Ill look in the mirror and actually see a boxer looking back at me!

And as for the walk home, Adams Street near Fulton was a veritable icy lake of slush. When it comes to slip sliding along though, the real dream is avoid the punch that inevitably finds its way onto my head, not the huge piles of snow, ice and all around yuck that is our New York City winter. The good thing is, life goes on anyway and bitching and moaning aside, it is after all the 13th of February which means not toooooooo many more of these snow-laden morning and evening rush hours to go. Least ways, thats the hope. Apropos of nothing in particular, if you do have to think winterit might as well be skating where so far at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, some of the performances have been remarkable.

When I started boxing I knew little about it, though I have always enjoyed the Big televised fights growing up. Since then Ive grown to absolutely LOVE IT! Its about dedication, strength and will-power. I am diligent and have the determination to succeed. Boxing reflects my personality and I am content and fulfilled by it . It made me confident in my daily life. I have become stronger in everything, It does not matter how difficult it is. Boxing has changed me, It is my oxygen . Boxing includes intense training which improves my competitive skill. I have made great daily sacrifices to compete. A common saying in boxing is Train hard, fight easy. Focus. To become a World Champion is a achievable dream for me, reward my whole family ,friends and all who support and know me. I have great passion for the hardestÂ  game of all. The joy of pain and hard work is a part of life for any top class fighter . I have the ability and what it takes to do it. My boxing journey began when I started in a fitness boxing class offered at the gym I was working out at , I was 27 years old. My instructor a former Boxing Pro noticed my natural abilities in boxing and convinced me to consider joining a real boxing gym and learn to fight competitively . brandy badry One year after joining a boxing club I fought in my first sanctioned bout as a amateur boxer. The adrenaline rush and feelings I experienced when I first entered the ring is a feeling like nothing I had ever experienced before. I won my first bout and found a love for the intensity of competition ! Within 4 years representing Alberta I made it to the 2009 Canadian Nationals held in Trois Rivier, Montreal the best in Canada at my weight class fighting in the 57 kilo weight class(125 pounds). I did get into boxing a bit late in age, but because of my fitness level, conditioning and disciplined lifestyle. I have since realized that age is truly just a number and its never too late to try . Ive achieved milestones at an accelerated pace at a much older age than most competitors. Having success with wins in Alberta Golden Glove tournaments and finishing in the winners bracket at the Canadian Nationals. Most of the woman I have fought are much younger and have had a lot more experience than myself. My success is due to my strong work ethic and belief in myself matched with some of the best conditioning and boxing coaches who have brought me to the next level making the transition to Professional Boxing. I am returning to the ring for my next pro fight on May 31st at the Shaw Conference Centre in Edmonton,Alberta. It is going to be very exciting to fight in front of my city ,in front of all who have supported me and the boxers who have inspired me to get better along with those more novice boxers whom I may inspire to do the same and the average person/female as I was, to try something new, to try boxing. It means so much to me to help extinguish the stereo types out there about most female boxers and any age limitations in athletics. To make all who have supported me on my journey proud who have given so much of themselves for my dreams. To also motivate other females to join the sport of boxing. This is what inspires me . I never thought my lifes journey would lead me to boxing but rather my journey in boxing began when it found me, and has become the second most important thing in my life next to my family. Brandy Badry wins over bastasin Other things that I do to sweat are also ways to improve my fitness for the ring along with sport specific activities. I run,sprint,weight train, off road bike, swim , yoga, hot yoga, hit the stairs and hills HARD all over the city . Explosive work such as plyometric explosive ballistic movement training. I also love to stay active on my limited days off doing tennis, roller blading , and hiking and biking. I live a very active lifestyle and thank all the people that care enough to support me on my road to success.

Click to enlarge It took only 2 minutes and 6 seconds for Tammie Tasmanian Devil Johnson to make her mark in the MMA. With a pro boxing record of 4-3-2, many thought TAZ would want to stay on her feet with boxing pioneer Margaret McGregor at the Rumble at the Ridge XI at the Snoqualmie Casino. They were wrong. McGregor, who once beat a man in the boxing ring and sported a 6-1 pro boxing record, was also making her MMA debut. McGregor came out the aggressor, throwing a wild barage of punches. Johnson's defense prevented any real damage, as she regrouped and became the dominant fighter. An uppercut by TAZ a minute into the first caused McGregor to rethink her strategy. A takedown try was thwarted by Johnson initially. A second take down attempt sealed McGregor's fate. Johnson quickly had McGregor's back and soon the choke was in. As Johnson arched her back, McGregor tapped ending the fight that saw non-stop action leaving the crowd wanting more. Johnson notched her first victory in one try in the octogan, via rear naked choke, using a ground game no one knew she had. All that remained was the celebration as coach Ericson Acacio paraded TAZ around the cage in triumphant victory. Huge gallery of photos on TAZ's facebook fan page.

Her statement has been made working in the Mayweather Gym and being welcomed in by Floyd himself. Knight's ultimate goal is to catch the attention of promoters for women's boxing so it can become a part of the sport as much as the woman have done in MMA. Floyd and Mayweather Promotions have seen to take a positive outlook on what Ava has shown in the gym. Knight said, I have never been in a a gym with so much hunger and dedication to the sport. It is so motivating and to see how Floyd interacts with his fighters makes me want to become a part of the team. It would be great to be Mayweather Promotion's first female champion. I am dedicated to make a statement here in Las Vegas for the women. Knight also stated, I am tired of fighting in Mexico. I love how they love boxing in Mexico and it doesn't matter if your male or female, but I have had so many bad and dirty things happen in the past before fights in opponents hometowns in Mexico, it just makes me want to try harder to get female boxing back the USA. I have a huge fan base everywhere but the USA and its time to change that. Knight takes UD Loss in Lt. Flyweight Bout Ava Knight flew all the way back to Toluca, Mexico to fight the local favorite Ibeth La Roca Zamora. Knight came out to Mexico after getting the call three weeks before the fight to get ready for the tough light flyweight champion. The fight was a close one. With action going back and forth, it was a show of who could keep going forward. It was an action packed bout that was scored unfairly, but Knight accepted the loss with no animosity towards anything that had happened. La Roca is a tough Light Flyweight Champion and kept her WBC Championship that night. October 26, 2013 Knight Defeats Soto On May 11, Ava Knight defeated Linda Soto in a Technical fight by unanimous decision. It was an action packed bout with Soto relentless with coming forward to press Ava. Ava stayed calm and moved and picked her shots landing Soto with a straight right in the fourth to give her an eight count. As the fight went on both fighters seemed to feel the 10,500 foot altitude but fought hard till the end. Knight finished the bout to look untouched and is now on her journey to find her next opponent. Knight to Fight in Toluca May 11 Ava Knight will be heading back to Mexico to defend her WBC Silver World Title in the Flyweight division. Mexico has been the only place that has welcomed Ava with open arms to continue to fight in their country with respect for her fighting style, technique, and personality. Knight will take on Linda Soto out of Puerto Penasco, Sonora, Mexico. It will be an action packed fight with Mexico continuing to find a fighter to ruin Ava's raining wins on Mexico. Knight Beats Vazquez in the Rematch In a hard fought 10 round battle, Ava Knight won the WBC World Title beating Susana Vazquez. Ava weighing in at 110 lbs, took this fight wanting to see how a ten round fight would go with two good hands, because early in the previous fight, Ava's hands were injured, but a recurrence happened of injury. It was a one sided fight, but with the heart of Susana, the fight was deemed the most exciting fight of the night. With all the hard punches, Susana never backed down and swung like she was there to prove a point, and she did. Susana has proved to be one of the toughest Mexicanas in Mexico, fighting all the greatest fighters including Jackie Nava, Mariana Juarez, Ana Maria, and now Ava Knight. I truly respect Susana as a fighter and a person. We had a hard time finding an opponent and she willfully came out. She is tough and she was here to fight. I have become a fan of hers and will root for her on her upcoming fights as she goes down to 108lbs, Ava said. Knight to take on Vazquez in Rematch International Boxing Federation (IBF) Flyweight Champion and World Boxing Federation (WBC) Diamond Champion, Ava The Lady of Boxing Knight (Chico, California, 10-1-3, 5 KOs) plans on making her first 2013 fight another win on her record. With the absence of finding the few other top champions of the flyweight division capable to come out and step up, Team Knight decided to give Susana Vazquez (Toluca, Mexico, 8-7-1, 3 KOs) the rematch she wanted. In a previous interview, Susana stated, I saw the repetition of the victory of Ava Knight on Mariana Jurez and I feel that I gave a better fight against Ava. Knight injured her hand in the third round of the first fight against Susana and is hoping with full recovery and preparation; she can come out with the Knock Out she promised in the first fight. Ben Bautista has been working on power and precision in the ring to make this fight easier than the first saying, Susana is a great, strong fighter and deserves a lot of respect for wanting to get back in the ring with Ava, but we will show her no mercy in the ring. Knight followed by saying, I want to make 2013 the year I prove to the world that I have Knock Out power and its time to step it up and show it. The fight titled Llegga a Chihuahua will be on Mexican television network, Televisa, January 26, as part of their weekly boxing series, Sabados de Coronas. It will be taking place at the Gimnasio Manuel Bernardo Arguirre and presented by Promociones del Pueblo, HG Boxing, and Grupo Modelo.

Ava wins WBC Diamond Belt and Succesfully defends IBF World Title along with Winning the Flyweight Crown On October 13, 2012 at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, Ava Knight (111 lbs) won the WBC Diamond Flyweight title with a ten-round unanimous (97-93,96-94,97-93) decision over Mariana Juarez (112 lbs) of Mexico. WOMENS IBF BOXING CHAMPION AVA KNIGHT WINS IN MEXICO Knight defeated Susana Vazquez by unanimous decision to retain her IBF Flyweight Title. TORREON, COAHUILA DE ZARAGOZA, MEXICO, June 30 On Saturday night, International Boxing Federation (IBF) Flyweight Champion, Ava The Lady of Boxing Knight made her second successful title defense, defeating Susana Vazquez by unanimous decision at the Auditorio Centenario. The three judges sitting at ringside scored the bout 99-91, 98-92, and 98-92, all in favor of Knight. Knights record improved to 9-1-3, with 5 KOs, and Vazquez saw her record fall to 8-7-1, with 3 KOs. Knight talked about her fight against Vazquez. She said, Susana was a very tough fighter. I thought she was aggressive and she moved around well. She tried to pull me into a brawl during the fight, but my jabs and outside punches proved to be successful. She did a good job in taking a lot of good, solid shots. Our fight was full of action. Ben Bautista, Knights trainer and manager, said, I felt Ava did what she had to do to win the fight. We knew we had the reach, speed and power advantages, and the stick was going to be the key to the fight and she was able to use the stick effectively to set up her punches and keep her opponent off of her. I did see why Susana was a tough opponent for Arely [Mucino] and Mariana [Juarez]. She is very durable and has a tough chin. Susana is not going out without a fight. I thought Ava dominated the fight. I did think two of the judges were being generous by awarding Susana two rounds. With the win, Knight looks ahead to her next challenge as a champion. She said, I have now made 2 successful title defenses in the flyweight division. Hopefully, Ill get in the ring with another strong opponent to test my skill and will. I only want to be in the ring with people I can learn from. Coach Bautista agreed with Knight, but understands that she is still developing as a boxer. He said, Ava is still a work in progress. Rome wasn't torn down in a day and it sure wasn't rebuilt in a day. Its going to take time to put together a complete package. We will go back to the gym to work on areas we need to improve in her game, and she will continue to get better, because she also sees what needs to be polished.She did show improvement in this fight.I was really impressed by how she used her jab as her offense and defense. Bautista then went on to share a glimpse of Team Knights future plans. He said, We still want to fight the best in the flyweight division and compete for all the titles. The biggest fight for Ava would be her rematch against Ana Marie Torres, but Ana is pregnant, so our plans to fight her change a bit. We just have to wait until she returns to the boxing ring. We know that many fans want to see Ava versus Melissa McMorrow, since they both hold titles in the same weight division and are training in the Bay Area. Before that can happen, McMorrow must first rematch Susi Kentikian. We would like to fight Mariana Juarez next, then after that, we can fight the winner of McMorrow versus Kentikian. Knight thanked her fans and the media for all their coverage. She said, I just want to thank all of the my fans for their kind words and thank the media for putting out articles in support of myself and women's boxing. I only hope to recover to bring better fights and more action to the sport. Bautista added, We would like to acknowledge SFC Boxing Gym and HG Promotions. We would also like to thank our sponsors, Muscle Milk, Nike, and Fire apparel. Ava Knight was born and raised in Chico, California, where her boxing training began at the age of thirteen.

Knights 10-round, IBF title defense will be featured on the Mexican television network, Televisa, as part of their weekly boxing series, Sabados de Coronas. The fight card titled Noche de Guerreros (Night of the Warriors) is presented by Promociones del Pueblo, HG Boxing, Kochul Montiel Producciones, and Grupo Modelo. Mexican boxing stars Marco Antonio Rubio, undefeated Roberto Ortiz, and Katia Gutierrez will also be featured on the card (in separate bouts). Ava Knight was born in Chico, California, to a Polish mother and an African-American father. A female friend introduced her to the sport of boxing by regularly taking her to a local gym and by the age of thirteen, Knight began her boxing training. Joe Rodriguez, her first boxing coach, bestowed upon her the nickname, The Lady of Boxing, because of her respectful and polite demeanor in the gym. Rodriguez, his son, Louis, and Avas father, Eliot, helped train Knight for eight years, and are credited with producing Avas strong boxing fundamentals. Knight had a stellar amateur career, which included wins over the 110 lb. Golden Gloves Champion and the National P.A.L. 114 lb. champion (twice) in 2006. She won the flyweight silver medal at the 2006 National Amateur Championships and was also a two-time San Francisco Golden Gloves titlist. Her amateur career record was an impressive 28-4. On August 30, 2007, at the age of nineteen, Knight made her professional boxing debut, with a unanimous decision victory against Leonie Hall. Since then, Knight has defeated two current world champions, Kaliesha West in 2008, and Arely Mucino in 2011. Her only loss came in 2009, at the hands of another world champion, Ana Maria Torres. During the fight with Torres, Knight was ailing from a back injury and had food poisoning, but still managed to go the distance. In 2010, Ava Knight moved to the SFC (Straight Forward Club) Boxing Gym in San Francisco, California, under the guidance of her current boxing trainer and manager, Ben Bautista. On October 29, 2011, with Bautista in her corner, she defeated the previously unbeaten IBF Flyweight Champion, Arely Mucino, with a second round knockout.Knight last fought on March 31, 2012, when she made her first successful IBF Flyweight title defense against Thailands Hongfah Tor Buamas.Knight dominated every round of the fight with Buamas, landed an abundance of punishing blows, and eventually won by TKO in the tenth and final round. Now twenty-three years old, Knight makes her second IBF title defense on the June 30 fight card. Her opponent, Susana Vazquez, has lost six times in her career, but five of those losses were to four different world champions, Ana Maria Torres, Jackie Nava, Mariana Juarez (twice), and Arely Mucino. Team Knight is prepared to face a battle-tested Vazquez. Knight said, Vazquez is a very tough opponent. She has been in the ring with many great Mexican boxing stars; some that I hope to fight someday. I am training hard to make our fight a short one, but if that isnt the case, I have been in the gym, grinding hard, to make sure we go out with a unanimous decision. I never take anyone lightly, and plan on giving the fans all they can handle. Coach Ben Bautista said, Susana Vazquez is definitely a tough and worthy opponent.She has been in there with the best and has been in close fights with them.Ava is prepared to overcome Susana's efforts in the ring. In preparation for this fight, Knight left her home in Chico and had a multi-week training camp in the Bay Area. Knight said, Training camp has been going great. My coach, Ben Bautista, has been hard at work, sharpening my skills and making adjustments for our opponent. I traveled to the many Bay Area Boxing Gyms in order to get in the ring with the best boxers in the area. My father, Eliot Knight, was a great help to me in camp and its great to keep him involved in my career. Bautista added, Training Camp has been on point.Ava has followed the script that I laid out for her.She has been free from distractions and is mentally focused on winning.We worked on many things in camp that centered on enhancing her skills and elevating her mental capabilities.Ava is still a work in progress, but she is striving to become a complete fighter. Team Knight is excited to return to Mexico, where they have been well received by their passionate boxing fans. Ava said, I am very happy to be traveling back to Mexico. I love the atmosphere and the excitement from the fans. I am glad that Hector Garcia of HG Boxing is giving me the opportunity to showcase my talent on television. This will give many countries across the world the opportunity to see a great night for womens boxing. Bautista agreed and said, I love fighting in Mexico.HG Promotions always takes care of us and the Mexican people have a whole lot of love for boxing.They have shown us that you don't have to be Mexican for them to love you. They will support a fighter who is willing to bring it every time they enter the ring, and I think that is why they love Ava. Her fan base in Mexico is growing at a fast rate. Team Knight hopes that the womens boxing in America eventually catches up to the popularity it receives in Mexico. Knight said, It is a shame that the United States hasnt jumped on the wagon with televising female boxing, but Im happy that other countries are willing to pick up our slack. Other countries are being entertained by displaying women that can fight and put on great shows. Womens boxing is taking a big step with finally being added to the Olympics this year, and I am very happy that I am witnessing this day. A lot of women work very hard, and give up a lot of opportunities to be involved in this sport. There appears to be some steps being taken toward some type of equality and I am very happy about that. Coach Bautista gave his opinion on the sport. Women's boxing is getting better, but still not close to getting the same respect as men's boxing. Hopefully, by making great matches like the last Ava Knight vs. Kaliesha West world title fight, which was the best female fight I ever witnessed, and by bringing similar fights to a major television network, the situation will change. Also, by showcasing women's boxing in the Olympics, it will excite more fans and invite more females to participate in the sport. With a growing fan base, perhaps more promoters will be enticed to get involved with womens boxers and give them more decent wages. Knight is thankful for everyone that has supported her in preparation for this fight. Knight said, I have to thank Coach Ben, SFC Boxing Gym, Boxing for Health, all the media, friends, family, and fans in Chico, the Bay Area, the U.S., Mexico, and all over the world for all the support I have received. I would like to thank Muscle Milk and Nike for their sponsorship. I am grateful to anyone that sent me a kind message or helped me in any way.

The 23-year-old Knight pounded her way to a 10th-round technical knockout over Thailands Hongfah Tor Buamas . Ava Knight did a great job     staying busy the whole fight, landing crisp, hard punches to the     Thai. Hongfah Tor Buamas tried to retaliate on many occasions,     being successful at times---but her punches lacked the power to     hurt Ava or tilt the fight in her favor. Ava stated, I went to the body early and tore the body all through the rounds and she just stayed up, she wouldn't go down. She was really tough, but after my coach said take her out, I decided to go all out in the last round and show everyone what I was about.

Hongfah Tor Buamas, thanked everyone for being there while stating she had more experience and was not scared to face Ava Knight in the ring. Ava kindly took the floor and said ...we trained hard so we could create the same results as last time. As the conference went on a statement was mentioned about fighting Ana Maria Torres again in a rematch. Ava Knight stated, ...we have to look at one fight at a time. We are fighting Hongfah right now, but we do want our rematch in the near future.

Ava Knight To Defend Title Against Hongfah Tor Buamas-March 31 On March 31, in Los Cabos, Mexico, Ava Lady    of Boxing Knight will be fighting Hongfah Tor Buamas. The two are    fighting 10 rounds with Ava defending her IBF Flyweight title. In    another title bout, Ana Maria Torres defending WBC Super flyweight    title against Maria Andrea Miranda. FEMALE FIGHTER OF THE YEAR 2011 We ended the year 2011 with a 2(2)-0-1 record. After a 16-month layoff, Knight (7-1-3, 4 KOs) finally came back into action in the game she knows best. In January, at 110-lbs she knocked out Gloria Salas, followed by an exciting draw with Kaliesha West five months later, that almost won her the WBO bantamweight title. But all things happen for a reason, and moving up in weight may not have been her calling. In October, Ava traveled to Colima Mexico, where she Knocked Out Arely Mucino in the second round for the IBF flyweight title. The belt was Knights first world title, making the 112-pounder the fifth reigning champ in NorCal. Ava Knight has had a hard time, moving from Chico to the big City to train and become the great boxer she is now. Every boxer has to have a foundation which to stand on and to keep her ring of support strong. SFC has been her home now for the last two years and she has been able to continue chasing her dream of becoming pound for pound champion. She has been under Coach Ben Bautista's wing for some time now and has become a part of their net of champions inside and outside the ring at SFC. Ben Bautista has earned his spot as Northern California Amateur Coach of the year because of his constant presence on the amateur scene, with Central Pacific District middleweight champion Aaron Coley and National PAL female middleweight bronze medalist Raquel Miller. Maintaining these duties while holding a post as Northern California Regional Director for USA Boxing, Ben doesnt look to stop anytime soon.

The fight ended in a second round knock out that ended the fight with a bang. Ava Knight: I walked into that fight confident. I knew that if I wanted to win fare and square, I would have to come out with a knock out because I didn't want any questions to who really won. Coach Ben Bautista of San Francisco had a plan, and we executed it exactly how we wanted to. Camp was hard, long, and a three hour drive back and forth from Chico to SF for training was brutal, but it was part of my road to becoming champion. I knew this was my chance to grab a title at a weight class I have been yearning to fight in since I started. Flyweight is my natural weight class, walking around at 114, so staying at this weight class strong is what I aim to do. I feel no one can beat me in the flyweight division and I am determined to stay Champion after 5 long years of being a professional and going through some tough fights that most girls don't see until they reach super star status. The actual fight was short. The first round for me was a feel out round. I wanted to see what she was planning on doing and where she was going to be throwing her punches from. It was a close round, we were both being cautious and watching each other. The second round I noticed the difference in facial expression. After being hit, I saw that she didn't want to exchange anymore. I felt strong, and she was getting a taste of what a real flyweight feels like in the ring. I saw my openings and came in and executed a combination that ended in a straight right hand that dropped her to the floor, which the referee called a slip. After that moment I thought, I'm not going to get my knock downs counted for so it's time to get to work. I came in with a body punches that ended with a left hook to the head that took her out. The referee waived the fight off immediately and her corner and the doctor came in to help her. Concerned about her safety, my corner and I all took a knee and prayed, and when finished, we came up paid our respect to her and enjoyed our victory. I am very proud to take home a championship to the people who have paid so much attention, time and love to bring me to this point in my life. I've always heard that I was going to be a world champion, and now I can finally say that I am. I have come to realize that boxing brings people together like family. My boxing family is a large one, but complete in the sense that I only need them to venture on the journey to get me to the top and stay there. Boxing is a lonely sport, so the team that backs you up are the people who care enough to put in time and work to see you succeed. Thank you all for the support and love I have felt for the work that I have been put in. Thank you to my team, SFC, my coach Ben Bautista, sparring partners,the promoter Hector Garcia for the opportunity, Team Mucino for coming into the ring, and Improve Balance Bands for sponsoring me for my training camp. I will work hard every day to live my life as a champion and to keep this world title in my hands.
