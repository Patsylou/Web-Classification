Monday February 25, 2013 As expected, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has selected WBC interim welterweight champ Robert Guerrero as his May 4 opponent at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. What was unexpected was the announcement that Mayweather would be leaving HBO for a big revenue-sharing deal with Showtime. Guerrero believes Mayweather - now 36 - is "ripe for the picking". Oddsmakers obviously feel otherwise as Guerrero opened as an 11-1 underdog. The Guerrero fight is the first of what was reported to be up to six Showtime fights over the next 30 months. There's no shot Mayweather will suddenly start fighting that frequently as he has fought exactly twice in the past 30 months and his last six fights span a total of six years. Nevertheless, imagine how good it would be for boxing if it's pound-for-pound number one to be more active and to fight the opponents he should be Dream Half Dozen for Mayweather Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez Manny Pacquiao Sergio Martinez Gennady Golovkin Andre Ward Comments (4) Permalink Share Mayweather vs. Devon Alexander in May? Wednesday February 13, 2013 Add welterweight beltholder Devon Alexander to the list of possible opponents for the coveted May 4 date with Floyd Mayweather Jr. Robert Guerrero Comments (1) Permalink Share Poll: Who Should Floyd Mayweather Fight Next? Wednesday January 30, 2013 Floyd Mayweather Jr. has indicated he plans on fighting twice in 2013, with the first bout taking place on May 4. All he needs to do now is pick an opponent. Speculation is that he'll face Robert Guerrero first and then Saul Alvarez later in the year ... assuming, of course, that both Mayweather and Alvarez win (and don't get injured) on May 4. Once again, it's a schedule that doesn't include Manny Pacquiao , but many fight fans have stopped holding their breath for that match-up. In fact, the window for getting the general public excited about that fight is closing rapidly. Mayweather and Pacquaio avoiding each other in their respective primes - blame whoever you want - will go down as one of the biggest missed opportunities in recent sports history. So - other than Pacquiao - who would you like to see Mayweather face on May 4? Robert Guerrero? Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez? Timothy Bradley ? Someone else? Vote in our poll and let us know.

Despite having signed my part of the agreement to fight Floyd in early December, Ive been preparing myself for some time that the match up with him wasnt going to happen, as I announced on Twitter a few days ago. Therefore, this announcement did not come as a surprise. I am, however, very disappointed with Floyd and his team for not providing any explanation as to why he delayed the announcement for so long and ultimately avoided the fight with me. Clarification, if he was not fighting me, would have allowed me to look over my options and pursue another path, rather than the ultimate delay to my career this has caused.

Czar went on to face Garrett Wilson at Turning Stone and won via unanimous decision in ten rounds. Now on March 15, the much anticipated fight between the veteran Adamek and the young challenger, Adameks former sparring partner, Glazkov will finally take place at Sands Resort and Casino in Bethlehem, PA and will be aired on NBCSN Fight Night starting at 9:00 PM ET. The fight represents a crossroads for both fighters: Adamek, 37, is facing questions about whether or not he is entering the twilight of his career and the undefeated Glazkov, 29, is taking on his first real challenge in the heavyweight division. The fight will be Adameks second defense of his IBF North American heavyweight title and an eliminator for the #2 position in the IBF heavyweight ratings.

Mayweather, who celebrated his 37th birthday today, set in motion a flurry of online polls following a message posted to his Twitter and Instagram accounts (@floydmayweather) on Sunday, Feb. 2 asking fans to voice their opinion on his next opponent.

Floyd Mayweather: Marcos Maidanas last performance immediately brought him to my attention. He is an extremely skilled fighter who brings knockout danger to the ring. I think this is a great fight for me and he deserves the opportunity to see if he can do what 45 others have tried to do before him beat me. Marcos Maidana: I am extremely happy to be facing Floyd Mayweather because it will give me the opportunity to show the world that I am the best welterweight in the division. I just handed a great defensive fighter his first loss and I plan to do the same to Mayweather. I dont care whether hes the best and undefeated. I will bring some real Latino power to him on May 3rd.

Santiago On Sunday night at The Mansion Elan, Route 30 Promotions presented a great night of boxing in Atlanta GA. Billed as Sunday Night Fights Pain and Pleasure, the card was highlighted by undefeated Quatavious Cash (8-0 5KO) vs. Leo The Raging Lion Laudat (8-13 8KO) in the main event. The co-main event featured Will Farley (4-0 2KO) vs Mexicos Jesus La Sombra Tavera (5-5 1KO). In the main event, Quatavious Cash was simply too fast and skilled for the overwhelmed Leo Laudat. From the opening bell of their scheduled six round super welterweight matchup, Cash used his impressive speed to unleash three and four punch combinations that seemed to catch Laudat by surprise. The onslaught continued in the second round. Behind a steady stream of shots to the body and head, Cash landed a devastating uppercut that wobbled Laudat. On wobbly legs Laudat was in survival mode as Cash pressed on. After another barrage of shots referee Jim Korb stepped in at 2:34 of round two and stopped the fight. After the fight Cash told Fightnews.com, after suffering a gunshot wound last year I wasnt too happy with my victory in August, but now Im back and Im looking to make a lasting impression as I climb the ranks in the welterweight division.

In the main event, local fan favorite Alexis Santiago (16-3-1, 7KOs) boxed his way to a unanimous decision over tough Tijuana fighter Hanzel Rude Boy Martinez (20-2, 16KOs) for the WBC USNBC bantamweight title over ten rounds. What turned into a war was Santiagos first defense of the belt he captured last year. Santiago captured the vacant belt in a hometown rivalry when he defeated Alex Rangel via a ninth round stoppage in the same venue in September of last year. Hanzel actually had held the same belt last year but was stripped when he wasnt able to defend it.

Stay tuned February 24th, 2014 Rachman and Amol win in Papua By Jeff Pamungkas Former WBA and IBF minimumweight champion Muhammad Rachman (64-11-5, 34 KOs) has successfully returned to the ring by defeating Thongthailek sor Tanapinyo of Thailand (18-15, 7 KOs) Saturday night to seize the vacant IBO International jr flyweight title at Waringin Sports Hall in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia, located on the island of New Guinea in the eastmost part of the country. The 42-year-old veteran Rachman took over in the middle of the fight, knocking down his opponent three times (rounds eight, eleven and twelve) before referee Phil Austin finally stopped the bout in the last round. m satisfied that I can still perform my best skill, stamina and strength at my age. I still want to win a world title with the WBA, WBC, IBF or IBO once more before Im retired, Rachman told this writer via a long distance call. Rachman also performed as the promoter of the event. In the main undercard bout, light flyweight Heri Amol (33-14-4, 13 KOs) knocked out the aggressive Thai Yuthtajak Sithsaitong (reportedly 10-1, 9 KOs) in round three of the scheduled non-title ten round bout. Both fighters decided to fight in a close distance and traded punches from the beginning of the fight, but Amols right uppercut to the jaw ended Sithsaitong. February 23rd, 2014 Shimmell Dominant, Garcia Toughs It Out Story and Photos by Bob Ryder Local favorites Jordan Shimmell and Johnny Garcia came through for their fans and promoter Two Fist Promotions in winning their contests before an enthusiastic crowd at the DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids Saturday night. In the 10 round main event, cruiserweight Shimmell moved up to heavyweight for this show and faced Damon Reed of Topeka, Kansas. Despite his extensive experience, Reed had little to offer against Jordan as Shimmell dominated the contest. Reed attempted to get Jordan off his game with some veteran tricks and inside rough housing to no avail. Reed took a knee for the first knockdown in the second round after absorbing a hard body blow. In the third it was all one way action as Shimmell scored three knockdowns for the automatic TKO at 1:59 of the round. Shimmell advances to (13-0, 11 KOs) and there was talk of a possible TV fight in the near future for the former decorated amateur star. Reed slides down to (47-18, 32 KOs).

Nelson told The Daily Record how he is sure his fighter will beat Crawford and then make the move up to the 140 pound division to win a belt there. If Burns were able to do this, he would become the first Scottish boxer to win world titles in three different weight classes. Burns, the reigning WBO lightweight ruler, previously held the WBO super-featherweight crown. Of course, the classy fast-handed Crawford has plans to ruin Burns lofty goal.

All $25s are gone he said. #boxing Dan Rafael (@danrafaelespn) February 25, 2014 In what you would have to interpret as a negative sign, former WBA/WBC light middleweight champion Saul Alvarezs March 8th fight against Alfredo Angulo (22-3, 18 KOs) still hasnt sold out the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada despite having been on sale for quite some time. As you can see, there are still 2 thousand tickets remaining for the fight with a little less than 2 weeks to go before the bout. Considering that this fight is going to be sold on Showtime pay-per-view as well, this could mean that fight fans wont be interested in purchasing it.

Alvarez | 5 Comments Tomasz Adamek Gears Up to Face Young Challenger By Main Events | Published February 25, 2014 | 5 Comments Last November veteran Tomasz Adamek (49-2-0, 29 KOs) was scheduled to take on the up-and-coming Ukrainian 2008 Olympic bronze medalist Vyacheslav Glazkov (16-0-1, 11 KOs) at Turning Stone Resort and Casino in Verona, NY when Adamek fell ill and had to pull out just days before the fight. Czar went on to face Garrett Wilson at Turning Stone and won via unanimous decision in ten rounds. Now on March 15, 2014 the much anticipated fight between the veteran Adamek and the young challenger, Adameks former sparring partner, Glazkov will finally take place at Sands Resort and Casino in Bethlehem, PA and will be aired on NBCSN Fight Night starting at 9:00 PM ET. The fight represents a crossroads for both fighters: Adamek, 37, is facing questions about whether or not he is entering the twilight of his career and the undefeated Glazkov, 29, is taking on his first real challenge in the heavyweight division. The fight will be Adameks second defense of his IBF North American heavyweight title and an eliminator for the #2 position in the IBF heavyweight ratings .

There is a respectable number of boxing fans suggesting that Adrien Broner wasnât himself that night, and that maybe Marcos Maidana simply got lucky, but all that seems irrelevant after seeing Maidana make an easy night of an opponent that was supposed to be the next virtuoso in the sport of boxing. While the idea of Maidana vs. Mayweather Jr. was born, there was another name that has been carefully and consistently attaching itself to the Mayweather Jr. fight for a long time: Amir Khan.

In selecting Maidana, Mayweather opted to turn his back to his own poll on the mayweatherpromotions.com website, which saw Khan as the winner.

Despite 101 wins and 79 knockouts, he is still hungry and tenacious after decades in the fight game. At age 42, Campas (101-17-3) is a Mexican fighting legend. He has faced several critical moments of truth. He doesnât plan to linger in our midst in a lesser form. He will be back at work on April 5 in Montana, on the road to perhaps another marquee shot. Born in Sonora, Mexico, Luis Ramon Campas stacked up a 37-0 record (34 knockouts) before his 21st birthday. Continue reading More boxing news on: Yory Boy Campas | 10 Comments An Aging Fighter By Robert Jackson | Published February 24, 2014 | 22 Comments Weve all seen our aging hero lose one they shouldnt have lost or wouldnt have lost 2 or 3 years earlier. Weve seen that same guy taking punches that he wouldve eluded 5 or 6 years ago. And weve heard all of the pundits comment on whether our guy mightve gotten old over night, and today is not the fighter he was since his last fight. But Im here to tell you no fighter gets old overnight, the signs were there but were ignored. As a man over 40 Im here to tell all of you young pipsqueaks, that age creeps in between 35 and 40. At 35 you can still do pretty much 75% 85% of what you could do at age 20 if you try real hard (maybe even 90% if youve really taken care of yourself). At age 40 you wonder where your youth went, those tired legs, sore muscles and aching back never seem to get better, its like youre always tired for no explainable reason especially when it comes to sports and activity.

Floyd Mayweather Junior turns 37 today By James Slater | Published February 24, 2014 | 119 Comments Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Junior celebrates his 37th birthday today. While fight fans the world over await â? belated announcement on just who he will fight on May 3rd, Mayweather has been enjoying his birthday by taking in a game and betting some big bucks as he loves to do. Whoever Floyd winds up fighting next, and in subsequent fights post May 3rd, most if not all people fully expect him to be able to keep his perfect unbeaten record; partly because of his boxing brilliance, partly because of Mayweatherâs unwillingness to take any risks (by fighting Manny Pacquiao, or making a historic move up to middleweight and a potentially rough fight with Gennady Golovkin these two fights being those most fans bring up as the ones theyâd most like to see Mayweather take).

By Vivek Wallace | Published February 24, 2014 | 254 Comments Melvin A. (Cincinnati, OH): It appears Mayweather will take the Maidana fight. We havent seen Mayweather against a really fast fighter since Judah, so I liked Khan as the option. Why Maidana? And how can you explain your Facebook comment that this fight will be ? Vivek W. (ESB): How can I support Maidana as the option? Pretty easily, actually! In only three words I can lay out a case far stronger than any most would use to combat it: HE EARNED IT! I can understand questions relative to how Guerrero, or even Ortiz landed a shot; but with Maidana, theres no such question. The guy earned it! When we look at Maidanas past, what I like is the fact that this is a fighter who has been through all the elements of the sport. He has celebrated victory and dealt with the torment relative to defeat. Through it all, hes still standing, and making great improvement every time he enters the ring. Robert Garcia has done a very admirable job with him, and the victory over Broner was proof of this.

The fight will the be televised by Showtime, and its going to give the 30-year-old Shumenov a lot of publicity to either shine or look bad against the 49-year-old Hopkins. Shumenov is getting Hopkins at the right time in his career, as Hopkins didnt look so great in his last fight against his mandatory challenger Karo Murat last October. Hopkins won that fight by a fairly lopsided 12 round unanimous decision, but Hopkins was hit more in that fight than he had in many years. Murat was able to get in close and nail Hopkins with a lot of shots to the head.

While Burns has talked about having come up what he feels is the perfect plan to beat the 26-year-old Crawford, it just doesnt seem all that likely that those plans will pan out for the 30-year-old Scotland born Burns. Crawford has every advantage that you can think of in this fight against Burns, and the only thing that Burns has going for him is hometown advantage. Fighting at home seemed to save Burns from losing his last fight against Raymundo Beltran last September, as Burns was dominated thoroughly from start to finish in that fight but was still given a 12 round draw for his efforts. However, its highly unlikely that this fight will result in another controversial decision.

On paper the evening looked promising with a few intriguing match-ups but nobody could possibly have been expecting the drama and excitement that ran through pretty much the whole of the four hour broadcast. There is one fighter who featured on the bill whom I want to pay particular attention to but first I will briefly run through the eveningâs action. The first bout was a contest for the British super-bantamweight title, vacated by Kid Galahad as he seeks European honours, between Gavin McDonnell and Leigh Wood.

Freddie Roach was named the BWAA trainer of the year. The problem with Roach winning that award is there were, at minimum, three and possibly five trainers who accomplished more in 2013 than Freddie Roach did.Here are the trainers who were more deserving than roach of Trainer of the Year honors for 2013: FEBRUARY 24, 2014 BOXINGTALK'S KO FIX: AMIR IMAM SENDS JARED ROBINSON OUT OF THE RING In Cleveland on Showtime's ShoBox broadcast, Amir Imam registered his twelfth consecutive knockout in the fourth round with a brutal straight right that sent Jared Robinson through the ropes and out of the ring. Imam, a junior welterweight from Albany, New York, continually backed Robinson against the ropes in the small ring. In the fourth, Imam (13-0, 12 KOs) landed a combination that staggered Robinson, followed by the vicious straight right that sent Robinson out of the ring. Robinson (14-1, 6 KOs) appeared to fall on his head near the water bucket in Imams corner but he beat the twenty count, making it into the ring at eleven. However, he unsteady as he climbed back in to the ring so referee Jim Howe halted the bout. source: showtime press release FEBRUARY 23, 2014 KHAN OR MAIDANA: WHO WILL MAYWEATHER CHOOSE AND WHY? By Rob Soucy With Floyd Mayweather on the verge of announcing an opponent forhis May 3rd pay-per-view show, the boxing world continues to debatewho is more worthy ofgetting the lucrative opportunity to face the sport's pound-for-pound best. Will it be Amir Khan of the United Kingdom or Marcos Maidana of Argentina? With the fight still 11 weeks away, it seems like there is a good possibility that Mayweather and Showtime are waiting for next Friday night to make the announcement live on air.On that night,Mayweather Promotions will put on SHowtime;s ShoBox event in upstate New York, headlined by JLeon Love vs. Vladine Biosse. Maywaether could very well be in attendance to make the announcement in front of Showtime;s carmera. Healso couldmake the announcement on Monday, February 24th, which happens to be his 37th birthday. FEBRUARY 22, 2014 ZOU SHIMING NOW 4-0 WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE IN CHINA Zou Shiming KO7 Yokthong Kokietgym ... In Macao, China, former Olympic champion Zou Shiming put on a stromg performance, getting his first professional stoppage in his fourth pro bout. The 32 year-old flyweight from China floored a nineteen year-old Thai named Yokthong Kokietgym three times en route to a seventh-round stoppage. Yokthong has a still-impressive record at 15-4, but nearly all of his wins came against undocumented opponents. Shiming is now 4-0 and his promoter, Top Rank, may have located an easy path to a world title: the vacant IBF flyweight title was recently claimed by the undistinguished Amnat Ruenroeng of Thailand. Shiming would be a favorite to beat Ruenrong despite having never fought more than seven rounds. source: global post FEBRUARY 22, 2014 AMIR IMAM SENDS OPPONENT OUT OF RING ON SHOBOX Amir Imam TKO4 Jared Robinson... In the ShoBox opener from Cleveland, Amir Imam registered his twelfth consecutive knockout in the fourth round with a brutal straight right that sent Jared Robinson through the ropes and out of the ring.Robinson applied pressure in the opening rounds, leaving himself open to power shots that Imam, a junior welterweight from Albany, New York, continually landed to back up Robinson against the ropes in the small ring. In the fourth, Imam (13-0, 12 KOs) landed a left combo that staggered Robinson, followed by the vicious straight right that sent Robinson out of the ring. Robinson (14-1, 6 KOs) appeared to fall on his head near the water bucket in Imams corner but he beat the twenty count, making it into the ring at eleven. However, he unsteady as he climbed back in to the ring so referee Jim Howe halted the bout. He was off balance so I think it was a good stoppage, Imam said. If the ref didnt stop it then I would have just had to stop him on my own.Robinson, who said he felt fine in his locker room following the knockout, didnt disagree with Howes decision.My eyes were never closed but I was rocking myself back and forth to climb back in the ring, Robinson said. It probably would have taken me a few more rounds to get my wits back but I was back in the ring in time. source: showtime press release FEBRUARY 22, 2014 LUNDY WINS BIG IN CLEVELAND By Scott Shaffer Hank Lundy W10 Angelo Santana... In Cleveland, Ohio, Hank Lundy dominated Angelo Santana over ten lightweight rounds. Lundy floored Santana late in the fight to clinch the points win, and all three judges saw it 98-91 in Lundy's favor. Santana, troubled all fight by slippery footwear, has now lost two in a row. According to Showtime's press release, Lundy (23-3-1) said afterwards,I put on a boxing clinic in there. The only thing he could get was the stuff I gave him. It was kind of easy in there. I just wish I hit the body a little more because I could have stopped him.Santana, who has now lost back-to-back bouts to fall to 14-2, did not disagree with the judges decision.m not going to argue it. He didnt surprise me; it was just an off night. m disappointed but Ill be back. source: shobox FEBRUARY 21, 2014 KHAN THINKS MAYWEATHER WILL FIGHT MAIDANA A frustrated Amir Khan thinks he's lost the chance to fight Floyd Mayweather on May 3rd because, he believes, Mayweather has decided to fight WBA welterweight titlist Marcos Maidana instead. Khan foolishly pulled out of an IBF welterweight title challenge of Devon Alexander in December, afraid he might lose to Alexander and blow a chance at Mayweather. Instead, Khan has wasted nearly a year of his prime. Khan took to Twitter to complain: "No response from Mayweather or his team. Fights not happening. I should of taken the title fight last December against Alexander...Can I apologies [apologize] to the thousands of people who are let down. You me and everyone wanted the Mayweather fight. He's running scared. Good luck to Maidana, against mayweather." Mayweather asked boxing fans to pick between Maidana and Khan, and more voted for Khan, a result that Khan thinks is going to be ignored. --Scott Shaffer FEBRUARY 21, 2014 GLEN JOHNSON POSTS VICTORY IN RHODE ISLAND Rob Soucy@ringside Glen Johnson TKO4 Jaime Velazquez... A fight that looked to be a gross mismatch going in turned out to be a decent scrap for the first two rounds. The result, however, was exactly what was expected. Former world light heavyweight champion Glenn Johnson improved to 54-18 with a solid performance against overmatched Jaime Velazquez. The 45 year-old Johnson controlled the action with constant pressure and a work rate that overwhelmed the 42 year-old Velazquez (11-6-2). Velazquez stole the first round with his jab but both fighters looked their age. Johnson picked up the pace in the second round and started to land his trademark overhand right. By the third, Johnson was in complete control and the end was near. He hurt Velazquez early with a looping right hand and kept the pressure on with combinations. Velazquez was all but out on his feet when his corner stopped the fight. Johnson looked like a shell of himself despite the fairly easy win but said he can win another world title. "I want to fight for the light heavyweight championship of the world," said Johnson. "My preference would be an opportunity to avenge my defeat against Bernard Hopkins but I'll fight any of the champions, (Adonis) Stevenson, (Sergei) Kovalev or (Beibut) Shumenov." Toka Kahn-Clary KO2 Carlos Fulgencio... After feeling out his opponent for a round, Providence featherweight Toka Kahn-Clary turned up the heat in the second round with a vicious body attack. He dropped Carlos Fulgencio (19-13-1) three times, each time due to a left hand to the body. The fight was stopped after the third knockdown. Kahn improved to 10-0 and has top-level skills and hand speed. Fulgencio, the loser of eight in a row, was not in the same class as Kahn-Clary, who is now on the cusp of a meaningful fight as New England's top prospect. FEBRUARY 21, 2014 JERMALL CHARLO OPEN WORKOUT QUOTES Press Release: Junior middleweight Jermall Charlo is preparing to challenge Carlos Molina for the IBF title. At an open workout in Houston, here is what Charlo had to say: "I'm super excited to bring the IBF title back to Houston. It's been a long time coming for me and my twin brother Jermell. On March 8th, I'm going to give it all I got. This is like a regular fight to me. I work hard for every fight. Carlos Molina, he is just the stepping-stone and I just have to get past this obstacle. Once my team gets past this, I feel like we'll be at the top forever." FEBRUARY 21, 2014 TOKA KAHN-CLARY AUDTIONS FOR FEATHERWEIGHT CAMPAIGN TONIGHT By Rob Soucy On Friday night at Twin River Casino in Lincoln, Rhode Island, Toka Kahn-Clary (9-0, 6 KOs) willtake on trialhorse Carlos Fulgencia (19-12, 12 KOs). Almost as significant as the fight itself is the fact that Kahn-Clary is in the process of dropping down from junior lightweight (130 pounds) tofeatherweight (126). Considered one of, if not the top prospect in New England right now, Kahn-Clary weighed in at 127 on Thursdayand said he feels strong. Despite having lost his last seven fights, Fulgencia has been in the ring with some top opposition most notablyJessie Magdaleno, Patrick Hyland and ex-champion Abner Mares earlier in his career. Kahn-Clary is promoted by Top Rank and should be prepared to step up in the near future. "I have to get him on TV, this kid can fight," said Kahn-Clary's head trainer Peter Manfredo Sr. "ESPN or Shobox, he's ready!" Kahn-Clary is also tentatively scheduled to fight on March 29th at the Texas Station Casino in Las Vegas. The rumored opponent is Chazz McDowell(6-4, 1 KO).

Trey Lippe Morrison, son of the late Tommy Morrison, won his pro debut in Miami, Oklahoma. Morrison stopped Kris Renty (1-1)in the second round. Morrison himself wasknocked down himself in the first. As the video below shows, Morrison has a long way to go before rivalling the accomplishments of his father, who briefly held the WBO heavyweight title after defeating George Foreman. Trey, a former college football player who had just one amateur fight,shares his father's muscular physique and also resembles him facially. He also shares his dad's former promoter, Tony Holden. The elder Morrison recently passed away from AIDS-related complications. FEBRUARY 21, 2014 BEN DEAN'S MAILBAG SCENE: MIKEY GARCIA VS. YURIORKIS GAMBOA? By Ben Dean Ben, What's your early take on [the proposed but not scheduled fight between] Mikey Garcia vs. Yuriorkis Gamboa? Is Mikey the real deal? Has Gamboa wasted his prime? This is a very intriguing fight to me, because it will tell a story and define these two fighters at this stage of their career. I loved watching Gamboa come up on Friday Night Fights and his early jump to HBO. He sought and destroyed his opponents, taking risk for entertainment in the process.

When the sun comes down and crashes into the earth and the world is destroyed, only two men will survive the catastrophe and that is Sting and the Undertaker brother.

Batista couldnât give his matches away man, but the WWE brings him in because heâs big. He may be big brother, but charisma has passed him by man.

It is one of the most important questions about the universe and beyond. Are we alone? It doesnât matter where you stand on this topic or how you view the evidence and theories surrounding it. The fact of the matter is that this is one of the most popular topics of debate and one where nothing can be conclusively proven, but there is a great deal of evidence that when compiled paints quite the picture. In UFO INVESTIGATIONS MANUAL: UFO Investigations from 1892 to the Present Day by Nigel Watson, we have one of the best books concerning the topic to date. It is much like a text book and the approach strays away from the sensational and focuses on what we know. It traces the history of recorded sightings, where to look for UFOs (the hot spots), various theories and alternative explanations and much more. If you are interested in learning about this topic and researching it, this book is a great step forward in your journey.

There is a new Illuminati princess and that is Katy Perry. When sheâs not holding Moloch and singing about how she worships him, she is dancing on stage as Baphomet watches on. In her video for Dark Horse, she pushes the all-seeing eye continually. At one point, she covers her eye with an all seeing eye on a stick and then she continues to place one hand over her eye in the video. She is now doing the bidding of the Illuminati and the people are eating it up. Most of the uninformed dismiss the symbolism and just think that itâs art, but there is a method to this madness.
