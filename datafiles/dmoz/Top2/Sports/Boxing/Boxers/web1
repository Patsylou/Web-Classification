[ 1 ] His little brother, Alexander , is also a professional boxer [ 2 ] and his older brother, Christian, owns a furniture shop. [ 3 ] He moved to Germany with his parents and brothers at the age of 15. He became a citizen of Germany in August 2006. As a teenager, Abraham showed an interest in cycling . He became the North Bavarian and Franconian Youth Champion. However, after watching an exciting Mike Tyson fight, Arthur was inspired by Tyson's intensity and wanted to become a boxing star too. In 1999, Arthur and his brothers returned to Armenia for military service. After 2002, all the brothers had finished their military service and returned to Germany in 2003. Arthur has a girlfriend back in Armenia. They're engaged. [ 4 ] Abraham plans on opening a boxing school in Armenia following his future retirement. [ 5 ] He will also have foreign language classes for students at the boxing school, such as English and German. "If a boxer knows no foreign language, he cannot have success internationally," Abraham noted. [ 6 ] Amateur career [ edit ] Abraham boxed as an amateur in Bamberg and later in Nuremberg . He was an International Junior Welterweight German Champion in 1997 and a three time Senior Light Middleweight Armenian Champion in 2000, 2001 and 2002. His final amateur record was 81-3-6 (48 KO). In 2003, Arthur and Alexander competed alongside promoter and manager Wilfried Sauerland and his head coach Ulli Wegner . Arthur was a sparring partner for IBF and WBA Super Middleweight Champion Sven Ottke , whom was in the preparations of a title defense. Wegner was so impressed that he began to train Arthur personally. Professional career [ edit ] Middleweight [ edit ] Abraham started his professional career on August 16, 2003, being promoted by HyeFighters. Sauerland -promoted Abraham had many impressive early victories. He defeated Canadian southpaw Ian Gardner (18â1) for the vacant WBA Inter-Continental Middleweight title, Hector Velazco (former WBO Champion) and contender Nader Hamdan (36â1). In July 2005, Abraham defended his WBA Inter-Continental title against the highly regarded Britain Howard Eastman . Eastman had previously only lost to American William Joppy and former Undisputed Middleweight Champion Bernard Hopkins . IBF Middleweight Champion [ edit ] On 10 December 2005, in Leipzig , Germany , Abraham won the vacant IBF Middleweight title against Kingsley Ikeke by a 5th round knock-out. The IBF belt had previously been vacated by undisputed champion Jermain Taylor after a bout with Abraham was denied in October that year. Abraham defended his title on 5 March 2006 with a unanimous decision against Australian Shannan Taylor . Two months later, Abraham won a second title defense against Kofi Jantuah, also on points. On 23 September 2006, Abraham won a decision against undefeated contender Edison Miranda despite having his jaw broken in two places in round four. Miranda took advantage of this by fighting dirty. Miranda was deducted five points for landing repeated low blows as well as intentionally headbutting Abraham. However, even without the five points deducted, Abraham would have still won the fight (final result: 114:109, 115:109, 116:109). Abraham's jaw was operated on the night after the fight. He had 22 screws inserted into two titanium plates. After the Miranda bout, Arthur was praised for his ability to finish the fight despite his injury. Abraham defeated Canadian SĂŠbastien Demers by KO in the third round after two minutes and fifty-seven seconds. Abraham was clearly physically superior than his opponent. Arthur won his fifth title defense by defeating fellow Armenian Khoren Gevor by 11th round knockout from a powerful left hook. On 8 December 2007, Abraham defeated Wayne Elcock to make his sixth title defense by technical knockout in the 5th round. During two of his matches, Arthur Abraham was accompanied by live performances of the Scorpions and is currently accompanied by the track "Ready For The Fight" by The Young Punx . On 29 March 2008, Abraham defeated American Elvin Ayala via 12th round KO after connecting with a devastating left hook that sent his opponent crashing to the canvas face first. This was Abraham's 7th successful title defence. Abraham-Miranda II [ edit ] On 21 June 2008, the fight took place at a catchweight of 166lbs. Abraham's IBF Middleweight title was not on the line. Abraham immediately backed Miranda up with hard right jabs before backing off himself behind a high, tight guard. A Miranda right hand landed off the gloves of Abraham as he came out more measured than he had the first time around. Abraham set in to work the body but a stray shot brought a low blow warning from the referee. Miranda made the fight throughout the second round as Abraham did little in the way of punching. Thudding body shots landed on Abraham, but Miranda could get little past the gloves upstairs. A low blow landed from Miranda in the final thirty seconds that brought a brief halt to the action; Abraham calmly caught his breath before returning to his defensive posture. Abraham waved Miranda forward after another barrage of shots bounced off his gloves before landing two body shots and a hard right hand for his best work of the bout. Miranda drew a warning for holding and hitting before another right hand from Abraham buckled his knees. Abraham stepped back rather than following up, choosing to maintain a methodical game plan. The game plan was sound. In the first minute of the fourth round, a perfectly timed right hand-left hook sent Miranda to the floor. Miranda rose, clearly hurt, and this time Abraham would not fail to press the advantage. Another left hook would drop Miranda along the ropes and Miranda would again rise but his legs were clearly gone and the end was at hand. Abraham would land a final striking right hand for the round's third knockdown as the referee leapt in to halt the action before Miranda could attempt to rise again. On 8 November 2008, "King Arthur" Abraham (28â0, 22 KOs), 28, defeated RaĂşl MĂĄrquez (41â1, 29 KOs), 37, by a 6th round technical knockout , at the Bamberg 's Jako Arena, the 8th defense of his IBF Middleweight boxing title. He retained his IBF title on 14 March 2009 against Lajuan Simon, his first fight over 12 rounds since his legendary battle against Edison Miranda. The 10th and last defense of his middlweight title took place in Berlin against Turkish-German boxer Mahir Oral. Abraham won this fight by a 10th round technical knockout. Oral's coach threw in the towel after several knockdowns. Super Six [ edit ] After failing to secure a match-up with WBO and WBC Champion Kelly Pavlik or WBA Champion Felix Sturm , Arthur announced that he would change his weight class to compete at super middleweight . Abraham participated in the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament for the WBA and WBC Super Middleweight titles. Fellow participants were: WBA Champion Mikkel Kessler , WBC Champion Carl Froch , Andre Dirrell , Andre Ward and Jermain Taylor . In his first match of the tournament, Abraham faced Jermain Taylor in 17 October 2009. Arthur was previously supposed to fight Taylor for the undisputed middleweight title, but the fight fell through. Abraham defeated Taylor via a devastating knockout in the 12th round. Taylor was hospitalized with a severe concussion, suffering short term memory loss, unable to remember details of this bout. Taylor was replaced with veteran Allan Green in the tournament. After being released from the hospital, Taylor released a statement saying that he's doing just fine and wanted to congratulate Abraham on his victory and wish him well in the tournament. [ 7 ] Former Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson was in attendance and was impressed by Abraham's intensity and determination. [ 8 ] As of the end of 2009, The Ring has ranked Abraham as the 14th best boxer in the world. [ 9 ] On 5 March 2010, Abraham was ranked #8 in the world by Yahoo! Sports . [ 10 ] On 27 March 2010, Arthur lost his next fight by disqualification due to hitting Andre Dirrell after he slipped in the 11th round. At the point of the disqualification, the scores were 97â92, 98â91 and 97â92 all in favor of Dirrell. [ 11 ] However, Abraham was coming back in the last couple of rounds and could have potentially still won by knockout. Also, various observers of the fight, including former Light Heavyweight Champion Henry Maske and fellow Super Six participants Mikkel Kessler and Allan Green, felt Dirrell exaggerated his reaction after getting hit. On 27 November 2010, Abraham lost to Carl Froch in his third fight of the tournament, which was also for the vacant WBC Super Middleweight title. Abraham was dominated from start to finish, losing by a unanimous decision. The scores given by the judges were 119â109, 120â108 and 120â108, which reflected the one-sided nature of the bout. [ 12 ] Abraham qualified for the semifinals, having one win out of three fights. But first, Arthur had a pre-fight with Croatian contender Stjepan BoĹžiÄ . Abraham won by technical knockout in the second round due to an injury in BoĹžiÄ's hand. On 14 May 2011, Abraham faced undefeated American Andre Ward in the Super Six semifinals for the WBA Super Middleweight title. Abraham lost by unanimous decision. Ward went on to defeat Froch in the finals and won the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament. Comeback [ edit ] On 30 October 2011, Abraham originally announced that he intends to return to the middleweight division in 2012 [ 13 ] but later decided to remain at super middleweight. [ 14 ] In his first comeback fight on 14 January 2012, Abraham defeated Argentinian Pablo Oscar Natalio Farias via technical knockout in round five and won the vacant WBO European Super Middleweight Championship. After Abraham landed several hard combinations that put Farias down three times in the fifth round, referee Manuel Maritxalar stopped the fight. [ 15 ] On 31 March 2012, Abraham defeated former EBU Super Middleweight Champion Piotr Wilczewski by a lopsided unanimous decision to retain his WBO European title. Wilczewski was deducted a point in the seventh round and was down in the eleventh round, though it was ruled a slip. WBO Super Middleweight Champion [ edit ] On 25 August 2012, Abraham won a twelve round unanimous decision over Robert Stieglitz to capture the WBO Super Middleweight Championship in a spectacular battle which made Abraham a two-division champion. Abraham became the second Armenian and the first German to win championships in two different divisions. The judges' scores were 116-112, 116-112 and 115-113. The bout took place in O2 World Arena , Berlin , Germany . [ 16 ] Abraham was named best boxer of Germany in 2012 by BoxSport magazine. His coach Ulli Wegner was also named the best coach of the year. [ 17 ] Abraham defended his title against Mehdi Bouadla on December 15, 2012. He won via technical knockout in the eighth round. [ 18 ] A rematch with Stieglitz took place on March 23, 2013 in Stieglitz's home of Magdeburg , Sachsen-Anhalt , Germany . Abraham's eye rapidly swelled shut in the second round and he could soon no longer see. The referee waved him off at the start of the fourth round, resulting in his defeat. [ 19 ] A rubber match with Stieglitz is expected to take place on March 1, 2014, with the WBO Super Middleweight title on the line once again.

On 24 October 2009, he appeared in Cologne , Germany for an exhibition match against entertainer Oliver Pocher in a bouncy, castle-like "ring" and fought with huge, air-cushion-like boxing gloves. [ 22 ] On 9 April 2010, Abraham took to the dance show Let's Dance on RTL with partner Nina Uszkureit, but left after the first episode of the show in order to concentrate fully on his boxing career. In the movie Max Schmeling , he played a supporting role of boxer Richard Vogt , SchmelingÂ´s last opponent. Just as in real life, Ulli Wegner was in his corner. [ 23 ] On 21 September 2008, Abraham and fellow boxer Vic Darchinyan were honored by Armenian President Serge Sargsyan during a 20th anniversary celebration of the nation's independence. Both men were awarded with medals "For the great services for Armenia" of the first degree. [ 24 ] German actor and producer Til Schweiger invited Abraham to act in his film Crime Scene .

Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali in 1967 Statistics Nickname(s) The Greatest Rated at Heavyweight Height 6ft 2in (188cm) [ 1 ] Reach 80in (203cm) Born ( 1942-01-17 ) January 17, 1942 (age72) Louisville , Kentucky , USA Stance Orthodox Boxing record Total fights 61 Wins 56 Wins by KO 37 Losses 5 Draws 0 No contests 0 Medal record Men's boxing Competitor for the USA Summer Olympics Gold 1960 Rome Light heavyweight Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. ; January 17, 1942) is an American former professional boxer , generally considered among the greatest heavyweights in the sport's history. A controversial and polarizing figure during his early career, Ali is today widely regarded for not only the skills he displayed in the ring but also the values he exemplified outside of it: religious freedom, racial justice and the triumph of principle over expedience. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is one of the most recognized sports figures of the past 100 years, crowned "Sportsman of the Century" by Sports Illustrated and "Sports Personality of the Century" by the BBC . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Born Cassius Clay, at the age of 22 he won the world heavyweight championship in 1964 from Sonny Liston in a stunning upset. Shortly after that bout, Ali joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name. He subsequently converted to Sunni Islam in 1975. In 1967, three years after winning the heavyweight title, Ali refused to be conscripted into the U.S. military , citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War . The United States Government declined to recognize him as a conscientious objector, however, because Ali declared that he would fight in a war if directed to do so by Allah or his messenger (Elijah Muhammad) . He was eventually arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges and stripped of his boxing title. He did not fight again for nearly four yearsâlosing a time of peak performance in an athlete's career. Ali's appeal worked its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court , where in 1971 his conviction was overturned on a technicality. The Supreme Court held that, since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to petitioner, it was impossible to determine on which of the three grounds offered in the Justice Department's letter that board had relied. [ 6 ] Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Ali remains the only three-time lineal World Heavyweight Champion ; he won the title in 1964, 1974, and 1978. Nicknamed "The Greatest", Ali was involved in several historic boxing matches. [ 9 ] Notable among these were the first Liston fight, three with rival Joe Frazier , and one with George Foreman , where he regained titles he had been stripped of seven years earlier. Ali revolutionized the sport of boxing by sheer power and magnetism of his personality [ 10 ] At a time when most fighters let their managers do the talking, Ali thrived in â and indeed craved â the spotlight, where he was sometimes provocative, frequently outlandish and almost always entertaining. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] He controlled most press conferences and interviews, and spoke freely about issues unrelated to boxing. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He transformed the role and image of the African American athlete in America by his embrace of racial pride and his willingness to antagonize the white establishment in doing so. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] In the words of writer Joyce Carol Oates, he was one of the few athletes in any sport to completely "define the terms of his public reputation."

[ 20 ] Unlike many boxers, he was raised in a supportive, African American middle-class family. The older of two boys, he was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr. , who himself was named after the 19th century abolitionist and politician of the same name . His father painted billboards and signs, [ 20 ] and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay , was a household domestic. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist , he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius and his younger brother Rudolph "Rudy" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists . [ 21 ] He is a descendant of pre- Civil War era American slaves in the American South , and is predominantly of African-American descent, with Irish and English ancestry. [ 22 ] He was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin , [ 23 ] who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief taking his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told him he better learn how to box first. [ 24 ] For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak . [ 25 ] Clay won six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union National Title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. [ 26 ] Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Shortly after his return home from Rome following the Olympics, Ali would claim in his 1975 autobiography that he threw his medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend of his were being refused service at a "whites-only" restaurant, and fighting with a white gang. The story has since been heavily debated and several of Ali's friends from photographer Howard Bingham to Budini Brown denied it. Brown later told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, " Honkies sure bought into that one!" Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali confirmed that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali later received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta , where he lit the torch to start the games. Professional boxing Early career Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker . From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19â0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson , Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, Lamar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper . Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down both by Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a vicious left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963, was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number-two and -three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden . Jones staggered Clay the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown onto the ring (watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder). The fight was later named "Fight of the Year". In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. Jones was "an ugly little man;" Cooper was a "bum." He was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff. Madison Square Garden was "too small for me." [ 27 ] This audacious behavior, unlike that of any fighter in recent memory, made him controversial and disliked by most writers, many former champions and much of the general public. After Clay left Moore's camp in 1960, partially due to Clay's refusing to do chores such as dish-washing and sweeping, he hired Angelo Dundee , whom he had met in February 1957 during Ali's amateur career, [ 28 ] to be his trainer. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed. Heavyweight champion Main article: Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knock outs, Clay was a 7â1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him "the big ugly bear." "Liston even smells like a bear," Clay said. "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo." He declared that he would "float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," and, summarizing his strategy for avoiding Liston's assaults, said, "Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see." Clay turned the prefight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that "someone is going to die at ringside tonight." Nothing like this had ever occurred in the history of boxing. Clay's pulse rate was around 120, more than double his norm of 54. [ 29 ] Most of those in attendance, apparently including Liston, thought Clay's behavior stemmed from extreme fear; some commentators wondered if he would even show up for the bout. The outcome of the fight was one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. But Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss wildly and look awkward. At the end of the first round Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with sharp jabs to the amazement of the crowd. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye, the first time Liston had ever been cut. Clay rested in round four, but as he came to his corner at the end of the round, he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer Angelo Dundee to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves. [ 29 ] (Though not confirmed, Bert Sugar claimed that at least two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes 'burning'". [ 30 ] [ 31 ] ). Despite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston virtually at will. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by TKO. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted "eat your words!" Then, during the now-infamous in-ring interview following the match, Clay shouted, "I shook up the world!" "I talk to God every day." "I must be the greatest!" When Clay won, he became the youngest boxer (22 years old) to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion, though Floyd Patterson was the youngest to win the heavyweight championship at 21, during an elimination bout following Rocky Marciano 's retirement. Mike Tyson broke both records in 1986 when he defeated Trevor Berbick to win the heavyweight title at age 20. Clay, now having changed his name to Muhammad Ali following his conversion to Islam and affiliation with the Nation of Islam, met Liston for a rematch in May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine . Originally scheduled for Boston the previous November, it was delayed due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before. [ 32 ] Postponed six months, the fight proved to be as controversial as the first was shocking. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a punch later dubbed by the press as the "phantom punch" because no one saw it. Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner , and referee Jersey Joe Walcott did not begin the count. Liston rose after he had been down about twenty seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. But suddenly Walcott reversed himself and stopped the match, declaring Ali the winner by knockout. The entire fight lasted less than two minutes. [ 33 ] Rumors circulated almost immediately after the fight - and continue to this day - that Liston dropped to the ground purposely. Various reasons include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam , that he had bet against himself and that he "took a dive" to pay off debts. Slow motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is uncertain whether the blow was a genuine knock-out punch. Ali's second title defense was against Floyd Patterson, former heavyweight champion who had lost twice to Liston in first-round knockouts. Patterson had made what Ali considered denigrating remarks about his religion; Ali dubbed Patterson a "white man's champion" and taunted him with the name "Rabbit." At times during the fight, Ali appeared to toy with Patterson, refusing, for example, to throw a single punch in the first round and easily avoiding Patterson's lunging "kangaroo punch." Some felt Ali deliberately prolonged the fight to inflict maximum punishment. Ali won a 12-round TKO. Patterson later said that he strained his sacroiliac , a statement supported by video of the fight. The clowning and taunting of Patterson was criticized by many in the sports media. Ali and then- WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, "I got nothin against them Vietcong." Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to host the fight, citing technicalities . [ 34 ] Instead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against George Chuvalo , Henry Cooper , Brian London and Karl Mildenberger . Ali returned to the United States to fight Cleveland Williams in the Houston Astrodome . According to Sports Illustrated, the bout drew a then-indoor world record of 35,460. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but In 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and 10 feet (3.0m) of his small intestine . Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round TKO in what some consider the finest boxing exhibition of his career. Ali and Terrell finally met in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell was considered Ali's toughest opponent since Liston - unbeaten in five years and having defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced. Terrell was big, strong and had a three-inch-reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali "Clay," much to Ali's annoyance (Ali called Cassius Clay his "slave name"). The two almost came to blows over the point in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell . Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. "I want to torture him," he said. "A clean knockout is too good for him.". [ 35 ] The fight was close until the seventh round when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with sharp jabs and shouting between punches, "What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?" Ali was unable to knock out Terrell, winning a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him - forcing Terrell to fight with one eye - and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong to fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as "one of the ugliest boxing fights". Tex Maule later wrote: "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." Ali denied he intended to harm Terrell on purpose nor did he feel he was cruel to him during the bout. But for Ali's critics, the fight provided still more evidence of his arrogance. After his title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, Ali's title was stripped following his refusal to be drafted to Army service on April 28, [ 20 ] His boxing license was also immediately suspended by the state of New York; he was convicted on June 20 by an all-white jury and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for draft evasion. While his case was on appeal, he was free on posted bond and served no jail time. Exile and comeback Main articles: Fight of the Century and Ali-Frazier II Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces, stating publicly that, "no Vietcong ever called me nigger." He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970âfrom ages 25 to almost 29âas his case worked its way through the appeal process. In 1971, the US Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a unanimous 8-0 ruling ( Thurgood Marshall abstained from the case). During this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice. On August 12, 1970, with his case still in appeal in 1970, Ali was granted a license on August 12 to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission, thanks to State Senator Leroy R. Johnson. [ 36 ] Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut. A month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license. [ 37 ] He fought Oscar Bonavena at Madison Square Garden in December, a uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic TKO of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion Joe Frazier . Ali and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the " Fight of the Century ", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it "the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life." The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes. [ 38 ] Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a "dumb tool of the white establishment." "Frazier is too ugly to be champ," Ali said. "Frazier is too dumb to be champ." Ali also frequently called Frazier an Uncle Tom . Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, "Ali was saying, 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan . I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?'" [ 38 ] The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head "no" after he was hit. In the later roundsâin what was the first appearance of the "rope-a-dope strategy"âAli leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds [ 39 ] Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat. Ali's characterizations of Frazier during the lead-up to the fight cemented a personal animosity toward Ali by Frazier that lasted until Frazier's death. [ 40 ] Frazier and his camp always considered Ali's words cruel and unfair, far beyond what was necessary to sell tickets. Shortly after the bout, in the studios of ABC's Wide World of Sports during a nationally televised interview with the two boxers, Frazier rose from his chair and wrestled Ali to the floor after Ali called him ignorant. After the loss, Ali fought Quarry, a second bout with Floyd Patterson and Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, Ali suffered the second loss of his career at the hands of Ken Norton , who broke Ali's jaw during the fight. After initially seeking retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout, leading to a rematch at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974 with Joe Frazierâwho had recently lost his title to George Foreman. Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round (referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover). However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was corneredâthe latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision. Heavyweight champion (second tenure) Main articles: The Rumble in the Jungle and Thrilla in Manila The defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa , Zaire, on October 30, 1974âa bout nicknamed " The Rumble in the Jungle ". Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton âwho had given Ali four tough battles and won two of themâhad been both devastated by Foreman in second round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell , gave the former champion a chance of winning. As usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer David Frost , "if you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!" [ 41 ] He told the press, "I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick." [ 42 ] Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting "Ali, bomaye" ("Ali, kill him") wherever he went. Ali opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, beginning in the second roundâand to the consternation of his cornerâAli retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punchingâall while verbally taunting Foreman ("is that all you got, George? They told me you could hit."). The move, which would later become known as the " Rope-A-Dope ," so violated conventional boxing wisdomâletting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at willâthat at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. [ 43 ] Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and didn't land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Jimmy Carter greets Mohammed Ali at a White House dinner, 1977 In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said, "I'll admit it. Muhammad outthought me and outfought me." [ 38 ] Ali's next opponents included Chuck Wepner , Ron Lyle , and Joe Bugner . Wepner, a journeyman known as "The Bayonne Bleeder," stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot. Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila . The bout, titled " The Thrilla in Manila ", was held on October 1, 1975 [ 20 ] in temperatures approaching 100Â°F (38Â°C). In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the 'rope-a-dope" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the twelfth round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called "target practice" on Frazier's head. Still, at the end of the 14th round, Frazier was still standing and Ali appeared exhausted. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent. An ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight "was the closest thing to dying that I know" and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, "why would I want to go back and see Hell?" After the fight he cited Frazier as "the greatest fighter of all times next to me." Decline WBAL-TV 's Curt Anderson , 1978, Baltimore , Maryland. Following the Manila bout, Ali fought Jean-Pierre Coopman , Jimmy Young , and Richard Dunn , winning the last by knockout. Later in 1976, Ali participated in an exhibition bout in Tokyo against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist Antonio Inoki . [ 44 ] Though the fight was a publicity stunt, Ali suffered leg bruises, two blood clots and an infection in his legs due to Inoki's kicks. [ 44 ] The fight was ultimately declared a draw. [ 44 ] Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time at Yankee Stadium in September 1976, where Ali won by a heavily contested decision, which was loudly booed by the audience. Ali reacted to the fallout of this by announcing a brief retirement to practice his faith in Islam, having converted to Sunni Islam after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year. [ 45 ] After winning against Alfredo Evangelista in May 1977, Ali struggled in his next fight against Earnie Shavers that September, who pummeled Ali a few times with punches to the head. Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused Ali's longtime doctor Ferdie Pacheco to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, "the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough. [ 46 ] " In February 1978, Ali faced Leon Spinks at the Superdome in New Orleans . At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by unanimous decision. A rematch followed shortly thereafter in New Orleans, which broke attendance records. Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight, making him the first heavyweight champion to win the belt three times. Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face Larry Holmes for the WBA belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, "Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror." It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands. [ 47 ] The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the Mayo Clinic , who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali's return to the ring. [ 48 ] The fight took place on October 2, 1980 in Las Vegas with Holmes easily dominating Ali, who was weakened from thyroid medication he had taken to lose weight. Giachetti called the fight "awful... the worst sports event I ever had to cover." Actor Sylvester Stallone at ringside said it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive. [ 46 ] Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee finally stopped the fight in the eleventh round, the only fight Ali lost by knockout. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali's Parkinson's syndrome . [ 49 ] Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981 in Nassau against Trevor Berbick , losing a ten-round decision. Later years Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome in 1984, a disease that is common to head trauma from activities such as boxing. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Ali still remained active during this time, however, later participating as a guest referee in the inaugural WrestleMania event. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Reagan "punching" Muhammad Ali in the oval office, 1983 Around 1987, the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution selected Ali to personify the vitality of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights . Ali rode on a float at the following year's Tournament of Roses Parade , launching the U.S. Constitution's 200th birthday commemoration. He published an oral history , Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times by Thomas Hauser, in 1991. That same year Ali traveled to Iraq during the Gulf War and met with Saddam Hussein in an attempt to negotiate the release of American hostages. [ 55 ] In 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , Georgia. Ali's bout with Parkinson's led to a gradual decline in Ali's health though he was still active into the early years of the millennium, even promoting his own biopic, Ali , in 2001. Ali also contributed an on-camera segment to the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. On November 17, 2002, Muhammad Ali went to Afghanistan as the " U.N. Messenger of Peace ". [ 56 ] He was in Kabul for a three-day goodwill mission as a special guest of the UN. [ 57 ] On September 1, 2009, Ali visited Ennis , County Clare , Ireland , the home of his great-grandfather, Abe Grady, who emigrated to the U.S. in the 1860s, eventually settling in Kentucky. [ 58 ] A crowd of 10,000 turned out for a civic reception, where Ali was made the first Honorary Freeman of Ennis. [ 59 ] On July 27, 2012, Ali was a titular bearer of the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He was helped to his feet by his wife Lonnie to stand before the flag due to his Parkinson's rendering him unable to carry it into the stadium. [ 60 ] On February 3, 2013, in a Washington Times article, Ali's brother, Rahman Ali , said Muhammad can no longer speak and could be dead within days. [ 61 ] Ali's daughter, May May Ali, responded to rumors of her father being near death, stating that she had talked to him on the phone the morning of February 3 and he was fine. [ 62 ] Personal life Marriages and children Ali has been married four times and has seven daughters and two sons. Ali met his first wife, cocktail waitress Sonji Roi, approximately one month before they married on August 14, 1964. [ 63 ] Roi's objections to certain Muslim customs in regard to dress for women contributed to the breakup of their marriage. They divorced on January 10, 1966. On August 17, 1967, Ali married Belinda Boyd. After the wedding, she, like Ali, converted to Islam and more recently to Sufism , [ 64 ] changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: Maryum (b. 1968), twins Jamillah and Rasheda (b. 1970), and Muhammad Ali, Jr. (b. 1972). [ 65 ] Maryum has a career as an author and rapper. [ 66 ] In 1975, Ali began an affair with Veronica Porsche , an actress and model. By the summer of 1977, Ali's second marriage was over and he had married Veronica. [ 67 ] At the time of their marriage, they had a baby girl, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, Laila , was born in December 1977. By 1986, Ali and Veronica were divorced. Laila later became a boxer in 1999, [ 68 ] despite her father's earlier comments against female boxing in 1978: "Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that... the body's not made to be punched right here [patting his chest]. Get hit in the breast... hard ... and all that." [ 69 ] As of 2014, Laila is undefeated in the super middleweight category, with 24 wins, no losses, and no draws. [ 70 ] On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda ("Lonnie") Williams. They had been friends since 1964 in Louisville. They have one son, Asaad Amin, whom they adopted when Amin was five months old. [ 65 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Ali was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the early 1970s. [ 75 ] Ali has two other daughters, Miya and Khaliah, from extramarital relationships. [ 65 ] [ 76 ] Ali currently lives in Scottsdale , Arizona with Lonnie. In January 2007 it was reported that they had put their home in Berrien Springs , Michigan, up for sale and had purchased a home in eastern Jefferson County , Kentucky for $1,875,000. [ 77 ] Lonnie converted to Islam from Catholicism in her late 20's. [ 78 ] The Nation of Islam and religious beliefs Elijah Muhammad Ali said that he first heard of the Nation of Islam when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, and attended his first NOI meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although keeping his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met Malcolm X, who soon became his spiritual and political mentor, and by the time of the first Liston fight NOI members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in The Miami Herald just before fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation, which nearly caused the bout to be cancelled. In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam (often called the Black Muslims at the time) due to his boxing career. [ 79 ] However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to recruit him as a member. [ 79 ] Shortly afterwards, Elijah Muhammad recorded a statement that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (fourth rightly guided caliph ). Only a few journalists (most notably Howard Cosell ) accepted the new name at that time. Ali later announced that "Cassius Clay is my slave name". [ 80 ] Ali's friendship with Malcolm X soon ended as Malcolm split with the NOI a couple of weeks after Ali joined, and Ali remained with the Nation. [ 79 ] [ 81 ] Ali later said that turning his back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes he regretted most in his life. [ 82 ] Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader Elijah Muhammad and a pseudo-history that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The NOI was widely viewed by whites and even some African Americans as a black separatist "hate religion" with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak NOI doctrine. [ 18 ] For example, in a press conference articulating his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ali stated, "my enemy is the white people, not the Vietcong". [ 18 ] In relation to integration, he said: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all." [ 83 ] And in relation to inter-racial marriage: "No intelligent black man or black woman in his or her right black mind wants white boys and white girls coming to their homes to marry their black sons and daughters." [ 83 ] Indeed, Ali's religious beliefs at the time included the notion that the white man was "the devil" and that white people were not "righteous." Writer Jerry Izenberg once noted that, "the Nation became Ali's family and Elijah Muhammad became his father. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career." [ 38 ] Ali converted from the Nation of Islam sect to mainstream Sunni Islam in 1975. In a 2004 autobiography, written with daughter Hana Yasmeen Ali, Muhammad Ali attributes his conversion to the shift toward Islam made by Warith Deen Muhammad after he gained control of the Nation of Islam upon the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975. Later in 2005 he embraced spiritual practices of Sufism . [ 84 ] Vietnam War and resistance to the draft In 1964, Ali failed the U.S. Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub-par (he was quoted as saying, "I said I was the greatest, not the smartest!"). [ 85 ] However, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified as 1A . [ 20 ] This classification meant he was now eligible for the draft and induction into the U.S. Army during a time when the United States was involved in the Vietnam War . When notified of this status, Ali declared that he would refuse to serve in the United States Army and publicly considered himself a conscientious objector . [ 20 ] Ali stated: "War is against the teachings of the Holy Qur'an . I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers." More succinctly and famously he said, "I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong...," words that articulated for a generation of young Americans a reason to oppose the war. [ 86 ] Appearing for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces on April 28, 1967 in Houston, Ali refused three times to step forward at the call of his name. An officer warned him he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called. As a result, he was arrested. On the same day the New York State Athletic Commission suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. Ali would not be able to obtain a license to box in any state for over three years. [ 87 ] At the trial on June 20, 1967, after only 21minutes of deliberation, the jury found Ali guilty. [ 20 ] After a Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the years between the appellate court decision and the Supreme Court verdict, Ali remained free. As public opinion began turning against the war and the Civil Rights movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country, rare if not unprecedented for a boxer. At Howard University , for example, he gave his popular "Black Is Best" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor Nathan Hare on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court in Clay v. United States overturned Ali's conviction by a unanimous 8-0 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate). [ 90 ] The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the Appeal Board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the Appeals Board relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed. [ 91 ] Impact of Ali's stance Ali's example inspired countless black Americans and others. New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote that, "Aliâs actions changed my standard of what constituted an athleteâs greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?" [ 8 ] Recalling Ali's anti-war position, Kareem Abdul Jabbar said: "I remember the teachers at my high school didn't like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a Black man and that he had so much talent . . . . made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him." [ 92 ] Ali inspired Martin Luther King, Jr. , who had been reluctant to address the Vietnam War for fear of alienating the Johnson Administration and its support of the civil rights agenda. Now, King began to voice his own opposition to the war for the first time. [ 93 ] In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, "one thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years." [ 94 ] (See comment below In the media and popular culture about the new The Trials of Muhammad Ali film documentary which explores this Vietnam draft issue.) NSA monitoring of Ali's communications In a secret operation code-named "Minaret," the National Security Agency (NSA) monitored the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker , Dr. Martin Luther King , prominent U.S. journalists, who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam. [ 95 ] A review by NSA of the NSA's Minaret program concluded that Minaret was "disreputable if not outright illegal." [ 95 ] Quotes about Vietnam war â Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong. [ 96 ] â? â No, I am not going 10,000miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slavemasters over dark people the world over. This is the day and age when such evil injustice must come to an end. [ 97 ] â? â Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights? [ 98 ] â? â My enemy is the white people, not the Vietcong . . . . You're my opposer when I want freedom. You're my opposer when I want justice. You're my opposer when I want equality. You won't even stand up for me in America because of my religious beliefs, and you want me to go somewhere and fight, when you won't even stand up for my religious beliefs at home. [ 18 ] â? Boxing style boxing gloves are preserved in the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History Ali had a highly unorthodox boxing style for a heavyweight, epitomized by his catchphrase "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Never an overpowering puncher, Ali relied early in his career on his superior hand speed, superb reflexes and constant movement, dancing and circling opponents for most of the fight, holding his hands low and lashing out with a quick, cutting left jab that he threw from a number of angles. His footwork was so strong that it was extremely difficult for opponents to cut down the ring and corner Ali against the ropes. One of Ali's greatest tricks was to make opponents over commit by pulling straight backward from punches. Disciplined, world-class boxers chased Ali and threw themselves off balance attempting to hit him because he seemed to be an open target, only missing and leaving themselves exposed to Ali's counter punches, usually a chopping right. [ 99 ] Slow motion replays show that this was precisely the way Sonny Liston was hit and apparently knocked out by Ali in their second fight. [ 100 ] Ali often flaunted his movement and dancing with the "Ali Shuffle," a sort of center ring jig. [ 101 ] Ali's early style was so unusual that he was initially discounted because he reminded boxing writers of a lightweight, and it was assumed he would be vulnerable to big hitters like Sonny Liston. Ali probably had the fastest hand and foot speed ever seen in a big fighter. Using a synchronizer, Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, measured young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight, often considered the best pound-for-pound fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45â50 pounds heavier. [ 102 ] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was until they got in the ring with him," Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. "Ali would rub you out," said Floyd Patterson. "He would hit you 14,000 times and he wouldn't knock you out, he rubbed you out." Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But in a little while I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me. He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late." [ 103 ] Commenting on fighting Ali in his prime, George Chuvalo said: "He was just so damn fast. When he was young, he moved his legs and hands at the same time. He threw his punches when he was in motion. He'd be out of punching range, and as he moved into range he'd already begun to throw the punch. So if you waited until he got into range to punch back, he beat you every time." [ 46 ] Floyd Patterson said, "It's very hard to hit a moving target, and (Ali) moved all the time, with such grace, three minutes of every round for fifteen rounds. He never stopped. It was extraordinary." [ 46 ] Darrell Foster, who trained Will Smith for the movie Ali, said: "Ali's signature punches were the left jab and the overhand right. But there were at least six different ways Ali used to jab. One was a jab that Ali called the 'snake lick,' like cobra striking that comes from the floor almost, really low down. Then there was Ali's rapid-fire jab - three to five jabs in succession rapidly fired at his opponents' eyes to create a blur in his face so he wouldn't be able to see the right hand coming behind it." [ 104 ] In the opinion of many, Ali became a different fighter after the three and one-half year layoff. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's corner physician, noted that he had lost his ability to move and dance as before. [ 38 ] This forced Ali to become more stationary and exchange punches more frequently, exposing him to more punishment while indirectly revealing his tremendous ability to take a punch. This physical change led in part to the "rope-a-dope" strategy, where Ali would lie back on the ropes, cover up to protect himself and conserve energy, and tempt opponents to punch themselves out. Ali often taunted opponents in the process and lashed back with sudden, unexpected combinations. The strategy was dramatically successful in the George Foreman fight, but less so in the first Joe Frazier bout when it was introduced. Of his later career, Arthur Mercante said: "Ali knew all the tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching. Not only did he use it to rest, but he was big and strong and knew how to lean on opponents and push and shove and pull to tire them out. Ali was so smart. Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali had a sense of everything that was happening, almost as though he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it." [ 46 ] "Talking trash" Ali regularly taunted and baited his opponentsâincluding Liston, Frazier and Foremanâbefore the fight and often during the bout itself. Ali's pre-fight theatrics were almost always highly entertaining, although his words were sometimes cutting and unfair, and were largely designed to promote the fight. But his antics were often based on an unerring sense of a particular psychological trigger or vulnerability in his opponent that would provoke a reaction and cause the opponent to lose focus. Frazier was "too dumb to be champion." He would whip Liston "like his Daddy did." Terrell was an "Uncle Tom." Patterson was a "rabbit." Ali was a master of provocation, and he had a clear understanding that what one did to an opponent outside the ring could be even more crucial than what one did to him in the ring. [ 105 ] In speaking of how Ali stoked Liston's anger and overconfidence before their first fight, one writer commented that "the most brilliant fight strategy in boxing history was devised by a teenager who had graduated 376 in a class of 391." [ 106 ] Ali typically portrayed himself as the "people's champion" and his opponent as a tool of the (white) establishment (despite the fact that his entourage often had more white faces than his opponents). During the early part of Ali's career, he built a reputation for predicting rounds in which he would finish opponents, often vowing to crawl across the ring or to leave the country if he lost the bout. [ 20 ] Ali admitted he adopted the latter practice from "Gorgeous" George Wagner , a popular professional wrestling champion in the Los Angeles area who drew thousands of fans to his matches as "the man you love to hate,". [ 20 ] ESPN columnist Ralph Wiley called Ali "The King of Trash Talk." [ 107 ] The Guardian recently lamented the decline of the "golden age of trash talking" in boxing which, it said, was exemplified by Muhammad Ali. [ 108 ] The Bleacher Report called Clay's description of Sonny Liston "smelling like a bear" and his vow to "donate him to a zoo" after he beat him the greatest trash talk line in sports history. [ 109 ] Legacy George W. Bush embraces Muhammad Ali after presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005, during ceremonies at the White House . Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named "Fighter of the Year" by Ring Magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more Ring Magazine "Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He is an inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and holds wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He is one of only three boxers to be named " Sportsman of the Year " by Sports Illustrated . In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the Board of Aldermen in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky , voted 6â5 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 street signs were stolen . Earlier that year, a committee of the Jefferson County Public Schools considered renaming Central High School in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. At any rate, in time, Muhammad Ali Boulevardâand Ali himselfâcame to be well accepted in his hometown. [ 110 ] In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Ali was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or alive athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. [ 111 ] He was the recipient of the 1997 Arthur Ashe Courage Award . Two years later, in 1999, the BBC produced a special version of its annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ceremony, and Ali was voted their Sports Personality of the Century, [ 112 ] receiving more votes than the other four contenders combined. On September 13, 1999, Ali was named "Kentucky Athlete of the Century" by the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in ceremonies at the Galt House East . [ 113 ] On January 8, 2005, Muhammad Ali was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George W. Bush . Later that November, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] and the " Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold " of the UN Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin for his work with the US civil rights movement and the United Nations (December 17, 2005). Muhammad Ali Center , alongside Interstate 64 on Louisville 's riverfront On November 19, 2005 (Ali's 19th wedding anniversary ), the $60million non-profit Muhammad Ali Center opened in downtown Louisville . In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility , respect, and personal growth . A youth club in Ali's hometown and a species of rose ( Rosa ali ) have been named after him. On June 5, 2007, he received an honorary doctorate of humanities at Princeton University 's 260th graduation ceremony . [ 116 ] He also received an honorary citizenship of Bangladesh in February 1978. [ 117 ] Ranking in heavyweight history Ali is generally considered to be one of the greatest heavyweights of all time by boxing commentators and historians. Ring Magazine , a prominent boxing magazine, named him number 1 in a 1998 ranking of greatest heavyweights from all eras. [ 118 ] Ali was named the second greatest fighter in boxing history by ESPN.com behind only welterweight and middleweight great Sugar Ray Robinson . [ 119 ] In December 2007, ESPN listed Ali second in its choice of the greatest heavyweights of all time, behind Joe Louis . [ 120 ] The Associated Press voted Ali the No. 1 heavyweight of the 20th century in 1999. [ 121 ] In the media and popular culture John Stango Main article: Muhammad Ali in media and popular culture As a world champion boxer and social activist, Ali has been the subject of numerous books, films and other creative works. In 1963, he released an album of spoken word on Columbia Records titled I am the Greatest! He has appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on 37 different occasions, second only to Michael Jordan . [ 122 ] He appeared in the documentary film Black Rodeo (1972) riding both a horse and a bull. His autobiography The Greatest: My Own Story , written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975. [ 123 ] In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called The Greatest , in which Ali played himself and Ernest Borgnine played Angelo Dundee . When We Were Kings , a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won an Academy Award , [ 124 ] and the 2001 biopic Ali garnered an Oscar nomination for Will Smith 's portrayal of the lead role. [ 125 ] The latter film was directed by Michael Mann , with mixed reviews, the positives given to Smith's portrayal of Ali. Prior to making the film, Smith rejected the role until Ali requested that he accept it. Smith said the first thing Ali told him was: "Man you're almost pretty enough to play me." [ 126 ] Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of Requiem for a Heavyweight , and during his exile, he starred in the short-lived Broadway musical, Buck White (1969). The film Freedom Road , made in 1978, features Muhammad Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, an ex-slave in 1870's Virginia who gets elected to the U.S. Senate in Washington D.C. and battles other former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives. On the set of Freedom Road Ali met Canadian singer-songwriter Michel, and subsequently helped create Michel's album entitled The First Flight of the Gizzelda Dragon . In 1979, Ali guest-starred as himself in an episode of the NBC sitcom Diffrent Strokes . For contributions to the entertainment industry, Ali was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard . [ 127 ] Ali recorded the song " Stand by Me " in 1964. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] The Muhammad Ali Effect is a term used in psychology that was named after him when he stated, "I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest" in his autobiography The Greatest: My Own Story . [ 123 ] According to this effect, when people are asked to rate their intelligence and moral behavior in comparison to others, people will rate themselves as more moral, but not more intelligent than others.

[ 1 ] On February 6, 1996, he fought on the first installment of HBO Boxing 's spin-off series "HBO Boxing After Dark." In one of the fights of the year, Barrera stopped Kennedy McKinney in 12 rounds, knocking him down five times whilst suffering one knockdown himself. After the McKinney fight, he defeated former WBO champion Jesse Benavides by third round knockout. On July 14, 1996, he defeated another former champion, Orlando Fernandez , by seventh round TKO. Defeat to Junior Jones [ edit ] On November 22, 1996, he suffered his first career loss and lost his title to American boxer Junior Jones , by a disqualification in round five. Barrera was knocked down in Round 5 by Jones, and was declared the loser by disqualification and not by knockout because Barrera's cornerman climbed onto the ring to stop the fight as Jones was finishing Barrera. On April 18, 1997, he was given a chance to regain his title, facing Jones in a rematch in Las Vegas . Barrera was defeated by a unanimous decision that pro-Barrera boxing fans thought was controversial, but retired from boxing nonetheless regardless of the opinions of his die-hard fans. Comeback trail [ edit ] Barrera announced a comeback in 1998 (a year later, and he started off by defeating Angel Rosario by a knockout in round five. After two more wins, he was given another opportunity to fight for a world title by the WBO. On October 31, he became a two-time world Super Bantamweight Champion by defeating Richie Wenton by a knockout in three rounds, winning the WBO's vacant title. In 1999, he had two title defenses and then he ran into controversy. On December 18, he defeated CĂŠsar Najera in four rounds at California. But upon finding out that Najera had a losing record and was part of Barrera's team, the California State Athletic Commission decided to rule the fight a no contest bout. Barrera vs. Morales I [ edit ] Main article: Barrera vs. Morales trilogy In February 2000, Barrera was defeated by the WBC Super Bantamweight title holder Erik Morales by a controversial 12 round split decision. It was an intense battle in which both fighters were cut and battered. Ring Magazine named it the fight of the year . After the bout, the WBO reinstated Barrera as their champion and he defended the title three additional times. On June 17, 2000, he defeated Luiz Freitas (19â0) by first round knockout. In his next bout, he defeated JosĂŠ Luis Valbuena (18â1) by twelve round unanimous decision. [ 2 ] On December 1, 2000, he scored a sixth round knockout over former world champion JesĂşs Salud . Featherweight [ edit ] Barrera vs. Hamed [ edit ] In 2001, Barrera moved up in weight division. On April 7, he handed British boxer Naseem Hamed his first and only loss for the Lineal Featherweight Championship by a twelve-round decision. Before the fight, Hamed was a 3 to 1 betting favorite in Las Vegas. [ 3 ] Hamed could not hit Barrera with his trademark lefts as Barrera circled to his left and worked both head and body. Barrera was not a fan of Hamed's antics and responded to Hamed's punches during clinches. On one occasion early in the fight, Hamed grabbed Barrera and they both fell to the ground where Barrera threw a right jab, leading to a warning from referee Joe Cortez. In the 12th and final round Barrera trapped Hamed in a full nelson and forced his head into the turnbuckle, resulting in a point deducted by referee Joe Cortez. Ultimately, Barrera threw more, harder punches and more impressive combinations than Hamed throughout the course of the fight. Barrera was awarded the victory via a unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 115â112, 115â112, 116â111 and won the Lineal and IBO Featherweight titles. [ 4 ] On September 8, 2001, he defeated former champion Enrique SĂĄnchez by sixth round TKO. [ 5 ] Barrera vs. Morales II [ edit ] On June 22, 2002, Barrera defeated Morales in a rematch via a unanimous decision, successfully defending his Lineal title and winning the vacant Ring Magazine title but declined Morales' the WBC belt. On November 2, he defeated former five-time world champion Johnny Tapia by a 12-round unanimous decision. [ 6 ] Barrera then competed in his 60th career fight on 12 April 2003, defeating former WBC title holder Kevin Kelley by knockout in round four. [ 7 ] Barrera vs. Pacquiao I [ edit ] On November 16, 2003, Barrera was defeated by Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao in the eleventh round when Barerra's corner threw in the towel, earning Pacquiao his third world championship in third weight division (Barrera was the recognized Lineal champion and his Ring Magazine title was also on the line when he fought Pacquiao). Prior to the bout, it was revealed that Barrera had undergone surgery to repair a cluster of malformed blood vessels in his head. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Barrera's training was also interrupted when the " Old Fire " wildfire of 2003 forced his team to evacuate their training facilities located in Big Bear Lake, California and leaving him and his coaches without some of the training equipment he needed (following the evacuation). [ 10 ] [ 11 ] On June 19, 2004, Barrera defeated former WBA Bantamweight title holder Paulie Ayala in Los Angeles by a tenth round knockout. Super-featherweight [ edit ] Barrera vs. Morales III [ edit ] On November 27, 2004, Barrera fought Morales for the third time and became a three-division world champion by defeating Morales in a majority decision to capture the WBC Super Featherweight title. [ 12 ] On April 9, 2005, Barrera retained the title with a second round knockout against future champion Mzonke Fana in El Paso, Texas, this win also marked Barrera's 60th career win. [ 13 ] On September 17 of the same year, he unified his WBC Super Featherweight title with the IBF title by defeating the IBF title holder Robbie Peden by a twelve round unanimous decision in Las Vegas. [ 14 ] Barrera vs. JuĂĄrez [ edit ] On May 20, 2006, Barrera defended his title against American boxer Rocky JuĂĄrez with what was announced immediately after the fight as a twelve-round draw, which the judges scored 115â113, 113â115 and 114â114. However, tabulation errors were found in the judges' scorecards, leading to a final score of 115â114, 114â115 and 115â114, a split decision in favor of Barerra. He fought JuĂĄrez in a rematch bout on September 16, this time Barrera won by a unanimous decision with scores of (117â111, 115â113, 115â113). [ 15 ] Barrera vs. MĂĄrquez [ edit ] On March 17, 2007 Barrera lost his WBC Super Featherweight title to fellow Mexican boxer Juan Manuel MĂĄrquez by unanimous decision. Barrera claimed that the judges and referee were wrong, because he knocked down MĂĄrquez in the seventh round and the referee ruled it a slip. [ 16 ] Barrera vs. Pacquiao II [ edit ] Barrera fought Pacquiao in a rematch bout for the WBC International Super Featherweight title on October 6, 2007 in Las Vegas. Barrera was defeated by a unanimous decision with scores of 118â109, 118â109, 115â112. After the match, Barrera expressed his desire to retire from boxing, however no official confirmation had been given. On February 13, 2008, Barrera announced to the media that he would fight the winner of the MĂĄrquez vs. Pacquiao bout on March 15. The winner of this turned out to be Pacquiao, in a highly disputed split decision. [ 17 ] However, Pacquiao's move to the lightweight division and subsequent capture of the WBC Lightweight title ensured that a third fight between the two would not happen. Lightweight [ edit ] Marco Antonio Barrera, at 35, ended his brief retirement and signed a five-year contract on August 26, 2008 with promoter Don King. [ 18 ] He moved up to the lightweight division, his goal to become the first Mexican ever to win a title in 4 different weight divisions. [ 19 ] On November 7, 2008, Barrera marked his return to the ring, in Chengdu , China , by knocking out Sammy Ventura in his first bout in the lightweight division. [ 20 ] Barrera vs. Khan [ edit ] It was announced on January 15, 2009 that Barrera would return to the ring against British boxer Amir Khan . Even with Barrera getting on in years, this was seen to be the biggest test of the young Briton's career thus far. Frank Warren promoted the fight, which took place on March 14, 2009 at the MEN Arena . Barrera lost the bout by a fifth-round technical decision. In the first round, the two fighters clashed heads, resulting in a deep gash above Barrera's forehead, which bled throughout the bout. Ringside doctors stopped the fight at the beginning of the fifth round due to the severity of the cut. The judges scored the fight 50â45, 50â45 and 50â44 for Khan at the point of stoppage and he was declared the winner by technical decision. However there was some controversy over the time of the stoppage, as Barrera had sustained the cut during the first round and that it would be constantly examined before the referee officially stopped the fight in the fifth round. [ 21 ] On March 26, 2009 as a result of the controversial stoppage timing, Barrera's promoter, Don King , filed a protest with the British Boxing Board of Control, WBA and WBO on behalf of Barrera, claiming the accidental clash of heads should have resulted in the fight being ruled a no-contest. [ 22 ] Under the rules governing the bout, had the fight been stopped prior to the end of the fourth round due to the accidental headbutt, the official ruling would have been no contest, requiring an immediate rematch. Referee Dave Parris, however, waited until midway through the fourth round before asking the ringside physician to inspect the wound. Before this fight, Barrera had fought Freudis Rojas on January 31, 2009 in Zapopan, Jalisco . Rojas was disqualified for a headbutt which left Barrera with a bad cut over his left eye. The cut could have jeopardized Barrera's scheduled bout against Khan. [ 23 ] Despite this injury, he recovered in time for his bout with Khan and the fight went ahead regardless. Comeback [ edit ] After the loss, Barrera took a period of inactivity. The former three time world champion fought on June 26, 2010 against Adailton de Jesus of Brazil. The 10 round bout took place at the Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas, United States. [ 24 ] The match was an undercard of the Latin Fury 15 PPV, which featured Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. vs. John Duddy . Marco Antonio Barrera dominated De Jesus for 10 rounds, winning via decision. On February 12, 2011, he fought Jose Arias of the Dominican Republic and scored a TKO in the second round.

Contents 1 Amateur career 2 Professional career 2.1 Commonwealth Champion 2.2 World Title Challenge 2.3 Road Back to World Title Contention 3 Championships 4 Professional boxing record 5 Personal life 6 References 7 External links Amateur career [ edit ] Fighting out of Liverpool 's Rotunda ABC, Bellew claimed the both the 2002 and 2003 novice ABA title's by knocking out every man he faced with the exception of Rob Hough who went the whole 3 rounds from Paramount ABC (Stockport) in the under 10 bouts championships. Then, when he was eligible for the Senior championships, he stepped up to the 91kg heavyweight class and added even more titles to his collection. In 2006 he lost to Danny Price . The 27-year-old, a three-time ABA heavyweight champion, is hoping to emulate the feats of his home city's most famous fighter, John Conteh. Like Bellew, Conteh was an ABA champ, before winning British, Commonwealth, European and WBC titles at 175 pounds. And Conteh has even backed Bellew to match his achievements, revealing that he will be keeping a close eye on his career. "John is a big hero of mine, one of the best fighters to have come out of the UK, if not the best, and I'd love to go on and achieve what he did," said Bellew. "To be talked about in the same breath as him is pretty amazing. I've met him a few times and he's a great guy, although I'm not sure he knew who I was! Once I start winning titles, hopefully that will all change." Bellew, who fought out of the world famous Rotunda ABC as an amateur, did not start boxing until he was 17. Of 47 amateur fights, he won 40, 32 inside the distance, and earned the nickname "The Bomber" because of his punching power. And he is hoping that power will transfer to the professional ranks. "It's going to be tough getting down to light-heavyweight having always fought as a heavyweight, but it's even worse news for my opponents," said Bellew. "There will be a few guys with a high ranking who are going to get knocked out. "The light-heavyweight division in the UK is not as talented as others, so I can definitely make an impact. Bellew, trained by former WBU middleweight champion Anthony Farnell, isn't all about brawn though - he trained as an accountant while an amateur, although he now plans to put his career in finance on hold. "I'm not your average boxer," he said. "I've already got plans for where I'm going to invest my money, and my financial background will come in handy when it comes to making investment decisions. "I want to provide a good future for my sons Corey and Cobey, and as you don't earn money for overtime in this sport the plan at the moment is to get in and out of the ring as quickly as possible to maximise my earning potential." Amateur Record: 40â7. Professional career [ edit ] Bellew made his professional boxing debut on 6 October 2007 against journeyman Jamie Ambler and made a winning start with a second round win. He followed up the victory with further wins in 2007 over Adam Wilcox, fighting at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and Wayne Brooks at the Bolton Arena . [ 2 ] In 2008 Bellew defeated Paul Bonson, Ayitey Powers, Hastings Rasani, Jevgenijs Andrejevs and Phil Goodwin to take his record up to 8â0. During 2009 he advanced to an unbeaten 12â0 with further wins against the likes of Matthew Ellis, Nick Okoth, Jindrich Velecky and Martial Bella Oleme. [ 2 ] Commonwealth Champion [ edit ] On 12 March 2010 Bellew challenged for the vacant Commonwealth title at light heavyweight beating Atoli Moore at the Echo Arena in Liverpool . [ 3 ] He made his first defence of the title on 24 September 2010 winning a hard fought victory against Bob Ajisafe at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London's Mayfair with Bellew having to recover from a flash knockdown during the fight. [ 1 ] He made his second defence of the title on 9 December 2010, returning to the Echo Arena to stop former Commonwealth champion Ovill McKenzie in the 8th round despite suffering two knockdowns himself in the fight in both the 1st and 2nd rounds. [ 4 ] On 18 May 2011 it was announced that Bellew would challenge Nathan Cleverly for the WBO light heavyweight title following a pullout from Cleverly's scheduled opponent JĂźrgen BrĂ¤hmer with the fight due to be held only three days later on the 21 May 2011. Bellew however, failed to make the weight and was replaced with Polish boxer Aleksy Kuziemski . [ 5 ] On 16 July 2011 Bellew made the third defence of his Commonwealth title and also won the vacant British belt with a repeat victory over Ovill McKenzie , with the bout this time lasting the full 12 rounds. [ 2 ] World Title Challenge [ edit ] It was announced that Bellew would fight Nathan Cleverly in Liverpool , on 15 October 2011, for the WBO light heavyweight title. For the first two rounds, the fight started at a ferocious pace, with Bellew rocking Cleverly in the second round. As the fight carried on, Cleverly's boxing skills came through to wear down the resistance of Tony Bellew. Cleverly won the fight via majority decision. One judge scored the bout at 114â114 whereas the other two judges scored the bout at 117â112 and 116â113. Road Back to World Title Contention [ edit ] After losing to Nathan Cleverly Bellew took on Danny McIntosh for the vacant British Light Heavyweight Title knocking McIntosh out in the 5th Round. Next he took on former World title challenger Edison Miranda for the WBC International belt. He stopped Miranda in the 9th Round. On 17 November 2012 he beat highly rated Argentine Roberto Bolonti for the WBC silver title. Bellew was cut badly but went the full 12 rounds to a win unanimous decision, taking him one step further to a second world title fight. On 30 March 2013, he fought Malawian boxer Isaac Chilemba in a title eliminator. Bellew started very well, but Chilemba raised his game in the later rounds. Although many felt Bellew had done enough to secure a points decision, the judges scored it a controversial draw. Chilemba granted a rematch which Bellew won on points. Bellew was made Mandatory Challenger for the WBC Light Heavyweight Title following the win against Chilemba. However a fight between Adonis Stevenson and Tavoris Cloud occurred on 28 September 2013 with the winner being made to defend his title against Bellew before the end of the year. Stevenson won the fight after Cloud retired after 7 rounds. Bellew subsequently lost to Stevenson via 6th round TKO on 30 November 2013 at the ColisĂŠe Pepsi , Quebec City . After this, he announced his intention to fight at cruiserweight .

Fighting under the name James J. Braddock (ostensibly to follow the pattern set by two prior world boxing champions, James J. Corbett and James J. Jeffries ), he was known for his powerful right hand, solid chin and comeback from a floundering career. He had lost several bouts due to chronic hand injuries and was forced to work on the docks and collect social assistance to feed his family during the Great Depression . In 1935 he fought Max Baer for the Heavyweight title and won. For this unlikely feat he was given the nickname "Cinderella Man" by Damon Runyon . Braddock was managed by Joe Gould . Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 2.1 Baer vs. Braddock 2.2 Heavyweight Champion 3 Personal life 4 Death and legacy 5 Professional boxing record 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links Early life [ edit ] Braddock was born in Hell's Kitchen in New York City on West 48th Street, within a couple of blocks of the Madison Square Garden venue, where he later became famous. He was the son of Irish-American parents Elizabeth (nĂŠe O'Tool) and Joseph Braddock. [ 1 ] He stated his life's early ambition was to play football for Knute Rockne at the University of Notre Dame , but he had "more brawn than brains." Career [ edit ] This section does not cite any references or sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (June 2013) Braddock pursued boxing, turning pro at the age of 21, fighting as a light heavyweight. After three years, Braddock's record was 44-2-2 with 21 knockouts. [ citation needed ] In 1928, he pulled off a major upset by knocking out highly regarded Tuffy Griffiths . The following year he earned a chance to fight for the title, but he narrowly lost to Tommy Loughran in a 15-round decision. Braddock was greatly depressed by the loss and badly fractured his right hand in several places in the process. His career suffered as a result, as did his disposition. [ citation needed ] His record for the next 33 fights fell to 11-20-2. With his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Braddock had to give up boxing for a little while and worked as a longshoreman . Due to frequent injuries to his right hand, Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his longshoreman work, and it gradually became stronger than his right. He always remembered the humiliation of having to accept government relief money, but was inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement , a Christian social justice organization founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry. After his boxing comeback, Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various Catholic Worker Houses, including feeding homeless guests with his family. [ citation needed ] Baer vs. Braddock [ edit ] In 1934, Braddock was given a fight with the highly touted John "Corn" Griffin . Although Braddock was intended simply as a stepping stone in Griffin's career, he knocked out the "Ozark Cyclone" in the third round. Braddock then fought John Henry Lewis , a future light heavyweight champion. He won in one of the most important fights of his career. After defeating another highly regarded heavyweight contender, Art Lasky , whose nose he broke during the bout on March 22, 1935, Braddock was given a title fight against the World Heavyweight Champion, Max Baer . [ citation needed ] Baer hardly trained for the bout. Braddock, on the other hand, was training hard. "I'm training for a fight. Not a boxing contest or a clownin' contest or a dance," he said. "Whether it goes 1 round or 3 rounds or 10 rounds, it will be a fight and a fight all the way. When you've been through what I've had to face in the last two years, a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet. He might come at me with a cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I've had to face." [ citation needed ] Considered little more than a journeyman fighter, Braddock was hand-picked by Baer's handlers because he was seen as an easy payday for the champion. Instead, on June 13, 1935, at Madison Square Garden Bowl , Braddock won the Heavyweight Championship of the World as the 10-to-1 underdog in one of the most stunning upsets in boxing history. [ citation needed ] During the fight, a dogged Braddock took a few heavy hits from the powerful younger champion (30 years vs 26 years for Baer), but Braddock kept coming, wearing down Baer, who seemed perplexed by Braddock's ability to take a punch. In the end, the judges gave Braddock the title with a unanimous decision. [ citation needed ] Heavyweight Champion [ edit ] James Braddock suffered from problems with his arthritic hands after injuries throughout his career, and in 1936, his title defense in Madison Square Garden against the German Max Schmeling was canceled under suspicious circumstances. Braddock argued he would have received only a US$ 25,000 purse against Schmeling, compared to $250,000 against rising star Joe Louis . [ citation needed ] Louis was considered to be the more dangerous opponent and the fact that he, being a black man, could be heavyweight champion made many boxing insiders against his getting a title shot. Braddock agreed to the fight with the stipulation that he would receive 10% of promoter Mike Jacobs' future fights. So if Braddock beat Louis or Louis retired, the deal was for any fight and any boxer that Jacobs was handling for the next ten years. This money did not include the purse, just money from the concessions i.e. hotdogs, drinks, tee shirts programs etc. So win or lose Joe Gould got Braddock a great deal. Braddock was able to knock down Louis in the fight, and Louis went on to win. Louis was quoted as saying that Braddock was the bravest man he ever fought. [ citation needed ] Personal life [ edit ] Braddock married Mae Fox in 1930 and the couple had three children, James (Jay), Howard and Rosemarie. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 and became a 1st Lieutenant. Upon return, he worked as a marine equipment surplus supplier and helped construct the Verrazano Bridge in the early 1960s. [ 2 ] Death and legacy [ edit ] North Bergen, New Jersey . On his death in 1974 at the age of 69, James J. Braddock was interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Tenafly, New Jersey . He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2001. James J. Braddock North Hudson County Park in North Bergen, New Jersey is named in his honor. [ 3 ] The 2005 biographical film Cinderella Man tells the story of James J. Braddock. Directed by Ron Howard , and starring Russell Crowe as Braddock and RenĂŠe Zellweger as his wife, Mae. [ 4 ] The film had an estimated budget of $88 million and grossed $108.5 million worldwide. [ 5 ] Crowe's performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor . Paul Giamatti , playing Braddock's manager Joe Gould, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . The role of neighbor Sara Wilson was played by Rosemarie DeWitt , who is Braddock's real-life granddaughter (daughter of Braddock's daughter Rosemarie Braddock and husband Kenny DeWitt). The film received mostly positive reviews. [ 6 ] One notable scene from the movie depicts Braddock returning with interest the welfare money he begrudgingly received from the federal government. Braddock's posterity affirms this event was true.
