Join Our Busy Boxing Message Board Today Where the boxing fans have a voice Boxing Talk | Ask the Trainer | Off Topic | MMA Boxing News UK Weekend Roundup By Jane Warburton February 24th, 2014 All Boxing Results Driffieldâs Curtis Woodhouse ended his boxing career on a high note Saturday night when he won the BBBofC British Light-Welterweight Title by split decision over the Champion - Darren Hamilton of Bristol.

Challenger Charlo Calls IBF Champ Molina A Stepping Stone By Boxing Press February 24th, 2014 All Press Releases Houston based light middleweight Jermall Charlo spoke with the media this weekend about his IBF title opportunity against reigning champion Carlos Molina on March 8 as part of the Canelo Avlarez vs. Alfredo Angulo fight card at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Jermall Charlo, Top Light Middleweight Contender: "I'm super excited to bring the IBF title back to Houston. It's been a long time coming for me and my twin brother Jermell.

Troubling Signs On Bradley vs. Pacquiao 2 Undercard By Jose Espinoza February 22nd, 2014 All Boxing Articles The rematch between Timothy Bradley and Manny Pacquiao is a bout most observers believe will have the same result as the first encounter. By that, I mean that Pacquiao will win the fight. In fact, had it not been for a controversial decision by the judges that gave Bradley the victory the first time around, this second encounter would never take place. In any event, the rematch is the only forgiving aspect of boxing where a fighterâs past sins are forgiven. Pacquiao, (55 wins, 5 losses with 38 Knockouts), must demonstrate that he is still a dominant fighter and leave any decision out of the judgeâs handâ as for Bradley, (31 wins, 0 losses with 12 knockouts), he must prove that his victory was not a fluke and that he is a legitimate world champion fighter. As the fighters are trying to have their past forgiven, the undercard put forth by Top Rank promotions to showcase the main event is unforgivable. When the news hit that Top Rank chairman Bob Arum revealed the undercard for the Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley bout on April 12, 2014, the web was abuzz with disbelief at the lack of formidable fighters that would be showcased prior to the main event. Most observers believed that Brandon Rios (31 wins,2 losses with 23 knockouts) or Ruslan Provodnikov (23 wins, 2 losses with 16 knockouts) would be on the undercard. Instead, we have Khabib Allakhverdiev (19 wins, 0 losses with 9 knockouts) facing off against Jessie Vargas (23 wins, 0 losses and 9 knockouts) for the Junior Welterweight title and add to that Roman Martinez (27 wins, 2 losses with 16 knockouts) taking on Raymundo Beltran (28 wins, 6 losses with 2 knockouts) in a lightweight bout. If you are asking yourselves who these fighters are, youâre not alone. Some might be aware of Jessie Vargas but really Top Rank isnât helping promote the fighter with this opponent. Which leaves me to ask if this undercard reflect worse on Pacquiao or Top Rank? More...

He hangs back and relies on reflexes and instinct to get the job done. He has been working with the very underrated Virgil Hunter, however, and his game is improving. Teddy Atlas touches on this during the last part of this video as Mayfield does a subtle dip to his left and catches Serrano coming in with a picture perfect right hand. Filed in Boxing Prospects | | Comments (0) Alexis Arguello vs. Edwin Rosario Friday, February 25, 2011 I love âfire versus iceâ? matchups in boxing and an Arguello versus Rosario fight would have epitomized that description. Using the simulation TITLE BOUT, Iâm placing Arguello in his lightweight prime which occurred around 1980-81. I believe Rosario hit his lightweight (and career peak) in 1986 when he nearly decapitated reigning title holders Hector â? Camacho and Livingstone âPit Bullâ? Bramble. Alexis Arguello...Cool as ice. Arguello and Rosario should have fought in 1983. Rosario was an up and coming lightweight by 1982 and emerged as the top contender for the throne held by Arguello. Arguello, however, elected to move up in weight and attempt to become boxingâs first four division champion by fighting Aaron Pryor. Had Arguello remained in the division, he and Rosario would have no doubt made for a classic battle. Rosario would have had an eleven year age advantage but Arguello would obviously have the experience on his side. Rosario could start fires with his left hook. I would favor Arguello by the slimmest of margins in this fantasy fight. I canât see Rosario taking him out early although Arguello was certainly vulnerable in the early rounds (Jose Luis Ramirez/Andy Ganigan). Rosario starts fast but can be outmuscled. He suffered beatdowns from Ramirez and Julio Cesar Chavez but never tasted the canvas so his toughness is underrated. I think a bout between the two would go to a decision with Arguello by a point or two. Using strategies I believe they would employ if they had met, here is the result as simulated by TITLE BOUT. ROUND ONE ROUND TWO ROUND THREE ROUND FOUR ROUND FIVE ROUND SIX ROUND SEVEN ROUND EIGHT ROUND NINE ROUND TEN ROUND ELEVEN ROUND TWELVE All three judges score in favor of Arguello 117-111, 115-112, and 116-111.

There is only a six year age difference between the two but it must be said that Tyson was at a higher place in the food chain when Tua came around. Tyson was at his peak around â87-89 during his 21st-23rd years. Tua, on the other hand, hit his peak around â96-97 at around 24-25 years of age. Theoretically, this would have been a viable matchup from âIn hindsight, however, Tyson was clearly at the tail end of his skills and whatever management team he employed during that time simply steered clear of the dangerous Tua. Add in the fact that Tyson was fighting for Showtime and Tua was showcased on HBO, there was never serious talk. But with a little promotion, this could have easily been a fight the public would have bought hook, line and sinker as it has barn burner written all over it. So, my dream match here would have taken place around 1996. Tyson had just regained the WBC heavyweight crown from Frank Bruno with a third round stoppage. Meanwhile, Tua is an up and comer with knockout wins over John Ruiz and Darroll Wilson while being hyped heavily by HBO. My personal belief is that Tua would have knocked out Tyson if they had met during this time. Tua never had the tenacity or aggression Tyson possessed. But I believe his left hook was just as lethal as Tysonâs. Tyson had advantages in speed, killer instinct and experience. Tua will have an advantage in mental toughness and an arguable advantage in physical strength. I believe that the power of will Tua showed in his fight against Ike Ibeabuchi would have been enough to overcome the now mentally unstable Tyson. Neither man has ever fought anybody of a similar style. Their only common opponent is Lennox Lewis. Lewis stopped Tyson in eight rounds in 2002. Tua dropped a decision to Lewis in 2000.

Hard hitting, focused and strong as all hell, one cannot help but wonder when a great boxer will emerge from the Samoan islands. Samoa has had its share of boxers but with the exception of David Tua there hasnât been anyone who has achieved worldwide renown. Hardcore fans will point out that the Polynesian islands have produced Fossie Schmidt, Karama Leota, Maselino Masoe, Samson Pouha, Jimmy Thunder, and recently Bowie Tupou but again, not really a murdererâs row. My personal favorite was Pisa Finai who made a few appearances on ESPN in the early 1980s. He was the epitome of the crude brawler who swung for the fences with every shot. Considering the Samoan gene pool has produced many football players so one can extrapolate that same pool can produce a great fighter. Problem is that boxing Samoans face disadvantages as the culture does not really have that sport in its history. To excel, a Samoan fighter must leave the native soil and get the advanced training available in countries like Australia and New Zealand. Enter Vaitele Soi, a 5â? cruiserweight who turned pro in 2008 and has amassed a record of 13-0 with 10 knockouts. He has feasted on the slim pickings in the Oceania boxing scene (one of his opponents had a record of 1-14) but he has dispatched the rest in acceptable fashion. His goal is to sign with Top Rank which has David Tua and the recently signed Leti Leti to its roster. Initially, Vaitele was discouraged by his family from going into the sport. âWhen his father was still alive told him to take up another sport,â? Vaiteleâs mother Sulufaiga said. âHe was vehemently against boxing citing itâs not right for Vaitele to be beaten by another person thatâs not family. He brought him into the world and is responsible for him.â? His mother, however, saw how serious Vaitele was when he left school to pursue the sport. âFor me I saw that Vaitele was totally committed to boxing so I convinced his father that perhaps boxing is his calling and weâre just prolonging the inevitability.â? Soi comes from a supportive family which prays and watches out for him as he ascends the boxing ladder. âWhen he goes out we all make sure we talk to him to be careful, donât drink too much because you never know that there are people out there who are jealous, or some just want to challenge him because of who he is and those kinds of things,â? his mother said. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1EQtn1r-ZE Soi may have a problem in that he has been inactive for the past eight months. Here is hoping he signs with Top Rank and is spared years of toiling in the Australian/New Zealand circuit.

Johan Perez looks to be the heir apparent to Edwin Valero as the next power punching Venezuelan to hit the world scene. You can see here that he has some pop and has good height for a junior welterweight. His weakness as far as I can see is that he sometimes keeps his chin in the air when he throws a power shot a la Naseem Hamed. Currently he is 11-0 with 8 knockouts. Iâm adding him to the list of prospects to be monitored. You can check out a clip of his knockout of Azael Cosio here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOIHlIdcBVc Filed in Boxing Prospects | | Comments (0) A star is born Monday, February 21, 2011 This Saturday was a coming out party for Nonito Donaire (is it pronounced doe-nair or do-nai-ray?). Either/or, you can call him a star on the rise. Donaire simply annihilated a formidable champion in Fernando Montiel . Montiel, who never seems to win the big one, was never in this fight. He looked a full weight division smaller than the âFilipino Flashâ? and was steamrolled by Donaireâs evil left hook in the second round. As Montiel was sprawled out on the canvas, it was apparent that the punch had short circuited his brain so badly that he seemed to continue to throw punches while laying on his back. Referee Russell Mora seemed to be at a loss as to what to do when Montiel arose (more on instinct than anything else). He instructed Montiel to come forward and received no response from the dazed Mexican. The fight should have been stopped here. But then Mora took the bull by the horn, wiped off Montielâs gloves himself, and then waved Donaire on to complete the execution. Mora then quickly jumped in to stop the bout when Donaire landed two additional blows and seeing the error in his allowing the bout to continue. Donaire was never mentioned in pound for pound rankings until Saturday nightâs coming out party. All of a sudden, the team of Jim Lampley, Max Kellerman, and Roy Jones were effusive in their praise of their newly designated ânumber twoâ? best fighter in the world. Jones was astute enough to point out that, indeed, he was ranking Donaire number two only because âFloyd Mayweather was inactive.â? Nonetheless, the âFilipino Flashâ? delivered an electrifying knockout of a solid champion so I understand the HBO hyperbole. Donaireâs breakout performance rivals that of Donald Curryâs annihilation of Milton McCrory in 1985 or even Thomas Hearnsâ destruction of Pipino Cuevas in 1980. You got the feeling you were watching someone special hit their stride with the possibility of greatness. The only question really is how far up in weight class can Donaire go. The bantamweights are a sturdy bunch but no one is a threat to the power punching Filipino. The junior featherweight division is a wasteland of unknowns playing musical chairs with the belts. The featherweight division, however, would be an ideal spot for Donaire. Juan Manuel Lopez, Chris John, Yuriorkis Gamboa would all be delicious matchups for boxingâs fastest rising star. I believe Donaire would be best served leapfrogging up to the featherweights and continue to rise up as far as he could goâŚ Donaire has a lankier build than Pacquiao and quickly dismissed Kellermanâs question of him ever facing the Pacman in the ring with a âno, no, of course not.â? But if he keeps piling up these type of electrifying victories and he continues to rise in weight the answer may change from âof course notâ? to âwhy not?â? Filed in Boxing Opinion | | Comments (0) Ill poke your bloody eye out, mate! Friday, February 11, 2011 This is one for the WTF? Category if I had one. Turns out the father of heavyweight prospect Tyson Fury, Mr. â? John Fury is going to jail. His crime? It seems that Mr. Fury fought himself in a fight with one Oathie Sykes at a car auction. He shoved his finger in Sykesâ right eye and gouged it out. Moments before he did this, â? John Fury declared himself to be the âtoughest man in the country.â? Now that is a bad ass move. Turns out the elder Fury was a heavyweight prospect himself at one point in his life and earned an 8-4 record over a professional career that lasted from 1987-1991 (with a brief comeback bid in 1995.) The closest he came to making headlines was against Henry Akinwande in 1991 and Fury was stopped in the third. The following is an excerpt from the Manchester Evening News, describing the court testimony. Â  Choking back tears, Fury of Moss Lane, Wilmslow begged the judge for mercy after admitting wounding Mr Sykes with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. âm worried about my son,â? he said. âHis boxing career is on the line.â? Speaking of the victim, he added: âIf I could give my own eye to him to get back to my children I would do â Iâm begging you for my life.â? Mr Sykes told court that he believed Fury wanted to completely blind him in the attack on the morning of July 14 last year. âIt was like he was trying to pull his finger into my brains through my socket,â? he said. âI was screaming, Please stop, youâre hurting me. âAfter that he tried to take my other eye â he tried to blind me, sir, not once he tried to blind me, twice.â? Mr Sykes told the court he had gone to British Car Auctions at Belle Vue to buy his 17-year-old son Buddy his first van when John Fury approached him with his âchest upâ. The two men had been pals but had a violent bust-up over a bottle of beer during trip to Cyprus in 1999. When they met at auction Mr Sykes claimed Fury asked him: âWhat about me and you finishing that fight?â? The victim claimed that he said âI donât want no troubleâ and Mr Fury replied: âm the best man here in the auction, Iâm the best man in the country.â? Â  Mr Sykes added: âHe meant that he could beat any man at the auction, heâs the best man at fighting.â? The pair traded punches, lurching between cars, before Fury grabbed Mr Sykes by his shoulder-length hair and gripped him in a headlock. âHe was pushing his hand in my face,â? said Mr Sykes. âIt was his finger, it went in my eye, in the corner and he wouldnât stop, he was like gouging and poking and twisting and poking, all of a sudden I heard this sound, a clicking like, a popping noise and when he took his hand away I realised blood was in his hand, a lot of blood.â? The attack, which Mr Sykes said he âthought would never endâ was witnessed by scores of car-buyers. Mr Sykesâ teenage sons Buddy, and 13-year-old Jesse, saw the âawful aftermathâ after going to the cafe to get a drink. Fury was arrested a month later and admitted the offence, saying he was âa man of honourâ who was willing to accept responsibility. But he denied that he had meant to deliberately blind the victim in what had merely been a âhard contestâ. He claimed that the victim had bitten him on the cheek, and had been accidentally injured when he pulled his face away. This meant the two men had to give evidence in court before Judge Michael Henshell. Fury said the brawl had started out as a fair âfight between travelling peopleâ before Mr Sykes family waded in, leaving him âfrightened for my lifeâ. âIf I was going to do what he said I done to him it would have been a lot worse than that,â? he said. âm a not a feather-duster man.â? Fury said that Mr Sykes had targeted him to make a name for himself knowing that he was âout of shapeâ. But Mr Sykes denied it had been a â â an organised fight between two grudging parties â and told the judge âwhat John Fury did was wrongâ. His son Buddy, himself an amateur boxer, said his father suffered a âsavage beatingâ, and his 13-year-old brother, Jesse, also gave evidence in his dadâs favour. Judge Henshell ruled against Furyâs account of how the victim was injury as âentirely unconvincingâ. Defending the father-of-six, Michael Levy said while fighting was a âway of lifeâ in Furyâs community, he was not a violent man, but someone dedicated to his family and the career of his extremely accomplished son, who plans a world title challenege. Sentencing, Judge Henshell said Fury had been â in inflicting the âcatastrophic injuryâ. A spokesman for the CPS said: This was a sustained and unprovoked assault that led to a man losing an eye. âThe fact the root of this dispute which originated more than 12 years ago was so trivial only serves to highlight the senseless nature of the attack. Â The elder Fury should have gone into MMA in the early daysâŚ Filed in Boxing Opinion | | Comments (0) Canadian Invasion? Friday, February 11, 2011 When most modern boxing historians think of Canadian boxers they usually name George Chuvalo first and if theyâre really historically astute theyâll cite Sam Langford as the greatest. Being that I came of age as a boxing fan in the 1980s, I usually think of the Fighting Hilton brothers. I think of Matthew Hilton in particular as he had a bigger fan base than his brothers and certainly accomplished more. I recall his bout with Buster Drayton in Montreal and the crowd just rocked. Canadians are admirably serious about their boxing heroes and are great fans. Furthermore,Â  there has been a recent influx of talent (Jean Pascal, Lucian Bute) so they are starting to get some recognition on the world scene. This Friday, two Canadian contenders will be featured on ESPNâs Friday Night Fights as they go to the always raucous Bell Centre in Montreal to give us bouts involving Antonin Decarie and Ionut Ion. Decarie has a 24-1 record with 7 knockouts. His one loss was against the ancient Souleymane Mbaye of France in which he lost a bid for the vacant WBA interim junior welterweight belt. Decarie was dropped in the fourth and going by the judgesâ scorecards managed to win only three rounds. Three years ago there was talk of him taking on a comebacking Arturo Gatti for the Canadian belt until Gatti met his demise in Brazil. This past October, Decarie appeared lucky to get past Puerto Ricoâs Irving Garcia. All of this despite Decarie being on the receiving end of high tech training which supposedly âtrains the brainâ? http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1601635/virtual_tools_help_athletes_train_their_brain_for_faster_reaction/) for faster reaction times. I say give me roadwork, sparring, and an old school trainer. Decarie looks like the second coming of Stephane Oulette. Which means heâll make some money fighting nobodies on the Canadian circuit but will fail spectacularly when faced with the slightest uptick in competition. Ionut Ion (aka Jo Jo Dan) is another Romanian transplant (Bute, Adrian Diaconu) making his way as a pro in Canada. Like Decarie, he is a powder puff puncher and sports a 27-1 record with 15 knockouts. His one loss was via split decision to Seycuk Aydin. The bout took place in Aydinâs native Turkey and according to Internet reports Ion was robbed. Nonetheless, he is a light hitting southpaw in a division (welterweight) that seems to be getting more stacked by the day.Â  Tomorrow night, Ion takes on the prehistoric Steve Forbes and should win an easy decision. Doesnât take a genius, however, to figure out he wonât become a force in the division. Going to take a pass on ESPNâs Friday Night Fights tomorrow.

Broner will be making his HBO debutÂ againstÂ the always dangerous Ponce De Leon.Â  DeLeon is a former junior featherweight champion stepping up to lightweight. Broner, on the other hand, has fought as high as junior welterweight. This will be a showcase match for Broner. Broner fights under the banner of Golden Boy Promotions. He started as a six year old under the tutelage of his father and embarked on a stellar amateur career of over 300 bouts. He has a twin brother who also boxed under the moniker âThe Solution.â? Â âThe Problemâ? will have a problem overcoming the lure of the streets of Cincinnati, however. There is a growing list of Cincinnati champions and contenders who fell victim to the cityâs dark side in various ways; Aaron Pryor, Tommy Ayers, Tim Austin, and Ricardo Williams. Evidently, Broner missed a shot at the last Olympics for undisclosed reasons. Â Judging by the footage I found of him on Youtube, Bronerâs style is nothing likeÂ any of hisÂ Cincinnati predecessors. As some of the commenters have noted, it is easy to see the Floyd Mayweather comparisons. He uses the Detroit style of Mayweather and James Toney;Â  the same stance and employs the same shoulder roll defense. He often mimicsÂ Mayweathers regularÂ use of the left jab to the body.

Posted on February 22, 2014 by consortium11 2 More than one person has been made a fool of trying to predict Floyd Mayweather Jrs next move. Not so very long ago after all, it was seemingly guaranteed that Mayweathers next opponent would be Amir Khan . The announcement never happened and next came a fan poll on who it would be. The results of this were somewhat confusing; on most boxing sites the answer was Marcos Maidana but on the official poll Khan (helped by a lot of twitter advertsing) had a late surge to take the lead. And of course, there had been rumours and âexclusive reportsâ? long before that. Â  But now it looks somewhat definitive . Khan himself says that hes out of the running and that Maidana is the one about to earn millions of dollars and the chance, however remote, to enter his name in boxings history as the man who defeated Mayweather. Ive been pretty dismissive of the Khan bout previously but despite that I can see why it was an attractive option. Khan has many flaws but what he undoubtedly has is speed. Khan would be the fastest opponent Mayweather has faced since at least Judah and arguably the fastest hes ever faced. Much of Mayweathers success has been built on being the faster man, pot-shotting and picking off opponents from the outside; could he do the same against someone quicker than him? Maidana in contrast, despite technical improvements shown in his recent run that culminated in his d efeat of the heavily hyped ânew Floyd Mayweatherâ? Adrien Broner , is still very much a brawler, an aggressive and powerful puncher who likes to draw boxers into a fight. Weve seen Floyd against those repeatedly and he tends to win and win well. Outside the ring Khan also seemingly offers a lot. Floyd likes to tap into other fanbases its one of the reasons he boxes many fighters with Latino heritage, especially around Mexican Independence Day as it opens up that lucrative market. Khan may not bring them, but he does bring the UK fans and the UK has frequently proven itself as a solid money maker for boxers. Maidana in contrast may be a popular TV fighter but he has no real constituency to fall back on; fans of Maidana tend to be boxing fans as opposed to fans of individual boxers and thus would have probably watched anyway. So how is it that Khan didnt get the bout when he had so much in his favour?

Mayweather and those around him pretty much introduced the term Olympic style testing into the boxing jargon during the messy negotiations between him and Manny Pacquiao for their much delayed and still uncertain superfight. Some associated with Mayweather accused Pacquiao of abusing P.E.Ds, Mayweather demanded more stringent testing than the athletic commissions require and for whatever reason (and it wasnt entirely clear what it was) Pacquiao turned it down. The entire thing was somewhat of a farce and none of the parties come out of it smelling of roses. But as well as accusing others of P.E.D abuse, there have been a number of rumours about Mayweather and his own conduct. Thomas Hauser, one of the few journalists to really put any effort into looking at P.E.D abuse in boxing, has written about the whispers that Mayweather Jr himself failed three tests that were hushed up. But thats not the rumour I want to focus on. The one I wish to focus on has been around for a while, at least since Mayweather faced Castillo for the first time. In the build up to that bout the commentators mention how Mayweather had suffered from hand issues and had injected himself to deal with them. From there the rumour has grown, passed on through message boards and badly sourced articles to reach a current form that essentially goes like this: Floyd Mayweather injects his hands with a dubious substance during training and for bouts. This substance is banned in most states and the reason Mayweather only boxes in Nevada is that it is the only state to allow it/he has a special deal with them which means he ignores it. Mayweather is thus is essence a drug cheat . Lets see if theres any truth to this rumour Continue reading Posted in Analysis , Boxing | Tagged Floyd Mayweather Jr , Lidocaine , PEDS , Xylocaine | 1 Reply Pacquiao vs Bradley 2signed. Posted on January 26, 2014 by consortium11 Reply So, its on again. Having signed a contract extension that keeps him with Top Rank (and thus likely ruled himself out of having a bout with Mayweather for the forseeable future) Timothy Bradley and Manny Pacquiao will meet up once more . To say the result of the first bout was controversial would be an understatement. Im one of the few who considered the eventual result (a narrow split decision for Bradley) to be correct although Id have been happy with any score between the eventual 115-113 Bradley to 116-112 Pacquiao. The bout was close with a number of close rounds and I think in the hyperbole about the decision that was often forgotten; neither Bradley nor Pacquiao was spectacular. Both men come into this contest with something to prove. Bradley wants to prove the first contest was neither a fluke nor a robbery and that he is Pacquiaos better. Pacquiao wants to prove hes back to his best after some underwhelming performances and his chilling knockout loss to Marquez. In the pairs last bouts they each took a step towards that, Bradley asserting himself as one of the best welterweights in the world with a crafty but comfortable decision win over Marquez while Pacquiao showed he wasnt shot by u tterly outclassing the hapless Brandon Rios . So what points should we consider going into this rematch?

(because *gesticulating to imaginary opponents* he can get it and he can get it apparently). He was first Mr HBO and then Mr Showtime. He was the next big thing, the new star to carry boxing forward, the apple of Golden Boys eye. He was the heir to Mayweather, the next love-to-hate superstar for whom the only thing that matched his arrogance and conceit was his talent and skill. Adrien Broner has long been used to people mocking him but they were â? jealous of his success not fans taking a sadistic glee in his failure . Adrien Broner has long been used to âgoing viralâ but those were his own ill-advised entries on social media not Photoshops of him broken and beaten . Adrien Broner has long been used to being the headline but that was him making them, not him being made into one. But what Adrien Broner isnt used to is losing. Before his bout with Marcos Maidana, Broner was jokingly asking whether Maidana really want to box him or if instead Maidana had simply wanted to meet him in person . After the bout Broner was fleeing the ring as soon as the decision was announced, being pelted with rubbish by the fans in attendance to a chorus of boos . Early in the bout with Marcos Maidana, Broner had slipped behind Maidana and mockingly humped him .
