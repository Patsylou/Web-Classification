The Vancouver Police Basketball Team has been actively involved in the community since the 1950s. We currently participate in dozens of events annually, encompassing as many members of the community as possible. Additionally, we provide support to local teams, leagues and tournaments through the donation of basketballs, uniforms, t-shirts and other equipment. VPD Basketball on CTV's Perry's Prospects Vancouver Police officers from the VPD Basketball Society played teams of students from numerous Vancouver schools in an annual Christmas event at the Roundhouse Community Centre. Approximately 80 students from Grades 2 to 7 took part and enjoyed lunch and a visit from Santa. Competitive Teams VPD Basketball has traditionally fielded competitive basketball teams, both men's and women's. These teams have playyed in competitive leagues locally, World Police Fire Games, and tournaments around Canada and North America. Community Games Throughout the year, the VPD is invited to and attends dozens of games throughout Vancouver and its neighbouring communities. These games range from high school all-star games, Aboriginal tournaments, youth tournaments, and Night Hoops programs. School Games As part of the VPD's Police Athletic League (PAL), basketball players annually participate in fun games at local elementary schools. Additionally, the VPD hosts an annual high school tournament for Vancouver schools.
