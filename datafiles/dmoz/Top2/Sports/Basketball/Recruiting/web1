The more we know about your players, the more we can share that information with the college coaches and the recruiters. Being recruited is much more than just going to a Showcase and playing games in front of the college coaches. Just because you pay your money and attend a showcase, does not mean that your players will play at the next level. Getting recruited by the right school requires more than just scoring points.
