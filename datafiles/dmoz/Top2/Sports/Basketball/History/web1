Catch Free Spirits on the ESPN flagship network this coming Tuesday, October 8 at 8PM ET . Free Spirits tells the story of the Spirits of St. Louis - from the emergence and antics of all-star Marvin Barnes, to their rookie radio play-by-play announcer Bob Costas, the team's incredible 1975 playoff upset of the defending champion New York Nets, and the unbelievable financial deal that the Spirits' owners made at the time of the ABA/NBA merger in June 1976 (otherwise known as the Best Deal in Sports). Eight-time Emmy winner Dan Forer produced and directed the feature. He scoured the archives for Spirits video footage, photos, and period interviews, many of which have never been seen before. If you miss the premiere of Free Spirits on October 8, the feature will be available for download on iTunes on October 9, will be released on Blu-Ray/DVD later this year, and will be replayed on various ESPN channels in the future. If you can identify any of the pro basketball players and coaches pictured above and to the left (click on them to see if you're right), then you remember the red, white and blue league: the defunct American Basketball Association. The ABA existed from 1967 to 1976 -- for nine full seasons. During that time, the ABA fought a bitter war with the established National Basketball Association (the NBA) for players, fans, and media attention. In June 1976, the two rival pro leagues finally made peace. Four of the strongest ABA teams (the New York Nets , Denver Nuggets , Indiana Pacers , and San Antonio Spurs ) joined the NBA and survived. The other remaining ABA teams (the Kentucky Colonels , the Spirits of St. Louis , and the Virginia Squires ) vanished, along with the ABA itself. However, the ABA is still vividly remembered by its loyal fans. The ABA was the league with the psychedelic red, white and blue basketball, outlandish promotions , and huge afros . It was the league that adopted the three-point shot -- the exciting home run of basketball -- as its own. The ABA was the league that successfully brought (or returned) modern professional basketball to hoops-crazy cities like Indianapolis , San Antonio , Dallas , Salt Lake City , Charlotte/Greensboro , Louisville , Norfolk , and Denver . ABA franchises succeeded and even thrived in these locations. The ABA was also the league without any business sense. The ABA placed unstable franchises in cities like Pittsburgh , Memphis , Miami , San Diego , Washington, D.C. , Minneapolis , Houston , Baltimore and Anaheim . For various reasons, these teams struggled to survive. Eventually they disappeared or relocated, leaving their few fans with some strange and indelible memories. During the course of its existence, the ABA featured dazzling above-the-rim players like Julius (Dr. J) Erving , Connie Hawkins , George () Gervin , David Thompson , George McGinnis , Artis Gilmore , Moses Malone , Roger Brown and Dan (the ) Issel . Each of these electric stars first played professional basketball in the ABA -- with young legs and few limitations. The frontier spirit of the ABA also led to a group of memorable characters. The ABA had a coach named and players named and And, who could ever forget Marvin Bad News Barnes , Mr. Excitement Wendell Ladner , Warren Jabali , and Babe Magnolia Mouth McCarthy ? But all of these brilliant ABA artists went on stage in front of notoriously small crowds. Most ABA teams had serious attendance problems and almost no national or local television coverage. As a result, the colorful history of the ABA is almost entirely word-of-mouth. The purpose of this web site is to preserve this history, and provide a much needed space for ABA fans to share their favorite memories. This web page is actually a work--all of the photos, uniforms, and memories on this page have been contributed by various ABA fans across the country.

It's purely a mental exercise powered by endless possibilities, debates and sometimes the most ridiculous of projections. The earliest mock draft relic I unearthed was from 1982. What was once sporadic is now commonplace. Anybody and their momma who has a website can not only provide you with a mock, but now give it to you two years in advance. This led me to an interesting question: What players were projected as first rounders in a mock, but went undrafted? And so the historical study ensured. Clearly I'm looking for a player's worst moment, when the dream was so close to reality, yet crashed and burned. How cruel of me to re-hash demise? I can assure you there's no malice in this. My intent is to simply illustrate the absurd and often overrated nature of Mock Drafts. The 90's decade gave it to us the worst. Let's check this out... 1990 Scott Williams Position: Center Mock Draft Consensus: Mid-Late First Despite being a 3-year starter for the University of North Carolina, one of the nationâs premier basketball programs, Williams was passed over on draft night. He was tagged a first round NBA draft pick by many analysts due to his size, productivity and high level of coaching, but disappointing senior year, compounded by a nagging shoulder issue forced Williams draft stock entirely off the board. Seven centers were drafted that draft night. Fourteen years later, all were in and out the league, with Williams playing 106 games more than his nearest draft classmate at his position (Felton Spencer). 1991 Melvin Cheatum Position: Small Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Late First to Early Second Cheatum, along with NBA's Robert Horry, James Robinson and Latrell Sprewell, helped lead Alabama to three NCAA tournaments with two NCAA Sweet 16 appearances and three SEC tournament titles. It was Cheatum, not Horry, who was often asked to be the key player in tight situations. In college he often relied on his athleticism, finishing ability, rebounding, solid defensive ability and great running of the floor to produce. Yet as a draft prospect, Cheatum lacked the size and height to be an NBA power forward, and lacked perimeter shooting and passing to be a legit small forward. Being a tweener proved too much for him to overcome on draft night. Brian Shorter Position: Small Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Late first to Early Second Coming out of high school Shorter was often ranked among the top 10 players in the nation. This McDonaldâs All American did not disappoint, earning Big East Rookie of the Year and two All-Big East 1st team selections. Expectations were high as Shorter headed into his senior year. Pittsburgh was also armed with future draftee Darren Morningstar. But an unusual viral infection plagued Shorter's production and overall ability. As Pitt's medical staff struggled to diagnose the infection, the virus worked its way through Shorterâs system, attacking his muscles to the point where his stamina, upper body strength and leaping ability were severely diminished. To compound issues, Shorterâs lack of height and inability to handle the ball or shoot with range all but sealed his fate on draft night. 1992 Joe Harvell Position: Small Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Late First to Earl Second Harvell was a scoring machine in the SEC, averaging 25 points a game. He definitely had the look of a potential draftee. He played in a conference that housed 1st round picks like Shaq OâNeal, Robert Horry and Latrell Sprewell. Many felt Harvell was offensively advanced over Horry & Sprewell, but defensively they were better. Harvell stayed, only to clash with a new coach in a new system where he saw his stock take hits that he would never recover from. Â  James Forrest Position: Power Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Top 15 Out of Wake Forest as one of the highest rated prospects in the nation, Forrest came with high expectations and did not disappoint. After an excellent sophomore season where he put on a dominating clinic in the 1993 ACC Tournament, many felt he was an early entry shoe-in, yet Forrest stayed in school and never saw his draft status improve. In the next two years he encountered weight problems and inconsistent play with poor team results. In 1995, at the end of his final collegiate year, Forrest stood by as he watched his teammate, Travis Best, go on to be drafted. 1994 Kendrick Warren Position: Small Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Late First Warren came into little known VCU with a huge high school reputation. The 1990 McDonaldâs All American didn't disappoint. His coach, Sonny Smith, had NBA ties as the former head coach of Auburn where he sent Charles Barkley and Chuck Person to the league. At VCU Warren scored 1,858 points with 1,049 rebounds, and still remains VCU's all-time season leader in 5 statistical categories. Yet his shaky perimeter and free throw shooting all sunk his draft status. 1995 Scotty Thurman Position: Small Forward Mock Draft Consensus: Late First to Early Second Thurman was one of Arkansas coach Nolan Richardsonâs best players during their 1994 & 1995 championship runs. Many thought that with Thurmanâs silky shooting and fundamentally sound play made him a first round candidate. Unfortunately his lack of defensive ability, quickness and ability to create off the dribble severely hurt Thurmanâs stock. With his high profile visibility on one of the nationâs best teams, Thurman was media's poster boy as why you shouldn't leave school early. One has to wonder if aÂ year earlier could have made the difference. (L to R) Thurman & Forrest These players had varying degrees of success. Some would love to blame the internet, but online hype didnât really exist at the time. Instead, players were listed in newspapers, all the way up to the nationally syndicated level. Next weâll examine 1996-2000, when the internet began to have greater influence on mock drafts. Add new comment # Team Pick Ht. Wt. Pos. College Year 1. Utah Jabari Parker 6-8 240 PF/SF Duke FR. 2.

Thatâs right I said it. Re-read that line a couple times. Let it burn into your cranium. Now I know what everyone will say - they didnât even win the title that year! They lost to Duke. Yes, I know that. But letâs cut through all the PC rules and regulations when it comes to picking the best team of all time and just come out honest and swinging. For those who think the argument ends with the fact they didnât win. Just stop it. Thatâs like saying the 1983 North Carolina State Wolfpack âs victory over Phi Slamma Jamma meant they were better. Thatâs the beauty of college basketball and its blemish. You only have to beat a team once to win. This isnât the NBA where you need to be consistent in a best of seven series. Hell, Iâll even go on record and say the 1990 UNLV squad belongs in the top 10 of all time teams. I call this a fact that few can argue, yet there are few that will even take on that argument because of all the variables at play with the hated Runninâ Rebels. But the 1990 team is for another article at another time. Today is about the 1991 team. Hereâs an important piece of the UNLV puzzle. Everyone, and I mean everyone, hated UNLV. People can try to deny this, but UNLV was like the Yankees in baseball, the Notre Dame of college football and the Mike Tyson of boxing. Why, you might ask? Because they were vicious and explosive, while destroying everyone by an average of 26.7 points. Itâs a record that still stands 5th all time. During the UNLV golden age they won an impressive 45 games straight when you include their final 11 games of the 1990 championship season. Say what you want about level of competition, but while the Big West wasnât the Pac-10 or ACC, think of Memphis in conference USA. Some teams were ranked. Most werenât that great. But unlike Conference USA with its marginal prospects, the Big West had several solid pro prospects in Randy Brown , Cedric Ceballos , Lucious Harris and Byron Russell . To make things interesting Coach Jerry Tarkanian always scheduled a tough out of conference schedule that, in 1991, included Arkansas (2), Michigan State (4), and Louisville (23), all top 25 opponents at the time. Even the Late John Wooden couldnât stand the idea that the 1991 Rebels were better than any of his teams. When talk began to hit the Wizard of Westwood earâs, the typically humble and reserved Wooden quickly spoke that his UCLA teams were better than UNLV, but also quickly recanted in a separate interview proclaiming that 1991 UNLV is up there and no college basketball team is the best ever.

The first 6 picks rolled through with a mild surprise in Tristan Thompson who surged to number 4, and Brandon Knight who dropped out of the top 5 despite several NBA Draft prognosticators labeling him the number 3 pick. Utah wisely chooses Enes Kanter while Knight's fall lasted until Detroit scooped him with the 8th pick. What happened next not only left me scratching my head, but made me question if scouting had really been done. Bismack Biyombo has been glorified as a Ben Wallace clone since dominating 2011 Hoop Summit with a triple double showing. He also has some unique circumstances that almost mirror rising NBA player and Congo native, Serge Ibaka . Charlotte committed hard and drafted Biymombo early at 7. After all, how could they not be getting something similar to Ibaka? The big picture though has become clouded and even though both players have alarming similarities, they quickly stop after the heritage and Junior Spain basketball upbringing. Unlike Biyombo, Ibaka at 16 had a much more refined game with solid perimeter shooting, ball handling and is a much more explosive player. In basic basketball Jargon, at 16-years-old, Ibaka's fundamentals were light years away from 18-year-old Biyombo's. Even when you look at their work in the LEB (Spain's second division Basketball League), Ibaka trumps Biyombo in every category. It amazes me that the NBA doesn't draft high schoolers because they claim that extra year of school is good for them (maybe two, depending on how this year's Collective Bargaining Agreement shapes up), but upon seeing Biyombo's triple double assault on USA's Junior National team, NBA GM's decided he has the goods. Never mind that the US had no true center. Heck, I could even argue they had no true power forward, as UNC bound James McAdoo is a combo forward and Kentucky Bound Anthony Davis is a mere 195 pound forward who is still getting his body together after his astronomical 8-inch growth spurt after his sophomore year. These guys are hardly NBA bangers but yet some acted shocked on how Biyombo dominated them physically. The point is, he isn't a sure thing and has more questions surrounding him than any player drafted in the top 10. Read more... Comments (1) Six Degrees of Separation is the popular theory that you can link a person to anyone else in the world through acquaintances with an average of only six people separating the two individuals. So what's Dwayne Wade got to do with Ty Cobb Babe Ruth? Follow the trail that connects Dwayne through one of the greatest lines in Six Degress that will span 5 Hall of Fame players in baseball and basketball... Michael Jordan hand picked Dwayne Wade to join his Jordan Brand Shoe Company through a shoe endorsement deal. Dean Smith coached Michael Jordan while at North Carolina from 1982-84. Frank McGuire asked Dean Smith in 1958 to join him as an assistant on his coaching staff. Joe Lapchick was a close friend to Frank McGuire through his college years and later in life. Babe Ruth would often play barnstorming basketball games with Lapchick's Celtics teams during the 1920's Rip Collins played with Ruth on the 1920 1921 New York Yankee teams as well as Ty Cobb's Detroit Tigers of 1923 - 1926 seasons. Dwayne Wade might have the single greatest six degrees of seperation that leads back into the 1920's. Add new comment NBA Draft Review of 2003 DATE: June 26, 2003 Site: Theatre at Madison Square Garden, New York DRAFT OBSERVATIONS Through the years, there have been few NBA drafts with a surefire lock for the number one pick. Lebron James was ranked by most experts and journalists as the number one amateur player in the world. During his senior year, The Lebron Effect was tremendous leading up to the draft. His popularity and fame were so high that the demand for his games to grew in epic proportions. Auction websites such as EBay were selling video taped games for $25-$50.00 dollars. ESPN took it a step further and commenced to broadcast nationally televised games during his senior season. Even casual fans were tuning in to catch a glimpse of the next potential Michael Jordan. And unlike many of the Early Entry underclassmen, freshman Carmelo Anthony led Syracuse to the NCAA Championship while sophomore sensation Dwyane Wade took Marquette to the final four. For the first time in a long while, the NBA had three stars in Anthony, Wade and Lebron, who had already established fan bases before playing in the NBA. But add to this list the Serbian sensation, Darko Milicic who just turned 18, and had already played two years of professional ball in Yugoslavia's top league. Scouts and GM's were enamored with his height and shooting ability. UNLV's Marcus Banks went from being an early second draft pick to one of the hottest names in the draft. Through private workouts Banks' stock went through the roof. Maciej Lampe . Although considered by many to be one of the top ten talents in the draft, he unbelievably slid out of the first round before being the first second round selection by the New York Knicks . Lampe's stock plummeted when his overseas team, Complutense, sent memos to all of the NBA informing them that Lampe had a huge buyout and they still maintained his rights. This information made a lot of team's leery about drafting a player in the first round that could have legal problems. Jason Kapono and Luke Walton didn't perform the way many scouts and GM's hoped and although they weren't marked as definite draft prospects, they did the best job of improving their draft stock. Slovenian guard Sani Becirovic also deserves admiration for coming back from two serious knee injuries that were so devastating, many called it career ending. Had Becirovic come out two years earlier, he quite possibly would have been a top twenty selection. Unfortunately, his injuries kept him out of the game for a year and he had opportunity for only one mediocre workout before the draft. Many will tell you he was probably only at 35-40 percent of his true playing level. Nevertheless, Becirovic's success as a draftee is a testament to his perseverance and ability as a ball player. Sofoklis Schortsanitis and Darko Milicic were allowed to enter the NBA draft despite being age seventeen when they declared. Commissioner David Stern pointed to the league's former rule that stated a player must be eighteen when they declare for the draft. Stern then went on to say that both Schortsanitis and Milicic were eligible if they were eighteen at the time of the draft. This worked out great for Milicic, but would Schortsanitis been better served staying overseas? He dropped out of the first round and was selected in the second round, 34th overall, by the Los Angles Clippers. Nedzad Sinanovic had many wide-eyed and open mouthed. After almost three years with the Bosnian Army, Sinanovic decided he was going to play basketball again. His agent had him signed and on his way to the Spanish club, Unicaja Malaga. Here, the raw prospect would workout, gain experience and training, but would never actually play for the team, giving him extremely low exposure to scouts and GMs. During this time Sinanovic developed tremendous potential, and because of his age, was automatically eligible for the draft. But with a non-English speaking agent and virtually no publicity, the prospect of going undrafted was at the door. This fate, however, was what Sinanovic was hoping for. Going undrafted equated to more dollars for the player. As a free agent, he would have bypassed the rookie pay scale and been able to sign a contract with any NBA team for an unrestricted amount. Needless to say, gone are the days of international surprises!

Perhaps the deepest position in the draft was the small forward position. Eleven small forward were drafted in the first round. When it comes down to talent and high quality role players this class proved that you dont need a franchise rich draft to have a good crop of prospects. Chicago Bulls dominated for several years with six NBA championships featuring three Hall of Fame players in their starting lineup. What rival wouldnt wait and hope for a downfall? Their faith was fully rewarded as the Bulls finished the season 13-37, far from the championship glory that fans and media grew accustomed to. The Bulls vilified GM Jerry Krause, blaming him for purposely breaking up the team while outside accusers also scrutinized him. This draft brought increased pressure for Krause to choose wisely. Owning the first pick, he had several options. Krause could take Steve Francis, the high flying crowd pleaser from Maryland, Lamar Odom , the talented but troubled youngster, or Elton Brand, the dominate big man from Duke who was arguably the best player on the best team in the nation. With few applause Krause chose steady big man Elton Brand. Some questioned Brands size but Krause was convinced that he would not only succeed but potentially reach star status. A year later, Krause proved himself correct when Brand was named Co-Rookie of the Year with Steve Francis . Krause also made another excellent choice in Ron Artest , a native New Yorker like Brand. In their high school days the two joined forces on their AAU team and became fast friends. In the end, Krause blew the tandem up by trading Brand and Artest in the span of three seasons. Since then Artest and Brand have become All-Stars among the leagues best for their respective teams. The dream is not to be drafted by an NBA team but to be drafted by the right NBA team. Steve Francis looked as happy as a man on his way to a root canal. He literally threw his hands in the air after hearing his name called as if saying Why me Lord. Before the start of the draft, Francis informed the Vancouver Grizzlies that he didnt want to be selected by a team too far from his Grandmother in Maryland. She had raised him after his mothers unfortunate death. After the draft, Steve Francis (in John Elway fashion), forced the Grizzlies to make a trade with the Houston Rockets . This was a destination that was extremely pleasing to Francis. He was elated with the thought of staying closer to home (for those who might not know, NFL player John Elway was originally drafted by the Colts. He and his father apparently had problems with the Colts coach at the time. Elway was traded to the Denver Broncos where he became a Hall of Fame quarterback). Francis has been a three-time All Star, but still has reportable character issues and is viewed by some as a spoiled athlete. Jonathan Bender , who by many accounts was a talented blue chip college bound player, still looked a few years shy from entering the NBA. No one envisioned the 205 pound 6-11 high school Center going pro, but that all changed suddenly when he played in the Annual McDonalds All American game, the showcase for the best high school talent in the land. Bender dominated the game shooting three point baskets with amazing fluidness and displaying unbelievable athleticism. He even broke the legendary McDonalds scoring record of Michael Jordan - 30 points. In 31 minutes Bender had 31 Points, 10 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a performance that would catapult him to the top of the NBA draft board. But Toronto never kept Bender and immediately traded him to the Pacers. Sadly, Bender never reached his potential as injuries withered away his progress. Finally, chronic knee problems lead to his retirement in 2006 at the tender age of 25. Jeff Foster from Southwest Texas State . Foster captured teams interest with a strong showing at Portsmouth and the Nike Desert Classic. Next Jerry West , in his typical fashion, drafted Division III Devean George of Augsburg College. This small school player earned All Tournament Honors at Portsmouth and became the first Division III player to be drafted since Lamont Strothers in 1991. Lastly, Antwain Smith was drafted out of St. Pauls college in Virginia after an above average showing in Portsmouth. These players proved that despite the major college conferences, theres a place for small school players in the NBA. Leon Smith was an extremely talented big man who stood out in Chicagos public league. The Illinois Player of the Year had a number of Division I scholarships lined up. In the end it was down to Fresno State or the NBA. Despite unfavorable reports about his draft status (pegged by many to be a second rounder), Smith entered the NBA draft with barely as much buzz as fellow teen phenom Jonathan Bender. San Antonio gave up Smith as part of deal with the Dallas Mavericks . Nelson knew Smith was a bit of a project and wanted his big man overseas to develop a little more before entering the NBA. Smith however rejected this notion and insisted that he was NBA material. Physically he was ready but it became clear that his mental capacity was still immature and self-esteem battered. Since the age of five Smith had been a ward of the state, living in various foster homes and shelters. Two weeks after signing, he attempted suicide by swallowing 250 aspirins. In an alleged deranged state, he was found in his home passed out wearing green war paint. After being released from the hospital Smith again found trouble when he threatened his ex-girlfriend and damaged her mothers car. He was then put in a program for psychiatric treatment and payment arrangements were made for his 1.45 million dollar contract to be disbursed over 10 years. Smith has made two returns to the NBA, one with the Atlanta Hawks in 2001-02 and the other with Seattle Supersonics in 2003-04. He continues to receive treatment and play basketball for minor league teams. Wang Zhi-Zhi drew a host of blank stares on draft night. While a superstar in China, Zhi-Zhis rise onto radar of pro NBA scouts came about during the 1996 Olympic Games were he had a very good game against the U.S. dream team with 12 points and 7 rebounds. Even more mysterious to NBA officials (and even Chinese reporters) is how Zhi-Zhi could be selected when he never declared for the draft. Every document that was available at the time listed Wang Zhi-Zhi as being born in 1979. Thanks to his agent, the Mavericks were able to get a hold of Wangs true birth date showing the legal documents that indicated that Zhi-Zhi was born in 1977 and making him draft eligible. It took two years for Zhi-Zhi to join Dallas when Chinese basketball officials finally allowed him to pursue his NBA career. After Wang left for the NBA his Bayi Rockets team that was so dominate in the Chinese Basketball Association had been beaten by the Shanghai Sharks with there promising newcomer Yao Ming . Yao then went on to become the first pick in the 2002 NBA draft. Andrei Kirilenko was only 18 years old but already had three years of professional basketball experience in Russia. Blessed with tremendous athleticism and potential, Kirilenko had pro scouts buzzing with excitement. Utah took him with the knowledge that he would stay overseas for a while. Two years later Kirilenko made his debut in the NBA where he has blossomed as not only one of the most versatile players, but also one of the best small forwards in the game today. Unlike Kirilenko who had a lot of buzz, Manu Ginobili was a relatively obscure commodity. Ginobili was known as a solid player in the second division of Italy but not a future NBA prospect. In Europe young players are often identified and put on premier teams to slowly develop. Ginobili played for his father Jorges local team Bahia Blanca while growing up in Argentina. This explains why he was under the radar to many pro scouts. Ginobili stayed overseas for four years after being drafted where he became a superstar. Suddenly teams were grimacing about this 57th pick joining forces with Spurs Tony Parker and Tim Duncan . Needless to stay these worries were well founded as Ginobili helped San Antonio win two world championships. He further established his talent leading Argentina to a gold medal in the 2004 summer Olympics.

If you were a fan during this time, there were usually two things you either hated or loved, depending on your loyalties. For many, it was the hot-dogging of Michigan's Fab Five, and for others, it was Iowa's physical ball club. The focal point for opponents and fans often resided with Chris Street and his aggressive pursuit of rebounds, mastered with the rare ability to pick up the spirits of the Iowa faithful with a mere fist pump. When people talk about Chris Street's basketball ability, you wont hear about 40-point games or ridiculous stats. His real talents arent found in the quick glimpse of his player profile. To discover Streets worth, you had to see him play. More than anything, his willingness to compete against anyone or do anything, from diving on the floor to providing a tough box out, endeared him with all of Iowa. No just the university the entire state of Iowa. If you were from Iowa, you liked Chris Street . It was that simple. But for the rest of the country, proof of his talent concedes with what he accomplished in his three years with the Iowa Hawkeye program. Street appeared on scout's radar following a solid freshman year. During that time he became a full time starter and ended the year among the Big Tens leaders in field goal percentage and rebounds. Despite playing in a conference that would produce 13 draft picks in the span of the two years (1993 1994) Street remained consistent and ever improving. Read more... Comments (4) With the 2010 NBA Draft now a thing of the past, history books are beginning to reveal something interesting; I dare to even call it alarming, and it may prove to be a budding new trend: the international basketball market is in severe decline. Take a look at this past 2010 NBA draft. There was only one international draft pick in the first round, Kevin Seraphin . And after Seraphin suffered a minor knee injury, it was rumored that he might withdraw from the draft. That would have meant no international draft picks in the first round, a scenario that hasnât occurred since the 1997 NBA Draft . As for round two, there were only five foreign picks. So why was Seraphin the only international first rounder? When Donatas Motiejunas and Jan Vesely both pulled out of early entry, no doubt the international market took a hit. Most early entries withdraw from the draft because of poor draft status, but this was not the case with Motiejunas and Vesley. Although both prospects were projected as locks in the first round, there was speculation that contract buyouts could hinder Vesleyâs and Motiejunasâs prospects. But even if you factor in these two âno showsâ?, the numbers still dictate a decline. Read more... Comments (1) In cities across America there are basketball legends who are embraced locally. Anfernee Hardaway gets this respect in Memphis. In many ways he can be considered the king in Memphis â royalty in basketball as best to ever grace the cityâs courts. And like every king with his royal heritage, there will be others who possess similar noble swag. Lorenzen Wright can be counted among nobles in that city. He is the Baron of Memphis basketball. Lorenzen Wright at Memphis Wright can claim such status in this city due to his University of Memphis pedigree and the upbringing of his father, Herb, who was a talented basketball player in his own right. Wrightâs lineage is marked with basketball royalty only shared by a select few. From a young age he learned perseverance and toughness as he witnessed his father overcome adversity after being wheelchair bound. Herb played professionally and starred at Oral Roberts, although not a spectacular player, he understood the game and dabbled overseas before returning to Memphis. While at a local community center, thugs shot Herb in the back in retaliation for his breaking up a fight earlier that evening. Despite this adversity he continued to teach Lorenzen the game and even earned a head coaching spot at Shelby Community College on the womenâs team. Wrightâs grandmother raised him in Oxford, Mississippi for most of his life. With his parents in Memphis, Wright would frequently visit his father and spent a good portion of the summer months with his parents receiving training on his game. Wright played his first two years at Lafayette high school in Mississippi, taking his team to the state title as a sophomore before losing to Mississippi powerhouse Lanier (led by Georgetown bound Jerry Nichols). But how could a player born and, for the most part, raised in Mississippi endear himself to the people of Memphis? After a fateful conversation with his parents, Lorenzen made the difficult decision to leave Lafayette High School and play his remaining years at Booker T. Washington in Memphis. The decision proved to be a great move, as he raised his profile on the court, averaging 27.6 points, 18.1 rebounds, and 6.6 blocks per game in his senior year while leading his team to the Tennessee state quarterfinals. Wright also earned a spot on McDonaldâs prestigious All American team and was often viewed as a top 20 player in his class. Read more... Add new comment More Articles...
