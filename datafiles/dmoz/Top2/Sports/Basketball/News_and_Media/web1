Spadaford Will Transfer Former South Side star Ryan Spadaford has decided to transfer from the Naval Academy to another school for his sophomore season. Wizards EBA Champs! The Wizards, Long Islands pro basketball team, won the 2012-2013 EBA Championship in thrilling fashion, first defeating the Westchester DutchmenÂ 101-92 behindÂ behind 27 points and 7 assists from Hempsteads Aubin Scott and 20 points and 10 rebounds from Malvernes Anthony Cox,Â  and then the next night taking a thriling 118-116Â decision overÂ  the Harrisburg Horizon forÂ the 2012-13 EBA Title. Scott and Cox once again led the way, with 29 and 25 points respectively.Â  DETAILS NBA Report As the regular season draws to a close, wereÂ happy to report that three LI players are in the starting line-ups ofÂ NBA teams, andÂ another makes a significant contribution off the bench.Â Were very proud of all of them, but we might be most proud of AmityvillesÂ  Mike James , who now starts for the Dallas MavericksÂ despite starting the season without a team. Â Initially signed to a 10 day contract, the 37 year old James moved into the starting lineup on March 6, and the Mavericks have gone 8-3 since then to get within two games of the Los Angeles Lakers for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. James had a season high 17 points in a big win over Utah, and has handed out an average of 6 assists in the last 8 games.Â Next on the list is North BabylonsÂ  Danny Green , who is averaging 10.6 ppg for the San Antonio Spurs and has started every game for them as they have compiledÂ the best record in the NBA. Green does a little bit of everything for the San Antonio, and does it well, filling the stat sheet while knocking down threes at a 44% clip and free throws at an 83% clip.

Donovan Tall USA Task By Team USA standards, theÂ 19U team, composed mostly of college players,Â has struggled in recent history, winning only two world championshipsÂ going back to 1987.Â  No other country has won more than one in that time frame, but expectations are always high for Team USA. Why only the modest succes? Some of the top players in the age group, this yearÂ Kentuckys Nerlens Noel for example,Â leave school early for the NBA Draft, while others are just starting their college careers and are hesitant to miss workouts with their new teams. That makes it a difficult task to put together an elite squad capable ofÂ beating the worldâs best. Rockville Centreâs Billy Donovan, who coached the Florida Gators to two National Championships and the USA 18U team to a FIBA Americas gold medal last summer, has been given that responsibility.Â His roster is now set, and his coaching staffÂ in place, and the team will make final preparationsÂ for a June 27th first round match-up with the Ivory Coast.

Manhattan Over Pride Hofstra held RoslynsÂ  George BeamonÂ  to just 6 points, but the Jaspers rallied past the Pride for a 66-59 victory.Â  STORY Belmont Stops Hofstra The truth is, we were all worried that Hofstra might not be competitive this year, but Coach Mihalich has done a great job and theyve been in every game except Louisville so far. No sin in that.

GO TO BOYS RECAP GO TO GIRLS RECAP Stunning Transfers We reported earlier that two star catholic league players - Jessie Govan from St. Marys and Nigel Carter from St. Anthonys - had transferred to new schools in the last week, and we have subsequently learned that two more good players have left St. Anthonys - Anfernee Casimir, who joined Carter at Brentwood, and Leland Williams, who has enrolled at Amityville! Wow! The St. Marys big man mysteriously left a team loaded with young talent that might have contended for state championships for years to come, while Carter and Casimir also left a team loaded with talent, but transferred to an even more highly regarded Brentwood program that will also add recuperating star forward Femi Olujobi to a line-up that has been dominant all summer and fall. Williams bolsters an excellent Amityville line-up that is expected to get little competition in Suffolk Class A this season and will be a strong contender to go upstate once again. Despite the blows, both St. Marys and St. Anthonys remain NSCHSAA contenders, a tribute to their programs.Â  AROUND THE NET DPs Edmead To Wagner AJ Price Update Mike James Update College Report Manhattan College seniorÂ  George Beamon Â from Roslyn was named to the All-MAAC Preseason mens basketball First Team â¦ Junior Â Chavaughn Lewis Â from St. Maryâs and the Marist menâs basketball team has been named to the All-MAAC Preseason Second Teamâ¦.

Stony Brook/AE Preview Original Nets Big Three Girls All-Star Recap âMissed free throws helped decide the exciting first game of the 2013 Alzheimerâs All-Star Basketball Classic, allowing the Suffolk Girls All-Star Team to dramatically come from behind in the final seconds to defeat Nassau 62-61. St. MaryâsÂ  Jordan AgustusÂ  gave Nassau the early lead, completing a three point play, but it remained close in the early going and it was a tie game after a fast break basket by WantaghsÂ  Alex Parlato Â with 12:10 to play in the first half. Back to back jumpers byÂ  Alex Cantwell Â from North Shore put Nassau back on top, but LongwoodsÂ  Kiersten West Â nailed a three pointer from the left wing to cut it to 15-14, and North BabylonsÂ  Makeda Nicholas Â drilled one from the right wing to give Suffolk a 17-15 lead at the 9:42 mark. It was 22-15 Suffolk afterÂ  Chastity Taylor Â from St. Anthonys knocked down a three pointer from the right wing, 25-17 after another three by Nicholas, and then Huntingtons Â  Heather Forster Â banked one off the glass for a 9 point Suffolk lead, but Nassau reeled off 10 straight points to close out the half, 4 by LuHisÂ  Katie Lavelle , and took a 1 point lead into the locker room on two free throws by St. MarysÂ  Mei Lyn Bautista . LuHisÂ  Boogie Brozoski Â stole the ball and scored to open the second half and give Nassau a three point lead, but Nicholas knocked down another three to tie it. Nassau answered right back on Lavelleâs three point play, but a three point play by BellportsÂ  Arella Guirantes , and then her three pointer from left wing put Suffolk back on top. It was 45-39 Suffolk after SoutholdsÂ  Caroline GehringÂ  cut to the basket from the weak side, got the pass and scored, and it became a 7 point game after Guirantes knocked down a three off and inbound play, but a jump hook by Agustus and a basket from underneath by Lavelle cut it to 50-47. Suffolk rebuilt their lead, going up 7 with 3:04 to play after a Guirantes foul line jumper, but a drive by Lavelle and a fast break basket by Bautista cut it to 59-56 with 1:52 showing. Cantwellâs jumper from the right wing made it a 1 point game with 1:22 to go, and after a Suffolk free throw, Augustus drove and tied it at 60 with 24 seconds on the game clock to set up the dramatic ending. Suffolk turned the ball over on the ensuing possession and drew a technical foul call with 13 seconds to play, giving Nassau the opportunity to ice the game, but dodged a bullet when Nassau went 1-4 from the line in the closing seconds to take a slim 1 point lead. That opened the door for Nicholas, who went hard to the basket and scored the game winner. âLightning Expand East After a very successful expansion into Suffolk County, the Lightning program is continuing to push eastward with its move into the Long Island Sportsplex in Sayville. The new program will be under the direction of Suffolk Lightning Director Rob Pavinelli. MORE Boys All-Star Recap After a great girlâs game set the stage, the Alzheimerâs All-Star Basketball Classic boys took the court and delivered another classic, with Suffolk County holding on for a dramatic 82-81 victory. It looked like it might not be a contest as the first half unfolded, with Our Savior New American playersÂ  Damon Wilson Â andÂ  Michael Nzei Â leading Suffolk to a quick 8-2 advantage, but NassauÂ settled in, andÂ  Devonte Greenâs Â three point play brought the western Long Islanders back within one. Green blocked a shot and raced down court for an emphatic dunk to give Nassau a 9-8 lead, but it was short-lived, with Suffolk moving back in front on two free throws by Hills WestâsÂ  Terry Harris . Harris then added a three from the baseline and a coast to coast basket to putÂ Suffolk up 18-11, and SJBâsÂ  Tavon Ginyard Â hit a short pull-up jumper from the baseline to make it 31-21 at the 3:01 mark of the half. It began to look like Eastern Long IslandÂ was taking control when SouthamptonâsÂ  Shaundell Fishburne Â knocked down a 3 pointer from the left wing and added a free throw moments later for a 16 point lead, but Valley Stream CentralâsÂ  Eriq Williams Â sparked Nassau with a driving reverse layup in traffic, and then he drew a foul once again in traffic, going 1-2 from the line, and St. MaryâsÂ  Stephen Milhaven Â rebounded the miss and scored to make it a 38-27 game at halftime. Holy TrinityâsÂ  Brandon Thompson Â opened the second half scoring, cutting the Suffolk lead to single digits, but a turnaround jumper by Harris from just inside the foul line made it 42-29 Suffolk, and then his three pointer from the top made it 45-31. A putback by Hills EastâsÂ  Jordan McCray Â pushed the lead to 17 with 16:53 to play, but a beautiful give and go basket by Green and then his incredible four point play on a fall away jumper from the baseline seemed to get Nassau back into it. Suffolk responded though, with Amityvilleâs Â Mike SmithÂ  scoring on a putback and Harris scoring on the break to make it a 16 point game.Â  Dwayne Danielâs Â teardrop from the lane began the Nassau comeback in earnest, and then LuHiâsÂ  Elijah Bailey Â knocked down a three and his LuHi teammate,Â  Chris Atkinson , stole the ball and found another teammate,Â  Chris Burkley , for a driving basket to cut the defict to 9 with 13:41 to play. Bailey scored again, turning a mad scramble for the ball into a three point play, and then a three pointer by Burkley and Nassau was within 4. It would be a dogfight the rest of the way. FarmingdaleâsÂ  Curtis Jenkins Â tied it with a three pointer from the left baseline at the 10:52 mark, and then he drew a foul on a putback attempt and went 1 for 2 from the line to put Nassau on top, but neither team could take control and the teams traded baskets and free throws right down to the 6:15 mark, when Nzeiâs big tip-in gave Suffolk a 5 point cushion, and then his second tip-in and a Harris free throw put Suffolk up 8 with 4:31 left. Nassau answered with a three pointer from the top by Atkinson, Danielâs three from the baseline, and two free throws by Williams that made it a one point game as the clock dipped under the three minute mark. Daniel then drained a jumper from the left wing to give Nassau a 77-76 lead, but Smith recaptured it with a foul line jumper off an inbound play. Greenâs two big free throws put Nassau back on top with 2:07 remaining, but the lead changed hands again on Wilsonâs baseline drive. Green knocked down two more clutch free throws with 11 seconds left to make it 81-80 Nassau, but Harris drew a foul going hard to the basket with 6 seconds to play and calmly knocked down both free throws for the win. The two Long Island blue-bloods led all scorers: MVP Terry Harris, brother of the NBAâs Tobias Harris, had a game high 22, and Devonte Green, brother of the NBAâs Danny Green, had 21. Shaundell Fishburne was the only other double digit scorer with 12. Girls recap, box scores, and photos to follow. EDITORS INBOX KJ Lee , who is from Huntington, committed to Marist.....

It was the first time that no Long Island team claimed a championship in our 5 years of running tournaments. Competition was fierce in the varsity division, with lots of very close and hard fought games, and the Panthers from New Jersey emerged as champions, coming from behind to defeat a good Bristol Ballers team from Connecticut in the final. Ward Melville, who continues to impress, took home third place with a win over Brentwood. The All City Panthers repeated as JV Champions, defeating the NYC Blue Devils in the final, while the Hilltopper Heat from New Jersey played a memorable double overtime game with NYCâs Knulife on their way to the 9th Grade Championship. A much improved Shooting Stars team took third. The 8th grade title went to the impressive Knulife program, who defeated the LI Saints in the final. A very good CYO team from the St. James program finished third. ALL-TOURNAMENT TEAMS VARSITY DIVISION Michael Almonacy - Brentwood HS, NY Rashaan Spencer - Mt.

Nassau County gave up an early lead, but rallied to defeat Suffolk 113-104 at the 2013 Long Island Public School All-Star Game. BaldwinâsÂ  Miking Richardson Â drained a three pointer and CareyâsÂ  Adrian Denner Â knocked down a jump hook from the lane to get Nassau off to a good start, and then ElmontâsÂ  Tristan Brown Â sliced through the defense and scored to make it 14-7 Nassau with 4:25 gone in the first half. It was 22-12 Nassau after Baldwinâs Â Marvin Chartelain Â knocked down a three from the top, and a fast break basket by West HempsteadâsÂ  Darren Davy Â made it a 14 point game, but Suffolk responded with 6 straight points on free throws by Southamptonâs Â Shaundell Fishburne Â and WesthamptonâsÂ  Devonte Dixon Â and a putback by Sachem EastâsÂ  Jesse Condon .Â  Chris McCollough Â from Harborfields nailed a baseline three pointer to cut the Suffolk deficit to 32-27, but Nassau responded and Chartelainâs three from the left foul line extended put them up 40-30 with 4:35 to play in the half. Suffolk answered with a 10 point run, featuring a left elbow jumper by FloydâsÂ  Brian Samuelson Â and a nice putback by Smithtown EastâsÂ  Ryan Ingarozza , and it was 40 all with 2:34 showing. Another putback by Ingarozza gave Suffolk their first lead at 45-44 with 1:05 to play, and after an exchange of baskets, it remained a one point game at halftime.Â  Suffolk began to build a lead as the second half got underway, with a three by Fishburne putting them up 51-46, and then a putback byÂ  Scott Artis Â from Bellport and a fast break basket by Condon gave them a 9 point advantage in the early going. Back to back three pointers by Artis and Suffolk was up 67-54 and threatening to pull away, but Richardson kept Nassau within striking distance, draining a three from the right wing, and then a drive by Brown and a three pointer by Uniondaleâs Â Shomari ReddÂ  and Nassau was back in it with 14:25 to play. Another three by Redd cut Nassauâs deficit to 4 at the 12:47 mark, a jumper by Davy from just outside the lane made it a 3 point game, and then Redd tied it with a three from the top. After a Suffolk free throw, BaldwinâsÂ  Paul Colson Â put Nassau back on top 85-83 with a three from the deep left wing, and Brownâs fast break basket and Chartelainâs three from the right wing made it 100-93 Nassau with 4:45 remaining. Suffolk closed the gap to 3 on a fast break basket byÂ  Terrence ThomasÂ  with 2:43 to play, but Redd drained another big three to make it 105-99 Nassau with 2:05 left. Suffolk began to foul, but three straight 1 out of 2s from the line went unanswered and Nassau was in good shape, and then Brown removed all doubt with a fast break basket with 40 seconds on the clock to make it 110-99.Â Miking RichardsenÂ led Nassau with 23 points, Shomari ReddÂ had 21, Marvin ChartelainÂ finished with 19, Darren Davy 14 points, and Tristan Brown 9 points and 10 assists. Shaundell FishburneÂ led Suffolk with 22 points, Jesse Condon had 15, Devonte Dixon 14, and Ryan Ingarozza 11.Â  Dr. J In Town!

Â  LuHi Crushes QHSC The Queens High School of Teaching led 21-17 after one quarter, but Devonte Green, Losini Kamara, and Chris Burkley led a second quarter rally that put the Crusaders in front 48-30 at the half, and then Marvin Prochet and Robyn Missa led the charge that blew it open in the third quarter and carried them to a resounding 97-54 victory. Chris Atkinson did a great job running the offense and scoring when he had to, and picked up the MVP trophy as a result. The win gave Long Island teams a 3-1 victory over NYC at the showcase held in LuHis gym. 12/8 St. MarysÂ Rocks Far Rock St. Maryâs is another team everyone is wondering about. They were expected to be one of the best teams in the state this season, but during the off-season, their two highest profile players transferred out. Fortunately for Gaels fans, Steve Milhaven is still there and appears to be healthy, and Patrick Jackson is still there too, and the Gaels also have some talented freshmen in 6â6 Chris Coalman and 6â11 Nicholas Richards, both of whom look capable of stepping up into big roles. The bad news is they are freshmen, and will undoubtedly have some growing pains, and there also isnât much depth. Against Far Rockaway, Milhaven made it clear that this is his team now, leading them to a convincing 69-48 win with 36 points and 11 rebounds, including a one man second half run that turned a close game into a comfortable win. Jackson added 13 points and 9 assists. Â 12/8 Amityville In OT! In a classic December match-up, two teams that would normally not meet until deep into the playoffs faced off in a barn burner, with 3rd ranked Amityville coming from behind to defeat 2nd ranked Brentwood 81-78 in overtime. Brentwood got off to a great start once again, just as they had against St. John The Baptist in the first round, with back to back three pointers by sophomore sensation Mike Almonacy givingÂ them a 20-8 lead, but Amityville was not about to be blow out in their own gym, with back to back putbacks by Elijah Rogers Â and Phil McCloud Â and a three pointer by Sean Walters Â from the left wing leading a 7-2 Amityville run to close out the first quarter. Brentwood began to rebuild their lead as the second quarter got underway, with Almonacy scoring back to back, but Amityville countered with a 3 by Walters and a baseline jumper by Mike Smith, part of a 12-3 run capped off by Travis Dickersonâs 3 point play that tied the game at 31. Ali MabletonsÂ  coast to coast basket put Brentwood back on top, and a putback by Kameron Works Â and Almonacyâs drive through the defense gave them a 38-33 lead, but Leland Williams â basket from underneath just before the buzzer made it a 3 point game at halftime.Â Mableton opened the second half with a putback for a 40-35 Brentwood lead, but an off balance leaner by Dickerson and a right wing three pointer by Smith tied it. Again, Brentwood started to rebuild their lead, going up 54-44 on a three pointer by Allen from the top. Vincent Smythe âs drive and pull-up jumper made it 56-44 with 2:54 left in the quarter, but Amityville responded with another run, ignited by Dickersonâs drive and capped off by a three pointer by Smith that made it a 5 point game at the end of three quarters. Smythe opened the fourth with a three pointer from the right baseline, and Casimir stole the ball and scored to give Brentwood a 10 point lead, but back to back three pointers by Smith cut it to 66-63.Â Smythe dunked on a beautifully executed press break andÂ Almonacy scored from underneath to bump the lead back to 7 with 3:30 remaining, but Smith kept it close with a fast break basket. Allen knocked down two free throws shooting 1 and 1 with 2:20 left and the lead was 7 again, but Amityville started to close in, scoring on a drive by Dickerson and a three pointer by Smith that sent the full house into a frenzy. The roar continued asÂ McCloud went to the line with 1:32 remaining and knocked down both free throws to tie it, and then Dickersonâs three pointer from the right wing put the Warriors up by 3 with 23 seconds to play. Brentwood missed their first attempt at the basket in the final seconds, and a mad scramble ensued. The ball ended up in the hands of Almonacy, who dramatically drained a three pointer from the top to tie the game and send it into overtime. Amityville struck first in OT, with Smith scoring a fast break basket, and after a Brentwood free throw, his drive made it 79-76 Warriors. Almonacy cut it to 1 with a fast break basket off a turnover with a minute to play, but the Indians couldnât find the basket down the stretch, and a free throw by Malcolm Mathis Â with 27 seconds left and another by Dickerson with 17 seconds left gave Amityville a 3 point win. 12/6 Titans Crush Holy Cross Holy Trinity has struggled against teams from the city in recent years, but it looks like this years team might be different. The fourth ranked Titans jumped out in front right from the start and rolled to a 76-40 win over Holy Cross. Jimmy Golaszewski led the way with 28 points and Jack Sixsmith added 16. 12/4 Massapequa Over Danes The HjemlyÂ  team from Denmark had some talented players and were well coached, but Massapequa would be a tough matchup for anybody, and the Chiefs rolled to a 74-56 victory.Â Massapequa used a balanced attack to build a 20-5 first quarter lead, and thenÂ  Dylan BalducciÂ  errupted for 5 second quarter three pointers and they cruised home from there.Â 12/4 Get 20% Off At Dicks!

The battle for bragging rights in Levittown went to MacArther once again this year, withÂ the GeneralsÂ registeringÂ a 59-41 win over Division. The games have been one sidedÂ recently, and although MacArther raced out to an 8-0 lead in this one behind a three pointer and a steal and basket byÂ  Tom McAndrew ,Â  Division stayed within striking distance most of the way.Â  Kyle McLoughlins Â three pointer from the left wing and a low post basket byÂ  Zack Cronin Â made it a 2 point game late in the first quarter, but McAndrew responded with a 3 from the top andÂ  Greg Baumstein Â converted a 3 point play and it was 16-8 Generals at the first quarter buzzer. A putback byÂ  Joe Tracey Â cut it to 18-11 as the clock dipped under the 6 minute mark in the second quarter, but MacArthur answered withÂ 7 straight points on aÂ hook shot by Baumstein, a three byÂ  Brian PerezÂ  from left wing, and a fast break basket byÂ  Greg SchachterÂ  and they ledÂ 27-13 with 2:56Â to playÂ in the half. Four straight free throws byÂ  Nick Spitalieare Â and the lead was down toÂ 10, butÂ  Ryan Cunninghams Â three pointer just before the buzzer made it 32-19 at intermission.Â Varelas drive from the left wing cut it to 32-23 early in the third quarter, but MacArthur refused to let Division back into it andÂ began to take control on aÂ steal and basket byÂ  Tom MelendezÂ  and a steal a tough fall away jumper by McAndrew that gave them a 13 point lead with 4:50 to play in the quarter. A baseline three pointer by McAndrew,Â a fast break basket byÂ  Jared WolfeÂ  off a turnover,Â and a basket byÂ  Paul DeMartino Â from underneath made it 44-25. Tracey and McLaughlin cut it to 44-29 with free throwsÂ just beforeÂ  the quarter ended. Â  Jack WallÂ  opened the fouth quarter with a fast break basket for MacArthur, and Division never seriously challenged the rest of the way. 12/4 Tu Holloway Update After a great college career, Hempsteads Tu Holloway is playing overseas and waiting forÂ an opportunity to play in the NBA.Â Â  VIDEO SJB Stumbles St. John The Baptist came into the season ranked 6th in the Preseason Sweet 16, but lost their opener 81-73 to Class AA Thurgood Marshall of the PSAL. Preseason All-Long Island selectionÂ  Tavon Ginyard Â had a career high 46 points, including a school record 23 made free throws, and led a second half rally that cut a 16 point deficit to 4, but the Cougars couldnt quite close the gap. SJB was missing starterÂ  BryanÂ Sinclair , Â and Preseason All-Long Island selectionÂ  Kyle Williams Â spent much of the game on the benchÂ in foul trouble. 11/30 Ward Melville Falls To QHST Two Class AA programs on the rise met in an early season intersectional contest, with the Queens High School Of Teaching holding off Ward Melville 56-53 at Ward Melville. In typical New York City style, QHST applied the pressure early, and Ward Melville struggled with it, falling into a 29-16 hole mid way through the second quarter, but the Patriots began to settle in as the half wound down, and a three pointer byÂ  Brandon HartÂ  from straight on cut the deficit to 6 with 2:20 to play. It was 32-27 QHST at the half. Michael OâLeary opened the second half with a three pointer from the right foul line extended, and Daniel Isaacâs three from the left wing made it 39-30 Queens with 5:42 to go in the third quarter, but Ward Melville reeled off three straight baskets - a jumper by Hart, a basket from underneath byÂ  Gabe Brown , and a fast break basket byÂ  Andre AudigeÂ  off a loose ball, and it was a 3 point game at the 4:10 mark. Back to back baskets by Brown, the second on a well executed pick and roll play, cut it to 42-40, and a putback byÂ  Russell WintersÂ  with 1:54 left in the quarter made it a 1 point game, but OâLeary nailed a three with time running down and it was 46-42 QHST with three quarters in the books. Brandon Anderson opened the final quarter with a fast break basket off a turnover, and Supandeep Singâs beautiful drive from the left wing made it 50-42 Tigers in the early going, but 4 straight points byÂ  Phil Carballeira , 2 on a nice running hook shot, and a three point play by Winters and the Patriots were back within 1 with 4:51 to play. Isaac answered with a three from the baseline to make it 53-49, and the Tigers had opportunities to pad their lead the next two times down the court, but missed four straight free throws to keep Ward Melville within striking distance with 3:05 on the clock. The Patriots took advantage, with Winters scoring back to back baskets to tie it at 53 as the clock dipped under one minute, but Sonny Okorie came through for QHST with what turned out to be game winning free throws at the 40 second mark. Ward Melville had two clean looks at the basket as the clock ran down, but neither shot would fall and QHST held on for a 56-53 victory. Sing finished with a game high 17 points for QHST, and Isaac added 12. Winters led Ward Melville with 16.Â  12/2 WARD MELVILLE BOOK Â Â Â Â  QHST BOOK 8th Grade/SunÂ Champion KnuLife St. Anthonys Beats Carey With the unexpected loss of two projected starters, there were a lot of questions about this years St. Anthonys team, but it looks like the Friars will be contenders once again this season after they pulled away from a good Carey team for a 51- 40 victory in their opener. Carey is in Nassau Class A this season, and will also be a contender, returning a balanced squad led by Long Island All-StarÂ  Adrian Denner , and the two teams went toe to toe in the early going, with freshmanÂ  Chris KellyÂ  giving the Friars a 10-7 lead at the first quarter buzzer on a putback and a free throw.Â  CJ BackmanÂ  made it 14-8 St. Anthonyâs with a basket from underneath, butÂ  Andrew Ris Â kept it close with a three pointer from the top.Â  Mike Reinertsen Â was fouled on a three point attempt and knocked down all three free throws to bump the Friar lead back to 6, and a three pointer byÂ  Trey Kinard Â made it 22-13 with just under two minutes to play in the half, but Denner answered with a three from the top,Â  Kieran MurchieÂ  looped to the basket and scored, and Denner knocked down another three from straight on and it was a 1 point game with 29 seconds remaining. Reinertsen knocked down two more free throws in the final seconds to make it 24-21 St. Anthonyâs at the half. Denner opened the second half with an elbow jumper, and then his steal and three point play gave Carey a 26-24 lead, but Kinard responded with a three and the teams exchanged baskets and the lead until Bachmanâs spinning hook shot put the Friars up 31-28 with less than 4 minutes left in the third quarter, and then Kelly knocked down a three from the left baseline to put them up by 6. A baseline drive by Kinnard made it 40-30 St. Anthonyâs with 40 seconds left, but a Ris jumper from the right wing cut the margin to 8 as the quarter ended. The Friars started to take command as the fourth quarter got underway. Kinnard opened the quarter with a three pointer from the left baseline, and then Bachman put back a miss and knocked down a spinning hook shot from the lane to make it 47-32 St. Anthonyâs. Denner tried to keep the Colts alive, following his missed three point attempt with a putback, but Kelly answered with a jumper from the top. A Denner three cut it to 49-40, but with only 1:15 remaining, Carey needed baskets and stops and got neither. Â Joe Licciardiâs Â fast break basket off a turnover made it 51-40 and thatâs the way it ended. As for the questions about the backcourt, Licciardi ran the point for the Friars most of the way and did an excellent job,Â Kinard and Reinertsen played well too in starting roles, andÂ Kelly is an emerging star off the bench. Depth might be a problem, but it looks like St. Anthonyâs is in good shape.Â  12/3 CAREY BOOK Â Â Â Â  ST. ANTHONYS BOOK St. Anthonys Nips Elmont It was a hard fought, back and forth game, but St. Anthonys passed another test, beating 9th ranked Elmont 56-54 on their home court. Elmont jumped in front at the start, with preseason All-Long selection Tristan Brown scoring on a steal and fastbreak basket, and a Keven Chambers steal and dunk made it 6-3 Spartans, but whenever Elmont looked like they were going to build a lead, the Friars responded, and Chris Kellyâs three pointer finally put them on top 12-11. The Spartans then regained the lead on another drive by Brown, and were up 15-12 at the first quarter buzzer on a fastbreak basket by Brett Walker. Kelly tied it at 15 with a fall away jumper with 5:17 to go in the half, and 5 straight point by Jarred Marrow - a baseline three pointer and fast break basket, and it was 20-15 Friars with 4 minutes to play, but neither team could seize the momentum, and it was 25-21 St. Anthonyâs at the half. Brown opened up the second half with a fast break basket after spending much of the second quarter on the bench in foul trouble, but the teams traded baskets until the 4:40 mark, when Brown tied it on another drive in heavy traffic. Kelly answered with a putback for the Friars, but a three pointer by Greg Rhone from the right wing gave Elmont a 33-32 lead with 2:36 left in the quarter, and a putback by Brown made it 38-35 Spartans with 1:19 remaining. Will Lantier scored from underneath to bring St. Anthonyâs back within 1, and a putback by Kinnard gave them a 1 point lead as time ran down, but it was 39 all at the third quarter buzzer after a free throw by Brown finished the scoring. Matthew Graham scored on the break to give Elmont the lead as the fourth quarter got underway, and the back and forth action continued, with two free throws by Joe Licciardi and a jumper by Kelly putting the Friars in front, and a three by Graham from the deep left wing regaining the lead for the Spartans. Kinnard answered with a three from the baseline as the clock dipped under the 5 minute mark, but two free throws by Brown and a runner by Graham and it was 48-46 Elmont. Mike Reinertsenâs big three pointer from the top put St. Anthonyâs up 52-50 with 2:18 to play, and then his rebound and driving basket proved to be the game winner, giving the Friars a 56-52 lead with 25 seconds on the clock. Brown put back a missed three point attempt to make it a 2 point game, but it was too little too late. 12/5 PHOTO AND STATS LATER Brentwood Rocks SJB The much anticipated match-up between #2 Brentwood and #6 St. John The Baptist in the first round of Amityvilleâs annual tournament had an unanticipated result. Brentwood dominated SJB from start to finish, rolling to a 66-50 victory that was not as close as the final score would indicate. It was Brentwoodâs defense that was the real story, completely smothering the Cougars. Brentwood wasted no time, delivering a first round knock-out punch on a pull-up jumper by Mike Almonacy, two free throws by Vincent Smythe, a three by Almonacy from the right wing, a fast break basket by Jamel Allen, a pull-up jumper by Anfernee Casimir, and a fast break basket by Ali Mableton for a 13-0 lead. The stunned Cougars never really recovered. The lead was 26-9 after Allenâs three pointer from straight on, 33-13 after Almonacyâs three point play with 5:44 to play in the first half, and 40-18 after an alley-oop dunk by Allen with 2:25 left. There was a glimmer of hope for St. Johnâs after a three point play by Kyle Williams and a fast break basket by Tavon Ginyard brought the Cougars back within 16, but Brenwood scored the first three baskets of the third quarter on a putback by Allen, a fast break basket by Almonacy, and a tip in by Smythe and the lead was back to 22. Brentwood cruised home from there. They will take on the hosts, #3 ranked Amityville, in the championship game Friday at 7PM. 12/5 Holy Trinity At Buzzer I was really looking forward to seeing #4 Holy Trinity for the first time this season, but I arrived late and when I walked in, they were tied with Wadleigh at 54 with just 1:27 to play. Scanning the book, it had been a tight, back and forth game throughout, and Brandon Thompson was now at the line shooting 1 and 1 looking to give the Titans the lead. He did, knocking down both pressure packed free throws, but Wadleigh countered with a drive from the right wing to knot it up at 56 with 40 seconds left. Holy Trinity regained possession with 5.7 seconds on the clock and called time, and coming out of the time out, they crisply worked the ball around to Peter Alkins on the right baseline, and he buried a three pointer at the buzzer for the dramatic 59-56 win. 12/8 HillsÂ East Stops West In a classic rivalry game, 12th ranked Hills East defeated 13th ranked Hills West 70-63 in front of a packed gym at Half Hollow Hills East High school. It was the first time East had won the match-up since the 2008 - 2009 season, when Tobias and TylerÂ Harris spent the year LuHi. West was determined to show they were still the better team, jumping out to a 9-3 lead on a three pointer and fast break basket by Ross Greenfield, but a tip in and then a three pointer by Jordan McRae and Hills East was up 11-9 with 3:14 to go in the opening quarter. Greenfield wouldnt relinquish the lead without a fight, drilling another three to put West up 12-11, but McRae dunked off an inbound play, Simon stole the ball and scored, and McRae tipped in a missed shot at the buzzer to make it 17-12 East after one. Mike Simon opened the second quarter with two free throws, and then he nailed a three pointer from the left baseline off an inbound play to make it 22-12 East, but the Thunderbirds could not add to the lead, and as the half wound down, Greenfield snuck in behind the defense and scored and Alex Benitez drained a three pointer from the wing to make it 30-25 at intermission. Justin Leonard opened the third quarter with two free throws, Greenfield scored on a putback, and Terry Harris added a free throw to tie the game at 30 all, and then Greenfield put the Colts on top with a fast break basket, but East responded with another run, with Justin Fackler knocking down a short jumper, Grant Rosenberg hitting two free throws and a jumper, and McRae converting a three point play to make it 39-32 Thunderbirds with 3:55 remaining in the quarter. DâNathan Knoxâs basket added to the lead, putting East up 52-41, but West edged back into it,Â drawing within 6 after two free throws by Jamal Starling. Simon hit a fall away three to push the lead to 59-50, and his steal and basket and then two free throws made it 66-54 East, but Erol Parkerâs three pointer from the right baseline with one minute to play kept Westâs hopes alive. Two free throws by Simon gave East an 11 point lead with 40 seconds left, and they held on from there despite some shaky free throw shooting down the stretch. 12/7 Amityville Falls #3 Amityville led most of the way, but could never break loose, and South Shore, NYCs 4th ranked team according to NYC Basketball.com, rallied down the stretch for a 78-71 win. You have to give Coach Agostino credit for putting together a first rate non-league schedule for his Class A Warriors, facing their second straight Class AA heavyweight in as many days, and they came out unintimidated by the towering Vikings, going up 13-8 on Travis Dickersonâs elbow jumper, and then a drive by Mike Smith and Dickersonâs second elbow jumper made it 21-14 with 1:26 to play in the opening quarter. Back to back baskets by Doudmy St. Hilaire narrowed the margin, but Leland Williams knocked down two free throws to give the Warriors a 23-18 lead as the first quarter came to a close. Elijah Rogers opened the second quarter with a three pointer from the left baseline to give Amityville an 8 point lead, but once again they couldnât build on it, and the Vikings whittled it down to 28-27 on a drive down the right side of the lane and then two free throws by Shakur Spencer. Phil McCloud kept the Warriors on top with a putback, and it was 30-27 Amityville at the half. Devyn Wilson drove from the right wing and looped one in from the lane to bring South Shore back within 1 as the third quarter got underway, and St. Hilaire got to a loose ball, scored, drew the foul, and knocked down the free throw to put the Vikings up 32-30, but Smithâs drive down the right baseline, a free throw by Dickerson, and a fast break basket by Williams and Amityville was back on top 35-32. South Shore retook the lead on a three by Wilson from the right baseline and a fast break basket by Tavid McIntosh, and went up 41-37 on a nice basket cut by Spencer, but a fast break basket by Williams and a three pointer by Sean Walters from the baseline made it 42-41 Warriors. The duel continued until Smithâs three pointer and Hubbardâs three point play put the Warriors up by 8 with 2:04 left in the quarter, but two free throws by Cori Johnson and a steal and basket by Wilson cut the margin to 56-52 with three quarters in the books. Ryan Preston scored off an inbound play to bring the Vikings within 2 as the fourth quarter got underway, but Malcolm Mathis answered with a short drive in heavy traffic. The teams traded baskets and free throws, but Amityville continued to hold onto the lead until McIntosh knocked down two free throws to tie it with 4:40 remaining, and then Tyrone Johnsonâs coast to coast runner with 3:52 left put South Shore on top. The Amityville shooters had gone cold and South Shore was dominating the boards, with Preston scoring from underneath, and McIntosh putting back a missed shot to give the Vikings a 6 point lead with 2:40 left. Mathis made it a 4 point game with two free throws to keep the outcome in doubt, but after back to back turnovers, Johnson put the first nail in the coffin, burying a three from the right wing to make it 74-67 South Shore at the 1:52 mark. Dickersons two free throws cut the margin to 5, and it was Amityville ball with 1:39 to play after a charging call, with Mathis drawing a foul and cutting it to 74-71 with two more free throws, but the Warriors would not score the rest of the way, turning it over twice, and two free throws and Prestonâs emphatic dunk iced it. 12/8 Westbury defeated East Meadow HS 57 to 51 in the finals of the Coaches vs Cancer tournament. The tournament was held in honor of coach Martin Bunky Reid, who passed away from cancer in 1993. The Green Dragons were led by Jonathan Dean, who scored 18 points, and Shakel Cafield, who scored 16. Both players were named to the all Tournament team. Westbury outscored East Meadow 22 to 14 in the fourth quarter to earn the comeback win. 12/6 Baldwin Outlasts SJB The featured match-up of the 2013 SJB Holiday Festival was host St. John The Baptist taking on 6th ranked Baldwin, and the game was everything you could ask for, with Baldwin taking home the hardware after a hard fought 76-69 overtime victory. Baldwin got off first, taking a quick 4-0 lead on a runner by Myking Richardson and a basket from the lane by Paul Nosworthy, but the Cougars would not let them take control, and as the first quarter wound down, Brandon Earhartâs jumper from the top gave them a one point lead, and then a fast break basket by Bryan Sinclair made it 14-12 SJB as the first quarter came to a close. Kyle Williams opened the second quarter with a putback for a 4 point St. Johnâs lead, but back to back threes by Shane Gatling put the Bruins on top 18-16, and they held the lead until the 4:04 mark, when Ginyardâs three pointer from the top tied it 25 and sparked a Cougar run. He followed his three with a fast break basket, then Sinclairâs jumper from the right wing and another Ginyard drive made it 31-25 SJB with 2 minutes to go in the half. Richardson countered with a three pointer from the left baseline, Otha Wardâs basket from underneath made it a 1 point game, and after another Ginyard fast break basket, a DMarco Barnes three from the deep left wing tied it at 33 and that was the score at halftime. Ginyard opened the second half with a three pointer from the right wing and Williams put back his own miss to make it 38-33 SJB in the early going, but the Cougars could not build on their lead and another Barnes three pointer from the top tied it at 42 at the 5 minute mark of the third quarter. Dan Nwalor scored from underneath to give the Bruins the lead, and the run continued with another three pointer by Barnes, a basket from underneath by Nosworthy, and a putback by Nwalor that made it 53-42 Baldwin with 2:06Â left in the quarter. Back to back baseline jumpers by Eric Torrens and Barnes cut it to 53-46 as the quarter wound down and that was the score at the buzzer. Williams scored from underneath to opened the final quarter, bringing SJB within 5, and a Ginyard three pointer from straight on brought them within 3 with 5:34 to play in regulation, but is was back and forth until Marvin Chartlelainâs two free throws made it 62-57 Baldwin with just 35 seconds left to play. Sinclair spun off a defender, scored and drew the foul at the 28 second mark, and his free throw brought the Cougars back within 2, but Barnes was steady at the foul lineÂ and put the Bruins up 4 on two free throws with 27 seconds left. Ginyard nailed a huge three from the top to make it a 1 point game with 20 seconds to play, and then he stole the inbound pass and was fouled going up with 17 seconds left. He made the first free throw to tie it, but missed the second to set up the overtime. Ginyard opened the overtime with a drive down the right baseline to give SJB the lead, but Richardsonâs three pointer from the top and Nosworthyâs three point play and the Bruins had the lead for good. Barnes added to it, getting fouled on a three point attempt and knocking down all three free throws for a 73-66 lead with 1:15 to play, and then Richardsonâs two free throws with less than a minute leftÂ and Baldwin was in command. 12/21 12/17 Highlights Ward Melville Shocks #4 Brentwood The Patriots were up at the half against St. Maryâs, so it was no surprise they were giving Brentwood a battle, but this time they stayed out of second half foul trouble, and Russell Winters, Gabe Brown, and Brandon Hart led themÂ to a big 77-72 victory. #3 Holy Trinity Rolls Past Elmont The Titians rang upÂ 42 first half points against Elmonts normally stingy defense, and were in control the whole way, winning 72-58. DETAILS SOON Uniondale Rips #16 Massapequa UniondaleÂ was the team everyone was expecting this time out,Â pulling away in the second quarter against a good Massapequa team for a 64-43 win.Â They featured a balanced attack that had four players in double figures, led by Alan McDonalds 13 points and 10 rebounds.Â  Westbury Pounds Jericho Westbury is off to a good start this season, puttingÂ together a 3-0 record, but they made aÂ statement against Jericho with a commanding 63-36 victory. The Dean brothers led the way with a combined 31 points,Â Shakel Kafield had 11 points, and Brian NewellÂ 9 points and 13 rebounds. St. Marys Rallies Past WM They trailed at the half, but Steve Milhaven scoredÂ 13 third quarter points to putÂ St. MarysÂ in front, and then he, Patrick Jackson, and Chris Coalman combined forÂ 21 fourth quarter pointsÂ to put Ward Melville way 76-59.

In the nightcap, Dream Nation turned back the NYC Jazz to win the Varsity Championship.Â  Brentwood Sinks Nazareth With injuries to key players and a tough early season schedule, it looked like BrentwoodÂ would struggle to maintainÂ its spot near the top of the Sweet 16Â rankingsÂ afterÂ suffering two early season losses. Instead,Â the Indians picked up a big 51-41 win over defending CHSAA Class A State Champion Nazareth at the 2013 SJB Holiday Festival, reaffirming their status as one of the top teams in New York State. There was great defensive intensity on both sides and the game got off to a slow start on the scoreboard, with the first basket coming at the 4:35 mark of the first quarter, but Mike Almonacyâs putback touched off a 7-0 Brentwood run, capped off by an Almonacy three pointer, and it was a 7-2 at the first quarter buzzer. Kameron Works opened the second quarter scoring with a putback for the Indians, but Nazareth settled in and the teams traded baskets until an alley-oop dunk by Samson Usilo, his second of the game, brought the Kingsmen within 3, and then his fast break basket off a turnover cut it to 15-14 with under 2 minutes to play in the half. Ammad Alkhulaidi followed him with a basket from underneath to give Nazareth their first lead, but Almonacy recaptured it with a runner, and he added a free throw to complete a three point play and make it 18-16 Brentwood at intermission. Usilo opened the second half with a one man run, dunking on the break, converting a three point play, and draining a three pointer from the left wing to give the Kingsmen a quick 24-18 lead, but Ali Mableton broke the run with an aggressive drive that resulted in two free throws, and a three pointer by Works at the 4:12 mark and Brentwood was back within 1. Works knocked down two free throws for a 1 point lead with 2:45 left in the quarter, but two free throws by Alkhulaidi and a steal and fastbreak basket by Usilo and Nazareth had it back again, leading 30-27. A three pointer from the right baseline by Jamel Allen as time wound down tied it at 30 with three quarters complete. Mableton opened the fourth quarter with a three pointer, and his putback made it 35-30 Brentwood with 5:10 to play. After a scramble for a loose ball, Allen found himself alone under the basket andÂ dunked for a 7 point Brentwood lead, but Dante Pulidoâs three point play brought Nazareth back within 4 with 4:01 on the clock, and a three point play by Tishsean Emmanuel and Brentwood was clinging to a 40-39 lead with 3:33 remaining. Nazareth had two chances to take the lead, but squandered back to back trips to the foul line, and Brentwood took advantage, with Mableton scoring off a well run press break to put the Indians up 42-39 with 1:47 showing.

Brown put Elmont back on top with two one and one free throws, and Nwanko added two more to make it 59-54 with 4:06 to play, but Pierre kept it close with a tough putback for Deer Park.

Regular readers know that Long Island boys varsity teams have dominated theÂ series with New York City for many years, but this year it looked like NYC might give us a run for our money, taking an early 6-3 lead in the intersectional rivalry.

It is the highest honor for a coach or player.â? Congratulations Joe! Friars Catch St. Francis #12 St. Anthonys rallied past St. Francis, one of NYCs top ranked teams, for a 62-55 victory. St. Francis came into the game with a 10-1 record, was ranked as high as 5th in the city in one poll, andÂ beat Holy Trinity by 13 earlier in the season, but it was evident that St. Anthonyâs was ready to play right from the opening tip, with Trey Kinard drilling a three pointer from the left wing to give them a quick lead. Connor Bacci answered with a three and Shane Herrity scored off a fast break basket to put St. Francis on top, and the Terriers held the lead most of the first half, going up by as many as 9 on another three pointer by Bacci and a steal and pull-up jumper by Herrity, but the Friars repeatedly took advantage of their decisive high advantage to stay within range, keeping the margin at 8 after one quarter, 6 at the half, and 6 with three quarters in the books. Kinard opened the fourth quarter with a fast break basket to bring St. Anthonyâs within 4, but Jeriah Shambley responded with a baseline jumper, Herrity added a free throw, and Jordan Santiago scored from underneath to give St. Francis a 52-43 lead with 5:46 to play. It was all Friars after that, closing out the game on an impressive 19-3 run, with Brian Dolce knocking down two free throws to start it, Mike Reinertsen drilling two big threes, one deep from the top, Dolce scoring off an alley-oop dunk, and Chris Kelly knocking down two more free throws to tie it at 54 with 2:13 to play. Dolceâs free throw then gave the Friars their first lead since early in the game, Tom Dennis banked one off the glass from underneath, and Kelly stole the ball, scored and drew a foul, and his free throw made it 60-54 Friars with 1:33 remaining. A big block by Dolce on what looked like a breakaway basket iced theÂ important 62-55 win. 1/6 CI Takes Down Hills East For the the second year in a row, Central Islip picked up a signature winÂ over an undefeated and highly ranked opponent in the month of January, beating third ranked Hills East 68-64 in aÂ League 2 heavyweight matchup. Last January, they beat eventual Suffolk County and Long Island Champion Northport in another hard fought league contest. Hills East got off to a good start on their home court, going up 14-6 on a three point play by Justin Fackler and a three pointer by Matt Boyd, but CI responded with a putback by Malcolm Pridgeon and back to back baskets by David McKenzie to draw within 2 as the quarter wound down. A putback by Jordan McRae made it 16-12 East at the first quarter buzzer. Brandon Hodge opened the second quarter with a three pointer from the right wing that cut the lead to one, Pridgeonâs putback put Central Islip in front, and then Donovan Slaterâs three pointer from the left wing made it 20-16 CI, but Fackler broke the run with three out of four free throws on consecutive trips to the line, and then McRae put the Thunderbirds back on top with a jumper from just behind the foul line with less than four minutes to play in the half. McKenzie stole the ball and scored and Armani McDaniel scored a fast break basket off a turnover for a 3 point CI lead at the 2:21 mark of the half, and then Hodge added a three pointer and McDaniel a running hook shot for a 29-21 advantage at halftime. Justyn Gilmore put back a missed shot to open the second half scoring, giving the Musketeers a 10 point lead, but a leaner by Mike Simon from the right baseline and back to back baskets off turnovers by Boyd and McRae kept East within striking distance. Hodge answered with a three from the top to bump the CI lead to 36-30, but Grant Rosenbergs elbow jumper and then his three pointer from the right baseline completed a Hills East rally that tied it 44 with 1:22 to play in the quarter. Trailing by 1 after a Simon three pointer, CI retook the lead on a three by Devon Solomon from the deep left wing just before the third quarter buzzer. Hills East moved in front once again on Boydâs three pointer from behind the left elbow as the fourth quarter began, and Fackler followed him with a basket to make it 52-49 T-Birds, but the Musketeers rallied, moving on top on McKenzieâs three pointer with 4:37 left, and going up 63-55 on Pridgeonâs putback, Solomonâs basket from underneath, and a McKenzie drive. It looked like CI would put the game away, building a 10 point lead with 43 seconds left despite hitting only 4 out 8 free throws, but they continued to struggle from the line in the games final seconds,Â while Hills East came alive and almost pulled off a miracle comeback. Rosenberg stole the ball and scored, Luke Perlowski scored from underneath off a turnover, and after a 5 second call, Simon drained a three from the top with 8 seconds leftÂ and it was a 3 point game.Â They fouled McKenzie with 7 seconds to play, andÂ needed him to miss both shots for a chance to complete the comeback, but he went 1-2 to make it a two possession game and ice the win. 1/14 1/7 Highlights TitansÂ Rally past St. Anthonys Trailing 45-41, #3 Holy Trinity closed out the game on a 13-3 run to pick up a big 54-48 league win over the Friars.

Valley Stream South Contender Valley Stream South finds itself undefeated and alone in first place in Conference A3 after defeating Floral Park 68-60. Westbury Remains Unbeaten In a conference A1 match up Westbury defeated Garden City 67 to 44. The green dragons were led by Malachi Dean who scored 19 points and had 12 rebounds and Shakel Cafield who scored 19 points. Brian Newell chipped in with 9 points and 9 rebounds. Westbury is now 4 and 0 in conference and 6 and 0 overall. ElmontÂ Stops Floral Park 15th ranked Floral Park mounted a 4th quarter rally that cut the Trojan lead to 3, but #10 Elmont pulled away down the stretch behind 3 big steals by Tristan Brown for an impressive 60-50 road victory. It was 22-19 Floral Park at the half, but Elmont narrowed the gap and took a 30-28 lead on two free throws by Matthew Graham with 4:17 to go in the third quarter. That touched off a 17-5 Trojan run featuring a nice runner by Brett Walker, three free throws by Graham, two baskets by Chazam Nwankwa, and they capped it off with back to back baskets by Brown that putÂ Elmont on top 47-33 at the third quarter buzzer. Kevin Cluess opened the fourth quarter with a drive down the right side of the lane and Jimmy Guerriero added a fast break basket to bring Floral Park back within 10, but the comeback didnât begin in earnest until a three point play by Cleuss made it an 8 point game with 3:32 to play. Mitch Calandraâs three pointer off an inbound play and a coast to coast basket by Cleuss cut the Elmont lead to 3 with 2:12 remaining, but Brown responded with a runner, and after a Floral Park free throw, he stole the ball and scored to give the Trojans a 6 point lead with less than a minute on the game clock. Brown stole the ball again and scored on the next possession, and again on the next to give Elmont a 60-50 lead with 20 seconds left and it was all over. 1/2 Titans Survive Bruin Rally In one of the Holiday Seasonâs most anticipated matchups, #4 Baldwin cut a 21 point third quarter defict to 1, but #8 Holy Trinity dug in and held on for a nail biting 65-63 victory. Holy Trinity grabbed an early 6-2 lead on two agressive drives by Jack Sixsmith, one off a steal, but Baldwin kept pace and eventually took the lead when Paul Nosworthy backed in and scored from the low post and Sidney Pigott knocked down a three from the left wing to make it 14-13 Bruins with 1:11 left in the opening quarter. The Titans retook the lead on a right elbow jumper by Bradley Eugene, giving them a one point advantage at the first quarter buzzer, and then Eugene opened the second quarter scoring with two free throws and Brandon Thompson added a putback and a coast to coast basket to make it 21-14 Holy Trinity with 6:44 to play in the half. Baldwin continued to answer, drawing within 3 on a baseline drive by DâMarco Barnes, but a steal and basket by Jack Sixsmith at the 1:25 mark gave the Titans an 8 point lead, and then Mike Farella zig-zagged through the defense and scored and Sixsmith went coast to coast to through traffic and scored to give Holy Trinity a 36-24 lead at intermission. Barnes opened the second half with a three pointer from the top to cut the Titan lead to 9, but Jimmy Golaszewski answered with a drive, and then he followed it with a three pointer from the left baseline and Farella with another three, his from the right wing, to make it 44-27 Holy Trinity with 5:04 remaining in the third quarter. Back to back baskets by Thompson gave the Titans their biggest lead - 21 points - with 1:03 to play in the quarter, and they were up 54-34 as the fourth quarter got underway. Shane Gatling opened the final quarter with a three pointer from right baseline, bringing Baldwin with 17, and two free throws by Gatling and back to back baskets by Paul Colson cut it to 57-46 with 5:03 left to play. Another three by Gatling and the home crowd was feeling it, their Bruins now within 8 with 4:29 showing, and then a big three point play by Nosworthy and a clutch three pointer by Colson and it was a 1 point game with 3:11 remaining. Holy Trinity continued to struggle offensively, with shot after shot rolling off the rim, but with the game on the line, Thompson stepped up for them, draining a huge three pointer from the top to give them a 60-56 lead. Baldwin kept coming, with Colson answering with a three to bring them back within 1 as the clock dipped below the two minute mark, but Peter Alkins was the next one to step up for Holy Trinity, bumping the lead back to 4 with an even bigger three from the right baseline. The Titanâs shooting woes spread to the free throw line however, leaving the door open, but the Bruins could not capitalize until Richardsen went coast to coast to make it a 2 point game with 21 seconds on the clock. Once again someone stepped up for Holy Trinty, this time Farella, who iced it with two pressure packed free throws and 12 seconds showing. 12/28 12/13 Highlights Hills East Catches Connetquot Connetquot started to get some Sweet 16 votes after winning convincingly in their first two games, and they showed they belonged in the discussion, giving #8 Hills East all they could handle before falling 60-54.

It looked like it was going to be a good match-up at the start, with Deer Park holding an 18-16 lead after one quarter, and it continued that way early in the second quarter, with a three pointer by Terry Harris bringing Hills West within 2, but two free throws by Karon Blackwell touched off a blistering 22-3 Deer Park run and the game was over by halftime. Highlights of the run included a nice baseline cut and basket by Kahwahn Nipper, a fast break basket by Blackwell, two baskets by Angelo Riley, and two by Aaren Edmead, who nailed an elbow jumper and then barreled through the defense and scored to make it 45-22. The game was never in doubt after that. 1/6 Holy Trinity Bounces Back Fresh off a tough road loss at St. Maryâs, #3 Holy Trinity bounced back at home in impressive fashion, handing #9 Lawrence their first loss of the season 76-67. The Golden Tornadoes looked very tentative at the start, and the Titans took advantage, jumping out to a quick 5-0 lead on a three pointer by Brandon Thomson and a drive and reverse layup by Peter Alkins, but the Dalers finally settled in, cutting the lead to 8-6 on a drive by Hamed Shamseldin, and then his three point play cut it to 10-9 with 3:52 left in the first quarter. The Holy Trinity lead was back to 5 after a steal and reverse layup by Jack Sixsmith, but Dwayne Danielâs breakaway basket made it a 3 point game at the first quarter buzzer. Thomson opened up the second quarter with a three pointer from the left wing, and he followed it with a three from the top for a 22-13 Titan lead, but a baseline drive by Shamseldin kept the margin in single digits, his second straight basket brought the Tornadoes back within 5, and then a putback by Daniel cut it to 22-19 and Holy Trinity called time. Coming out of the time-out, Bradley Eugeneâs jump hook from the lane ended the run, but Lawrence kept coming, tieing the game on a basket by Jenkins from underneath and a three point play by Josh McElveen with 4:16 to play in the half. Billy Sixsmith responded, coming off a screen and nailing a three to retake the lead, and after McElveen answered with a basket, Sixsmithâs second three pointer made it 30-26 Titans and his third, from deep behind the arc, put them up by 7 as the clock dipped under the two minute mark. He continued his one man onslaught, stealing the ball and scoring, and then Jimmy Golaszewski put back a miss to make it 37-26 Holy Trinity as halftime approached. Lawrence needed a basket and Shamseldin answered with a big three from the right wing, cutting the Titan lead to 8 at intermission. Marcus Saint-Furcyâs runner cut it to 37-31 as the second half got underway, but a basket from underneath by Golaszewski and a rare 4 point play by Alkins made it 43-31 Holy Trinity. The Titans continued to build their lead, going up 16 on free throws by Jack Sixsmith and Thomson, but the Tornadoes would not let it get out of hand, and Jymeek Jenkinsâ three from the left wing and Danielâs steal and basket at the 4:21 mark of the quarter brought them back within 8. Shamseldinâs three point play cut it to 52-45, but Billy Sixsmith put Holy Trinity up by 10 with a three from the left baseline, and after a Lawrence basket, he hit another three for a 62-51 margin with three quarters in the books. Another deep three by Sixsmith had Lawrence on the ropes as the fourth quarter got underway, putting them in a 14 point hole, but the Tornadoes answered with a run, and Saint-Furcys coast to coast basket and a pull-up jumper by Daniel cut it to 65-58 with just over four minutes to play. Lawrence could not sustain the momentum however, and free throws by Thomson and Jack Sixsmith gave the Titans a 72-61 lead with 1:45 remaining. The Tornadoes did make one last push, with Daniel nailing a jumper and then draining a three from the top to bring them within 6 with 1:18 to play, but they could not find the basket down the stretch and would get no closer. 1/11 1/11/Highlights Three Unbeaten Teams Left! Farmingdale rallied past Uniondale 41-39 to remain unbeaten (see story), and Westbury stayed perfect with a hard fought 62-58 win over Carey (see story), but Lawrence fell to Holy Trinity 76-67 (story soon), leaving only Farmingdale, Westbury, and Hills East without a loss this season.

Amityville Rocks Baldwin Amityville has been locked into the #2 slot of our Sweet 16 Coaches Poll all season, and they showed why at their Nassau/Suffolk Challenge matchup with #7 Baldwin, running up a big lead against a very good Bruins team before holding off a late rally for an impressiveÂ 73-64 win. People had been talking about this game for weeks, and it the was the last game of the day at the Nassau/Suffolk Challenge, so there was great anticipation before the tip-off. Amityville got off to a fast start, answering Dan Nwalorâs putback with a fade away runner by Mike Smith, and quickly building an 11-2 lead on a nice fake and spin move to the basket by Malcolm Mathis, a putback of a missed free throw by Leland Williams, and a well executed duck-under move by Smith. Travis Dickerson converted a three point play to make it 14-2 Warriors, but Shane Gatling broke the run for Baldwin with a much needed three pointer from the baseline to bring the lead back into single digits. Smith answered emphatically, draining back to back threes, and then Sean Walters scored a fast break basket to make it 20-5 Amityville with 2:24 still to play in the opening quarter, but just when it began to look like things were getting out of hand, Baldwin responded with a 7-2 run,Â getting a putback by Marvin Chartlelain, a short pull-up jumper by Myking Richardson, and a fast break basket by Chartlelain to bring them back within 10.Â  Amityville retook the momentum, closing out the quarter on a run of their own to go up 27-12 off a Leyland William fast break basket, and that was the score as the first quarter came to a close. Richardson opened the second quarter with a basket from underneath for Baldwin, and a three pointer by DMarco Barnes and two free throws by Richardson brought the Bruins within 9 mid way through the quarter, but Amityville rebuilt their lead as the quarter wound down, going up 44-25 at the halftime buzzer on back to back baskets by Dickerson. Dickerson opened the second half with an elbow jumper, and a three pointer by Walters from the top gave the Warriors a 24 point lead, but Gatlingâs athletic drive touched off another Baldwin run, and the Bruins were back within 12 on a drive by Richardson and a three pointer by Daraja Rodwell. Dickerson ended the run with another elbow jumper, and it was 57-44 at the quarter on a press break basket by Smith. Richardson got things going in the fourth quarter with a runner for Baldwin, but Elijah Rogers answered with a three pointer from the right wing, Williams knocked down two free throws, and Mathis scored on a spinning drive, drawing a foul and knocking down the free throw to make it 65-48 Amityville with 4:52 to play. Baldwin made one last run, with a putback by Richardson and a three pointer by Barnes from the top cutting it to 70-60 with 2:06 left, but with an opportunity to cut the lead to single digits, they missed the front end of a one and one and Dickerson went coast to coast and converted a three point play for a 13 point Warrior lead with 1:08 on the game clock. The Bruins shaved a few more points off the lead, but never seriouly threatened the rest of the way.Â 1/19 Dalers Nip Knights In a physical, testy game between two rivals, Farmingdale came from behind to top Uniondale, 41-39. Playing on its home court, the Dalers jumped ahead to a 4-1 lead behind strong inside scoring from Ronald Winkler. When Farmingdale went to its bench, the Knights took advantage as Justin Thomas scored 5 points to give Uniondale a 7-6 lead at the end of the first quarter. Uniondale turned up the defensive intensity to start the second quarter and went on a 10-0 run as Alan McDonald and Najee Peters dominated in the post and on the glass. Winkler reestablished himself at the end of the second to bring Farmingdale back into the game and the Dalers trailed 20-12 at the half. With his team trailing 23-15 and 4 and a half minutes left in the third quarter, Farmingdaleâs Curtis Jenkins got tied up with Uniondaleâs Imran Richie, fighting for a loose ball. Even though the referees called a jump ball, giving Farmindale possession, the two players continued to wrestle for the ball and the situation erupted into a near-brawl, with players leaving both benches. After a five-minute stoppage of play, the referees assessed technical fouls on both sides, the majority to Uniondale for having more players leave the bench, and the net result was ten additional free throws for Farmingdale. They hit 5 of 10 to pull within 3, 23-20. Within minutes, the referees called a technical on Shomari Redd after he disputed a foul call and Farmingdaleâs Jack Burke hit both free throws to bring the score to 23-22. The teams traded baskets through the fourth quarter until Uniondale pulled ahead 39-33 with four minutes remaining, but after both McDonald and Peters fouled out, the Knights seemed to have no answer for Jenkins. He scored his teamâs last six points, including a driving layup that tied the game at 39. After Jenkins missed the and 1 free throw, Winkler grabbed the rebound and Farmingdale called time out. The Dalers drew up an isolation play for Jenkins, who hit a contested, running jump shot in the lane with three second remaining to give his team a two-point lead. Uniondaleâs half-court attempt at the buzzer just missed, and the Dalers emerged with a hard-fought victory. Jenkins scored 10 of his game-high 15 points in the fourth quarter. Richie led Uniondale with 9. 1/11 âThere comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.â? John Glenn Clips BBP Two teams fighting it out for second place in Suffolk League 6 and for higher playoff seeds faced off at John Glenn High School, and the host Knights prevailed, defeating Bayport/Blue Point 52-49 on a three pointer by KeAndre Augustine with 3.7 seconds remaining. Both teams battled first place Amityville down to the wire in recent games, so a tight, competitive game game was expected and thatâs exactly how it played out. Paul Wesnofske opened the scoring with a nice cut down the baseline, but the Phantoms answered quickly on a fast break basket by Connor Panzner. Augustine made his presence known early on, drilling a three pointer from straight on, and after Panzer responded with a three from the top, he knocked down two more threes and Darryl Daniels followed with another three, a three point play and a putback for a 19-11 John Glenn lead. Panzner kept Bayport within range on a three point play of his own, scoring from the lane and converting the free throw, and then Mike Walkerâs three pointer from the left wing brought the Phantoms back within 4 as the first quarter came to a close. A Bayport free throw opened the second quarter scoring, and Panzner added a three pointer from the right wing to tie it at 21, but Augustine answered with back to back drives for a 25-21 Knights lead with 3:21 to play in the half. Panzner tied it again with back to back fast break baskets, but an acrobatic three point play by Augustine gave Glenn a 30-28 lead at intermission. Tyler Grosse scored from underneath and then again on the break to put Bayport on top 32-30 as the third quarter got underway, but the Knights retook the lead on a three pointer by Wayne White from the left wing, and then his three from straight on made it 37-35 Glenn with 4:48 to play in the quarter. Panzner tied it at 37 with drive at the 3:39 mark, and again at 40 with a spinning drive and free throw, but 2 out of 4 Glenn free throws in the final seconds gave them the lead heading into the final quarter. Jeff Park tipped in his own miss to put Glenn up by 4 as the fourth quarter got underway, and Wesnofskeâs three pointer from the left baseline made it 47-40 in the early going, but drives by Matt McKinnon and Panzner narrowed the gap, and then a steal and basket by Panzner with 2:27 to play brought Bayport back within 1. It was 49 all after a Bayport free throw with 1:22 remaining, but both teams came up empty as the clock ticked down, and with time out on the floor, it was Glenn ball with 10 seconds to play. Coming out of the time out, the Knights worked the ball around to Augustine, who drained the game winner from the right baseline.Â 1/24 ASK THE REF! Kicked Ball!

Kennedy, a CHSAA Class A school from Somers, NY, got on the scoreboard quickly, with Sean Delaney knocking down two free throws and then scoring a fast break basket, and Dominick Cristiano scoring off an inbound play and adding two free throws for an 8-0 lead, but the Firebirds answered with 8 straight of their own, with Mike Torre scoring back to back from close range, Kyle Quinn draining a short twisting jumper, and Kyle De Verna driving the baseline to tie it. Cristianoâs foul line jumper put the Gaels back on top, but it was 11-10 Kellenberg at the first quarter buzzer on a three point play by De Verna. De Verna and Steve Torre scored back to back fast break baskets for Kellenberg to open the second quarter, but the Firebirds could not build on their lead, instead trading baskets and free throws with Kennedy right to the break and taking a 26-21 lead into the halftime locker room. Kevin Buron put back his own miss to open the third quarter, bringing the Gaels back within three, but a three point play and then an elbow jumper by Ryan Durney and two free throws by Quinn gave Kellenberg its biggest lead at 33-23. Delaneyâs short jumper broke the run and ignited a 13-2 Kennedy run, with Delaneyâs fast break runner cutting the lead to 3 with 2:16 remaining, Cristianoâs putback making it a 1 point game, and a pull-up jumper by Delaney tying it at 35. A free throw just before the buzzer capped off the run and gave the Gaels a 36-35 lead heading into the 4th. Alex Bensonâs steal and fastbreak basket gave Kennedy a 3 point lead as the fourth quarter got underway, and Delaneyâs drive, a three point play by Buron, and two free throws by Benson made it 45-37 with 5:24 to play. Poor free throw shooting was plaguing the Firebirds, but a much needed basket by Steve Torre kept it close, and two free throws by Quinn brought Kellenberg back within 5. After another 1 for 2 at the line brought Kellenberg within 4, Delaney answered with a baseline jumper for a 48-42 Kennedy lead with 2:11 left, but Quinn scored on back to back drives and the Firebirds were back within 2 with 1:35 to play. They had a chance to tie with 1:19 showing, but continued to struggle at the line, going 1 for 2 and still trailed by 1. Kennedy was also struggling at the stripe, and went 2-4 down the stretch to takeÂ a 3 point lead and leave the door open with 40 seconds left, but Quinn was fouled before he could get off a three pointer, and his two free throws cut the margin to 1. Cristiano was fouled on the other end and made both shots with 15 seconds left, and then Kellenberg came down with a chance to tie, but missed a three point attempt.Â Mike Torre rebounded the miss and was fouled withÂ 3 seconds to play, andÂ both his shot fell toÂ bring the deficit back to 1. A quick foul followed and resulted in one more Kennedy free throw, and trailing by 2, a desperation Firebird shot at the buzzer was close but missed the mark. 1/25 D1 College Update Stony Brook improved to 5-0 in the America East with an 82-61 win over UMBCÂ  STORY Â  Port Washingtons Ahmad Walker had 8 points and 7 reboundsâ¦..

FlyersÂ Hold Off Patriots Chaminade led almost wire to wire, holding on to defeat #11 Ward Melville 52-50 in the first game of the annualÂ Tom Crotty Classic. The Patriots looked very tight at the start, air-balling many of their shots while Chaminade quickly built a lead. James McCullagh got things started for the Flyers with a nice hook shot from the lane, and then Tom OConnell and Brendan Quinn nailed back to back three pointers and OâConnell knocked down his second three for an 11-2 advantage. The barrage continued with Oâs third three putting Chaminade up by 10 with 3:30 remaining in the opening quarter, and Sean Clark looped one in from the lane to make it 16-4 at the buzzer. Andre Audige decided to take things into his own hands as the second quarter got underway, sparking Ward Melville with back to back baskets to cut the deficit to single digits, and then two free throws by Russell Winters and a three by Audige and it was suddenly a 3 point game. Audigeâs runner from the right wing cut it to 18-17 before Anthony Gunther responded with back to back baskets from the lane, but as the seconds ticked down in the half, it was back to a 1 point game on a coast to coast basket by Winters that left Chaminade clinging to a 23-22 halftime lead. The third quarter was all Chaminade. OâConnell opened the scoring with a jumper from behind the right elbow for a 3 point Flyer lead, and after a free throw, McCullagh added a short drive to make it 28-22. It was 36-26 on a three pointer and fast break basket by Dan Gonyon, and Sal Fradella and OâConnell capped it off with back to back threes to make it 44-29 Flyers with three quarters in the books. Audige once again led the Ward Melville comeback, stealing the ball and scoring to open up the fourth quarter, and Gabe Brown added back to back putbacks and a free throw to bring the PatriotsÂ within 8. OâConnell broke the run with two free throws, but Brandon Hart came off a screen and knocked down a three and then followed it with another three to cut it to 46-42 with 3:15 to play. A Winters drive made it a 2 point game at the 2:35 mark, but OâConnell responded with a tough drive to make it 49-44 Chaminade with 1:05 to play, and then Gunther knocked down three out of four free throws to make it 52-44 with 20 seconds left. Ward Melville did not let up, but back to back threes by Hart and Audige in the final seconds were too little too late. 1/25 KINGS OF THE COURT!

Upper Room was inspired, battling Our Savior New American up to halftime, where they trailed 34-26, before the Pioneers threw it into high gear and pulled away for an impressive 81-54 victory. Upper Room took a 7-6 lead in the early going on a pull-up jumper by John Campbell, but Michael Nzei answered with a jumper from the top to retake the lead, and then after an exchange of baskets, John Oliver knocked down a three pointer from the left wing and then looped in a shot from the baseline to make it 15-10 OSNA with 40 seconds to play in opening quarter.

VSCâs Eriq Williams opened the scoring with a jumper from the left elbow, but Baldwinâs Shane Gatling answered with a three pointer and Jared Bradford added two free throws for a 5-2 Bruin lead, a lead they would never relinquish. Gatlingâs three pointer from the left wing made it 12-5 Baldwin at just over the 5 minute mark of the quarter, but a putback by Andre Garroway and a nice turnaround jumper by Williams from the right elbow brought the Eagles back within 3. Gatlingâs third three pointer and a putback by Paul Nosworthy bumped the lead to 20-14, and a three by DMarco Barnes from behind the elbow made it 25-16 Bruins as the first quarter came to a close. Gatling continued his red hot shooting, knocking down another three to open the second quarter, but Winston Jones answered with a three for Valley Stream. Gatling was fouled attempting a three and hit all three free throws and then Nosworthy powered up from underneath to make it 33-24 Baldwin with 4:22 to play in the half, butÂ Williams answered with a nice drive from the foul line.Â Gatling knocked down yet another three for a 10 point Bruin lead and it was 39-30 Baldwin at the half.

A fast break basket and free throw by Richburg with 1:52 on the clock cut it to 71-63, and then a steal, basket, and free throw by Garroway made it a 5 point game, but the Eagles could not find the basket down the stretch, and Gatling went 8 out of 10 from the foul line to ice it.Â 1/31 LI vs NYC There is a great canât miss intersectional matchup youâll want to catch on Wednesday, February 5th when NYCâs #1 ranked team, unbeaten Cardinal Hayes, takes on Long Islandâs #1 team, Long Island Lutheran, at LuHi in Brookville.

Brentwood Gets Revenge Brentwoods only league loss was to Ward Melville, and they avenged it, pulling away for a 68-54 win over the Patriots in the rematch at Brentwood. The game had been pushed back by a snowstorm, creating even more than the usual anticipation before a game between first and second place teams, so it was not surprising that the teams tipped off in front of a big crowd and the game was played with playoff intensity throughout. Brentwood star Femi Olujobi, back from the injury list and working his way into game shape, opened the scoring with a nice duck-under move, and then super soph Michael Almonacy stole the ball and scored for a quick 4-0 lead. Almonacyâs three from straight on and Olujobiâs turn-around jumper from the left elbow made it 11-4 Brentwood with just under 3 minutes to play in the opening quarter, and the teams traded baskets the rest of the way, with Brandon Hartâs three pointer for Ward Melville cutting it to 13-9 and Ali Mabletonâs two free throws giving the Indians a 6 point lead at the first quarter buzzer. Vincent Smythe opened the second quarter with a putback to put Brentwood on top 17-9, but back to back baskets by Brian Winters and a steal and basket by Andre Audige cut it to 19-17, and then a three by Hart from the right wing made it a 1 point games with 2:26 to play in the half. Winters went coast to coast to tie it at 23 with 18 seconds left on the game clock, and thatâs the way the half ended. Gabe Brownâs three point play gave the Patriots a 26-23 lead as the third quarter got underway, but a foul line jumper by Olujobi and a looping shot from the baseline by Mableton put Brentwood back on top, and after the teams took turns at the foul line, Olujobi nailed a three from the top and Allen went hard to the basket and scored to put Brentwood up 36-29 with 3:23 left in the third quarter. Audige ignited a Ward Melville rally in the closing minutes, scoring on a fast break basket, and then Winters knocked down two free throws and Hart went coast to coast to bring the Patriots within 2 with less than a minute remaining in the quarter, but they gave it all back in the finals seconds on a tough fall-away jumper by Almonacy from the right elbow, his drive down the lane, and a foul call right at the buzzer that sent Mableton to the line. His two free throws gave the Indians a 43-35 lead with three quarters complete. Almonacy opened the fourth quarter with back to back three pointers for a 14 point Brentwood lead, and his third three was the beginning of the end for Ward Melville, putting them in a 54-37 hole with 5:03 to play. The Patriots needed scores and stops down the stretch, but instead traded baskets and free throws and never got closer than 11 the rest of the way. 2/1 2/1 Highlights Deer Park No Match For LuHi #1 ranked Long Island Lutheran picked up an impressiveÂ road win, going into Deer Park, always a tough place to play, and rolling over the the 10th ranked Falcons 65-44 Westbury Holds Off Friends A non-league game between two teams with only one loss, and itÂ was a good one, with the Green Dragons holding off Friends Academy 64-61.

Westbury Holds Off Friends This was a non-league game between two teams with only one loss, and it was a good one, with the Westbury holding off Friends Academy 64-61. Westbury jumped out to a quick 10-2 lead on back to back baskets by Shakel Cafield, the first a three pointer from the left wing, and the second a runner from the lane, but Friends narrowed the gap as the quarter wound down, drawing within 1 at the first quarter buzzer on a jumper by Thomas Frey and an alley-oop basket by Cyrus Holder off an inbound play. Freyâs spinning baseline drive put the Quakers up 13-12 as the second quarter got underway, but the Green Dragons moved back in front on Christian Hamiltonâs two free throws and a three pointer by Jonathan Dean from the right wing. Frey answered with a three from the top to cut the margin to 1, but a drive by Hamilton, a three by Cafield from the left baseline, and a steal and fastbreak basket by Hamilton and Westbury was up 24-16 with 5:25 to play in the half. Back to back threes by Jerome Cunningham pushed the lead to 32-20, and Jonathan Dean spun out of the low post and scored for a 14 point lead with 1:45 to play in the half, but a three by Tyrone Perkins from the right baseline kept things from getting out of hand and it was 36-25 Westbury at halftime. Friends opened the second half with a run, pulling within 1 on another three pointer by Perkins from the deep left wing, but Hamilton stopped it with a three from the deep right wing. The Quakers continued to close in, drawing even on Jon Nierenbergâs fast break basket at the 2 minute mark of the quarter, and they took a 50-48 lead on 2 free throws by Perkins at the third quarter buzzer. Westbury retook the lead on a putback by Dean early in the fourth quarter, and then his three pointer and putbacks by Brian Newell, Cafield, and Malachi Dean made it 63-52 Green Dragons with 1:49 to play. Friends needed a big basket to stay in it, and Perkins responded with a three from the right wing at the 1:31 mark, and then his putback cut it to 63-57 with just under a minute to play. A big steal and basket by Friends was nullified by a charging call, but Westbury turned it over again and Perkins scored a fast break basket to make it 63-59 with 23 seconds left. Another Green Dragon turnover and foul sent Nierenberg to the line for Friends, and he came up short, seemingly dooming the Quakers, but Holder rebounded his missed second free throw and scored to make it a 2 point game with 10.5 seconds showing on the game clock. A foul sent Cafield to the line for Westbury, shooting 1 and 1 with 7.9 seconds left, and he missed, but he chased down the rebound and was fouled again with 4 seconds remaining. This time, he went 1 for 2, still leaving the door open, but a desperation shot by Friends was off the mark at the buzzer. 2/1 â1/31 Highlights SJB Upsets Holy Trinity St. John The Baptist played a brutal non-league schedule, and didnt fare well, but it looks like the Cougars came through it in one piece, pulling off their second NSCHSAA upset with a 69-64 win over fourth ranked Holy Trinity.

William Knight kept the pressure on, nailing a three for South from the right wing, but Cluess answered with a jumper and brother TJ Cluess went 3 for 4 from the line to cut it to 24-20 with 4:14 to play in the half. VSS answered with a run, starting with a putback by Dean Colbert and a fast break basket by Knight, and then after Jordan Butler tried to keep it close with a three pointer from the top, they added two free throws, a coast to coast basket, and a pull up jumper by Knight and then a three pointer by Jerami Hernandez to build a 37-23 lead and it was 39-25 at the half. The teams traded baskets and free throws until TJ Cluess knocked down a three for Floral Park to cut it to 42-33 with 5:28 remaining in the third quarter, and then he added two technical free throws to bring the Knights within 7. It was a 5 point game after Butler grabbed a loose ball and scored, Kevin Cluessâs three point play cut it to 46-42 with 3:33 left in the quarter, and TJ Cluessâs long range three pointer brought Floral Park within 2, but Dana Kingâs three pointer from the right wing and Colbertâs two free throws put VSS up by 7 and they led by 8 with three quarters complete. King stepped back and nailed a three for the Falcons from the right wing to open the fourth quarter, but Butler answered with a three from behind the left elbow. Knight gave South a 65-54 lead with a pull-up jumper from the elbow with 5:33 to play, and Colbertâs fast break basket made it 73-60 Falcons with 3:15 left.

Massapequa had the upper hand at the start, taking a 15-8 lead as the seconds ticked down in the first quarter on a putback by Sean Nealis , but Tristan Brown kept it close with a three pointer from the top just before the buzzer. Andrew Codrington Â looped down the lane and scored early in the second quarter to bring Elmont within 2, and then Brown drained a three pointer from the right wing to put the Spartans into the lead, but the Chiefs responded with a run, and Alex Cosenza s back to back three pointers gave them a 28-20 advantage with 2:43 to play in the half and that was their lead at intermission. Elmontâs Kevon Chambers Â scored on a putback to open the second half, and then a steal and basket by Brett Walker Â and another three pointer by Brown made it a 1 point game still early in the third quarter. Massapequa regrouped, and a three pointer by Dylan Balducci bumped their lead to 39-33, but the Spartans closed in again on a three by Matthew Graham Â from the baseline, and then a fast break basket byÂ Walker and a putback byÂ Chambers gave Elmont a 42-41 lead with 1:45 to play in the quarter. Balducci responded with a very deep three to retake the lead, and then two free throws by Cosenza Â made it 46-42 Massapequa, but two free throws by Chiazam Nwankwo Â and a three pointer by Keith Tompkins Â gave Elmont a 47-46 lead at the third quarter buzzer.

The Spartans turned over the ball on the next possession, giving the Chiefs another opportunity to cut the lead, but they could not sustain the momentum, and did not score again down the stretch. 2/19 Carey Upsets Lawrence For the third year in a row, Lawrence was one of the top seeds in Class A, and for the third year in a row, they were upset in an early round. This year, they came roaring from behind to send the game into overtime, but an underrated Carey team regrouped and came from in behind in OT for a 64-63 victory. Carey came ready to play right from the start and moved out to an 18-12 lead on a baseline jumper by Kieran Murchie. Hamed Shamseldin responded, scoring from underneath off a turnover, but Adrian Denner knocked down a three from behind the right elbow to make it 21-14 Seahawks with 4:50 to play in the half. Shamseldin was determined to keep it close, stealing the ball and scoring, and after Denner knocked down another three, this time from behind the left elbow, he answered again with a three from the right wing to make it a 5 point game with 3:22 left. Adrian Danielâs jumper from just outside the right elbow brought the Golden Tornadoes within 3, but Denner continued to score at will, converting a three point play. Daniel answered this time, knocking down a left wing three, but Carey finished off the half with a free throw and then a jumper by Dylan DeMeo at the buzzer and led 31-24 heading into the locker room. Denner opened the second half scoring with a pump-fake, drive and pull-up jumper to make it 33-24 Carey, and Tommy Gallantâs jumper from the lane gave the Seahawks an 11 point lead, but three out of four free throws by Jymeek Jenkins and a fast break basket by Marcus St. Furcy cut it to 35-29 at the 4:17 mark of the quarter.

DeMeoâs five straight free throws and a fast break basket by Denner made it 55-48 Seahawks with 2:20 left, but a free throw by Jenkins and a putback by Shamseldin and it was a 4 point game 1:43 to play. Daniel went coast to coast to cut it to 56-54 with 38 seconds on the game clock, and Jenkins did the same and it was all tied up with 21 seconds left, but the Seahawks could not get on the board in the final seconds and the game went into overtime.

Lawrence took the lead on a pull-up jumper and free throw by Daniel with 13 seconds left, but DeMeo drew a foul with 8 seconds to play, knocking down both shots to put Carey on top 64-63.

St. Michael 65-57 at the Upstate/Downstate Challenge. The two teams swapped the lead back and forth for most of the first quarter, with South Sideâs Alex Sorensen and Mountâs Karrell Henry trading threes to tie the game at 12 at the 3:30 mark of the quarter, but the Cyclones reeled off 6 straight points on a basket by Garret Gallego and two by Keith Phifer to take an 18-12 lead as the quarter began to wind down.

Singleton continued to attack the basket for Mount, drawing another foul and hitting both free throws, and he followed them up with a fast break runner to make it a 1 point game, but the lead went back and forth the rest of the way, and five straight points by Pace Shaw, who knocked down a three and scored a fast break basket, gave South Side a 31-29 lead at intermission. The teams continued to trade baskets and the lead deep into the third quarter, but MSM got some breathing room when Singleton knocked down a three and Kelvin Riley converted a three point play to give the Mountaineers a 46-40 lead at the 1:39 mark of the quarter. Sorensen and Riley exchanged three pointers, and then Singleton drew a foul on a three point attempt with just 1 second left, going 2 for 3 from the line to put Mount up 51-43 with three quarters in the books. Back to back baskets by Riley gave MSM a 10 point lead early in the fourth quarter, but neither team could generate any real momentum the rest of the way. South Side started to inch back into it, drawing within 7 with 3:22 to left on two free throws by Paul Pandolphi, and a Ruiz three pointer cut it to 63-57 with 1:42 remaining, but the Cyclones could get no closer and Riley added two free throws for the final 8 point margin. 2/8Â  Uniondale At The Buzzer! The much anticipated rematch between Uniondale and Farmingdale was everything that was hoped for - a great game that came down to the final seconds, and Uniondaleâs Nick Danns hit the dramatic game winner, knocking down a short jumper from just outside the lane for a 47-46 victory. The Knights were pumped up on their home court, scoring the gameâs first 12 points, with Alan McDonald opening the scoring with a fast break basket and Imran Ritchie scoring back to back, but Farmingdale weathered the storm, drawing back within 6 on three straight baskets by Curtis Jenkins, his third an emphatic steal and dunk. McDonald answered from underneath as the seconds ticked down in the opening quarter, giving Uniondale an 8 point lead at the buzzer. The Knights scored first as the second quarter got underway, adding a free throw, but the Dalers went on a run, with Jenkins knocking down a jumper from the right wing and two free throws, and then back to back threes by Rah-Quell Rogers and Danny McKeon and a runner by Rogers put Farmingdale on top 18-17 with 3:15 to play in the half. A basket by Dallas Creamer from underneath gave Farmingdale a 3 point lead with 44 seconds remaining, and then Ritchie and Rogers traded baskets to make it 22-19 Dalers at intermission. Both teams struggled at the foul line for much of the third quarter, and there were a lot of fouls called, but neither team could take advantage and it remained a tight game. Farmingdale started to build some momentum after a jump hook by Ron Winkler and a baseline jumper by Malik Seelal gave them a 6 point lead, and then back to back threes by McKeon and Seelal made it 37-27 Dalers with less than 2 minutes to play in the quarter, but McDonald would not let Farmingdale pull away, attacking the basket with great determination, drawing a foul and knocking down two free throws. After a potentially devastating three pointer by Creamer from the left baseline gave the Dalers a 40-29 lead, McDonald scored again on a putback to keep Uniondale within striking distance, and Malik Howardâs steal and basket brought the Knights within 7 as the third quarter came to a close. Â Winkler opened the fourth quarter with a jump hook from just outside the post to give Farmingdale a 9 point lead, but the teams exchanged baskets to the 1:58 mark, when two free throws by Tahreek Hodge brought the Knights within 5. McDonald scored again, this time from underneath with 1:14 remaining to cut it to 46-43, and then after a Farmingdale turnover, his drive accross the lane made it a one point game with 22 seconds left. After a timeout, Farmingdale inbounded the ball, but it was knocked loose in the backcourt, and although the Dalers regained possession, they could not get across the halfcourt line in time, and a 10 second violation was called with 11 seconds remaining. That set up the dramatic shot by Danns, a short jumper from just to the left of the lane with about 2 seconds on the clock. Farmingdaleâs desperation shot at the buzzer was off target. 2/7 2/4 Highlights Kellenberg Pops St. Maryâs The NSCHSAA race is turning into the dogfight everyone expected this season, with Kellenberg bringing St. Maryâs back to the pack with a 94-81 victory.Â  Uniondale Slams Freeport Uniondale might be peaking at just the right time, rolling over a solid Freeport team 74-46 at Freeport.Â  North Babylon Clinches North Babylon emerged from the pack to clinch Suffolk League 3 with a 61-56 win over Copiague.

A Section 9 Class AA Semifinalist last season,Â Middletown came into the Challenge having won 5 of their last 6 games, and quickly showed they were a team to be reckoned with, taking a 17-7 lead over Long IslandâsÂ 6th ranked team on a late first quarter run.Â The Bears continued to build their lead in the second quarter, with a three pointer and then a putback by Aaron Ray giving them a 26-11 advantage, but DâMarco Barnes stalled the rally with a three pointer from behind the left elbow, and two free throws by Shane Gatling brought Baldwin back within 11. Paul Nosworthyâs basket from underneath and a pull-up jumper from the left wing by Miking Richardson made it a 6 point game with 2:06 to play in the half, but Ray answered with a fast break basket to give Middletown a 34-26 lead at the break. Ray opened the second half with a fast break runner and Jonathan Holder looped one in from the baseline for a 12 point Middletown lead early in the third quarter, but Jared Bradford answered with a fast break basket, and after a Bears free throw, Gatling rattled in a three from the left baseline and the margin was 8 once again. Shandy Casimir responded with a fast break basket to push Middletownâs lead back into double digits, but Gatling drilled a deep three from the top, and Barnes followed him with a three from the left baseline to cut it to 41-37 with 3:07 to play in the quarter. A Marlon Adams reverse layup made it a 6 point game, but Gatling nailed another three from long range at the 2:20 mark, and Richardson closed out quarter with two free throws to bring Baldwin within 2 with one quarter to play. Nosworthyâs basket from the low post tied it at 46 early in the fourth quarter, and Daraja Rodwellâs jumper from the foul line put Baldwin on top with 5:08 to play, but as the clock dipped under three minutes, Middletown was back in front on a tip-in byÂ Adams. Baldwin retook the lead on a drive by Paul Colson, but Malcolm Jackson responded with a putback of his own miss, and Burton scored to make it 55-52 Middletown with 1:30 left. Gatling hit two big free throw to bring Baldwin within 1 with 1:08 remaining, and after a turnover, it was Bruin ball trailing by 1 with 36 seconds on the game clock, but they did not score and had to foul. The 1 and 1 free throw was missed, but with only 2.3 seconds showing, the Bruins could not get a good look and lost the heartbreaker. 2/8 Titans Rip Gaels It was 75-69 St. Maryâs the first time through, but Holy Trinity dominated the rematch, building a big lead and cruising to an 80-61 victory. Steve Milhavenâs three point play cut it to 6-5 early in the first quarter, but Bradley Eugene and Jack Sixsmith ignited the Titans with back to back drives, Billy Sixsmithâs three pointer from behind the left elbow made it 15-5, Jimmy Golaszewski went hard to the basket and scored for a 12 point lead, and after a Milhaven three pointer, Eugeneâs jumper from straight on, four straight free throws by Jack Sixsmith, and a reverse layup by Golaszewski made it 25-8 Holy Trinity at the first quarter buzzer. The run continued as the second quarter got underway, with Brandon Thomson draining a three from the right wing and Jack Sixsmith adding a free throw, but Nick Richards got St. Maryâs on the board with a putback and Milhaven scored from underneath to cut it to 29-12. The teams exchanged baskets and free throws the rest of the quarter, with Holy Trinity answering every rally attempt by the Gaels, and the lead was 22 after a three pointer by Thomson with 2:40 to play in the half, but Chris Coalman answered with a fast break basket and Milhaven knocked down two free throws to narrow it to 47-29 at intermission. Richards rebounded and scored to open the second half, cutting the margin to 16, but Golaszewski looped one in from the lane and Mike Farella nailed a three from the right baseline to make it 52-31 at the 5:28 mark of the quarter. It was a 23 point game after a goaltending call on a shot by Golaszewski, but St. Maryâs started to whittle away at the lead, cutting it to 54-36 on a basket by Coalman from underneath. The Titans continued to answer, this time with a trademark deep three by Billy Sixsmith from way behind the left elbow that made it 57-36 with 2:55 remaining in the quarter, and it was 62-42 with three quarters complete. Damani Myers knocked down two technical free throws to open the fourth quarter, cutting the margin to 18, and a deep three and two free throws by Milhaven brought the Gaels within 12 at 62-50. A steal and fastbreak basket by Patrick Jackson and St. Maryâs was within striking distance, trailing by 10 with 3:57 to play, but Golaszewski drove the baseline for a reverse layup and Thomson scored on the press break to make it 69-54 with 2:31 showing. Milhaven kept St. Maryâs alive with a three from the left wing, but Golaszewski answered with two free throws, Thomson added two more, and Jack Sixsmithâs two free throws made it 76-59 with 1:25 left.

Over S.I. This is the time of year when teams are battling for playoff spots and seeds, and Smithtown Christian is one of those teams. The Knights kept their playoff hopes alive with a big 64-56 win over Shelter Island, leaving them a win away from a spot in this yearâs playoffs. Corey Collins opened the scoring for Smithtown with a three pointer from the right wing on the gameâs first possession, but Shelter Island quickly answered with a 7-0 run, with Matt Belt-Cappellino knocking down a baseline jumper, Riley Willumsen a three pointer from the left wing, and Matt Dunning a reverse lay-up. Calen McCabeâs tip-in cut it to 9-5 with 5:42 still to play in the opening quarter, and then a three pointer by Charles Bellini from the top and a fast break basket by Kyle Straker brought the Knights within 1 with 2:58 to play. A foul and technical foul call against Smithtown led to four straight free throws by Tristen Wissemann and a 17-12 Shelter Island lead, but Collins drained another three in response and Straker converted a three point play to put SC on top 18-17. The Indianâs retook the lead on Weismanns basket off an inbound play, but a Collins baseline three gave Smithtown a 21-19 lead at the first quarter buzzer. Collins opened the second quarter with a fast break layup and a putback for a 6 point Knights lead, and McCabeâs two free throws made it 27-19 Smithtown, but back to back baskets by Belt-Cappellino, including a three from the left wing, made it a two point game with 3:43 to play in the half. Wissemann tied it at 28 with a nice pump fake and basket from the lane, but Smithtown closed out the half on a run, regaining the lead on a three pointer by Ron Linsalato, McCabeâs three point play off a missed free throw, and a Collins three just before the buzzer that gave them a 37-28 advantage heading into the locker room. McCabe opened the second half with a three pointer from the right wing, and Bellini followed him with a drive for a 42-28 SC lead. Two free throws and another three by McCabe and the Knights had their 19th straight point and were threatening to break it open, but after a timeout, Wissemann ended the run with a three pointer, igniting a 14-2 Shelter Island run that got them back into the game. Belt-Cappellino kept it going with a three from behind the right elbow, Dunningâs basket from underneath cut it to 49-40 at the 2:26 mark, and Willumsenâs three from behind the right elbow made it a 6 point game with less than a minute to play in the 3rd, but another big three by Collins broke the run and gave Smithtown a 52-43 lead with three quarters complete. Willumsen opened the fourth quarter scoring with a basket from underneath, and Wissemannâs three from behind the right elbow and fast break basket cut the SC lead to 2, but after a McCabe free throw, Zach DiBlandaâs basket from underneath, and another big Collins three from the left wing, it was Smithtown by 8 with 4:48 to play. Connor McCabeâs baseline drive and reverse layup made it 60-50 Knights, but Willumsenâs runner and Belt-Cappellinoâs three from the top brought Shelter Island back within 5 with 1:54 remaining. Thatâs as close as the Indians would get, however. Belliniâs big drive made it a 7 point game, and Connor McCabeâs fast break basket gave Smithtown a 64-55 lead with under a minute to play and it was a 64-56 final. 2/6 PLAYOFF BRACKETS SECTION 8 Class AA Class A Class B/C SECTION 11 Class AA Class A Class B Class C/D SUFFOLK COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS To see every playoff bracket from every region of New York state,Â  CLICK HERE ASK THE REF! Good batch of questions answered in this editon of Â  ASK THE REF! Smithtown West Advances After going 0-18 last season, Comsewogue dramaticly turned it around this season, finishing their Suffolk League 5 schedule 7-5 to qualify for the playoffs, but they drew a tough match-up in their outbracket game, and their season came to an end with a 71-57 loss to Smithtown West. West took the lead right from the start, going up 4-0 on a left wing jumper by Billy Behrens and a short baseline drive by Tyler Weigl, and it was 11-5 Bulls on Nick Paquetteâs three point play and a coast to coast drive by Behrens with 1:45 to play in the opening quarter. Behrens added two free to make it 15-8 Smithtown at the first quarter buzzer. Jack Campo drove down the right side of the lane and hit a running hook shot to bring Comsewogue within 5 as the second quarter got underway, and a goaltending call on a shot by Jake LaPasota cut it to 15-12. After a Smithtown free throw, Campo knocked down two freebies to make it a 2 point game, but the Bulls answered with a 10-3 run, capped off by an elbow jumper by Behrens and a fast break basket by Weigl that made it 25-17 Smithtown with 2:56 remaining in the half. A three pointer by Peter Torres bumped the lead to 30-19 with 1:17 to go and it was 33-23 at intermission. Andrew Steck opened the second half with a three pointer for Comsewogue from the left baseline, and his basket from underneath cut it to 34-28, but Paquetteâs three pointer from the right wing and 3 free throws by Weigl gave the Bulls a 12 point lead. Paquetteâs three from behind the right elbow and a steal and fastbreak basket by Behrens made it 48-31 Smithtown, and they led 50-33 with three quarters complete. Nick Grande opened the final quarter with two free throws for Smithtown, but Anthony Colao answered with a foul line jumper for the Warriors and the teams continued to exchange baskets in the early going. Campoâs two free throws cut it to 54-39 with 6:40 to play, but the Bulls answered, and Weiglâs basket from underneath put them up 63-42 with 5:09 left. Campoâs pull-up jumper and free throw and a putback by LaPasota cut it to 63-47 with 4:05 left, and Steck and Campo both went 1 for 2 from the line to make it a 14 point game. A coast to coast basket by Campo and a putback by Sean MacGregor cut it to 65-55 with just under 2 minutes left, but Paquetteâs back to back fast break baskets ended the threat and sent Smithtown West on to the next round. 2/12 Burke Upsets Amityville It was a rematch of last seasonâs NYSPHSAA Class A State Semifinals, and this time Amityville was the favorite. The WarriorsÂ came out likeÂ the team that has dominated opponents all season, confidently building a quick lead, butÂ Burke Catholic, struggling a bit this year after moving up to Class AA,Â would not fold, catching the Warriors at the buzzer for a stunning 74-72 victory. Its been Amityvilles patternÂ over and overÂ thisÂ seasonÂ - Mike Smith and Travis Dickerson led a balanced attack to getÂ the WarriorsÂ off to an intimidating 12-0 start, but Burke settled in and would not let themÂ pull away, trailing by a manageable 11 points at halftime. Still, Amityville maintained their lead throughout the third quarter, although the Eagles did cut the margin to 53-48 on a jumper by Mike Coffey with 1:38 to play in the quarter. Mike Smith answered with a three pointer from the right wing and it was 56-48 Warriors at the third quarter buzzer. Anthony Salmon knocked down two free throws and Trevon Walker spun to the basket and scored to bring Burke within 4 early in the fourth quarter, but Leland Williams answered with a basket from underneath and Malcolm Mathis cut across the lane and scored and it was 60-52 Amityville with 6:25 to play. A fast break basket by Williams gave the Warriors a 10 point lead with 5:27 remaining, but Burke reeled off three straight, with Matt McHale scoring on the break, Salmon on the press break, and Coffey nailing a three from the left wing to cut it to 64-61 at the 4:35 mark. Coffeyâs tip in made it a 1 point game with 3:58 left, but Williams responded with a basket from underneath, Dickerson knocked down two free throws, and Williams scored on the break for a 7 point Amityville lead with 1:40 to play. Coffey drove left and hit a runner to cut it to 70-65 with 1:30 showing, and after a turnover, he drained a three from the left baseline to make it a 2 point game. Another Amityville turnover and Coffeyâs basket from underneath tied it at 70 with 50 seconds to go, but Williams put the Warriors back in front on a fast break basket with 38 seconds to play. Burke tied it again with a baseline jumper by Coffey with 9 seconds on the game clock, plenty of time for Amityville to get the game winner, but the Warriors turned it over again and fouled, and Javin Williams knocked down the game winners from the free throw line. 2/8 2/22 Playoff Report SECTION 11 AMITYVILLE WINS EPIC BATTLE IN OT In what many are describing as the best game of the year, Amityville defeated John Glenn 74-73 in overtime to win the Class A title for the second straight season.Â  DETAILS LATER LuHi Avenges Loss Albany Academy upset Long Island Lutheran earlier this season, but the Crusaders convincingly defeated the Cadets in the rematch, taking a 79-59 decision to capture the First Annual LuHi Winter Invitational. Tournament MVP Devonte Green finished with 19 points, 5 assists, and 6 steals and Elijah Bailey added 14 points. 2/22 Hills East Catches CI The two teams split during the regular season, both winning on the road, but host Hills East won the rubber match, rallying from a 31-19 first half deficit to tie it on a Mathew Boyd pull-up jumper at the buzzer, Â and then the Thunderbirds pulled away for a 60-52 overtime victory in their Section 11 Class AAÂ Quarterfinal. Brandon Hodge opened up the game with a three pointer from the wing and a quick transition layup by David McKenzie gave C.I. an early 5-0 lead. An impressive drive through 3 defenders by Hodge extended the CI lead 12-6, and the Musketeers led 16-12 at the end of the first quarter. The two teams traded baskets until the 4 min mark of the 2nd quarter, when C.I. went on a impressive run, with Devon Solomon hitting two free throws, Hodge getting two quick transition layups, and then an offensive rebound and putback by Malcolm Pridgeon put the Musketeers up 29-18. After a Hills East timeout, C.I. continued to attack with a jumper by Hodge giving them a 31-18 lead, but a Hills East free throw cut it to 31-19 at the half. (Hodge had 13 points and Pridgeon 6 for CI at the half and Jordan McRae led Hills East with 8 ). The third quarter was hard fought by both teams defensively. Hills East opened the quarter with back-to-back baskets by Mike Simon and Justin Fackler, cutting the lead to 8, but David McKenzieâs aggressive layup made it 33-23. Both teams continued to battle, but the C.I. lead was never in question. With 45 seconds left, a Pridgeon put back dunk was called off due to basket interference, but Hills East was not able to capitalize, missing a three point shot at the buzzer. The Musketeers entered the 4th quarter with a comfortable 39-28 lead, but Mike Simon opened the quarter with a three pointer to cut the margin to 8, and after two free throws by Pridgeon, McRae hit a 3 in the corner to make it a 7 point game. Simon âs steal and layup and then his layup off another turnover cut it to 41-38 , but C.I. stopped the bleeding with a McKenzie layup and a Hodge free throw for a 6 point lead. At the 1 minute mark, a Hills East steal led to a Justin Flacker layup, and then an offensive foul gave the Thunderbirds the ball with 35 seconds left. Simon brought the ball up and pulled up for a deep three pointer - so deep the defense wasnt even guarding him - that cut the lead to 1 with 27 seconds left. A Hills East foul sent Hodge to the line with 21 seconds to play, but he missed the front end of a 1 and 1. The T-Birds had the chance to take the lead but were called for a travel, giving C.I. the ball up by 1 with 8.6 seconds remaining. Another Hills East foul sent Devon Solomon to the line , and he went 1 for 2 to make it 47- 45 C.I. Boyd had a good look at a 3 for the win with 6.1 seconds to go, but instead decided to attack the lane and pull up for a mid range jumper that went in at the buzzer and sent the game into overtime. Simon started off OT with another deep three to give Hills East its first lead of the game, and a foul on an offensive rebound by Boyd sent him to the line and he went 2 for 2 to put the Thunderbirds up 52-47. CI answered with a three pointer by Solomon to cut it to 52-50, but thatâs as close as they would get. The Musketeers could not convert as the clock ticked down and started to foul, and Boyd was perfect, going 6 for 6 down the stretch to ice it. Boyd contributed 10 assist, 7 rebounds, 4 steals, McRae contributed 14 rebounds and 6 blocks, and Hodge led CI with 16 points, Pridgeon had 12, and McKenzie and Solomon 9 points each. 2/18 - BY DAN SKARITKA Copiague Impressive They might very well have something to say this year, but make sure you watch out for Copiague next year! The junior dominated Eagles defeated a good Commack team, leading the Cougars wire to wire for an 80-62 Class AA first round playoff victory. Andre Morgan got Copiague going on their first possession, scoring off a nice low post move, and Kevin Roberts followed him with a three pointer from the top to give the Eagles a quick 5-0 lead. A runner by Prince Charles-Hickson made it 9-2 Copiague, and back to back baskets by Quandell Butler, the second a three point play, gave them an 18-6 lead with 2:30 to play in the first quarter. A baseline three pointer by Roberts made it 23-8, and Hicksonâs right wing jumper put Copiague up by 17 with one quarter complete. Brandon Kenneyâs three pointer from behind the right elbow cut it to 25-11 as the second quarter got underway, but it was back and forth to the 4:02 mark, when Brian Lewis scored back to back to cut the margin to 13. Hickson answered with a fast break basket, Joe Branch followed him with a three pointer from the left wing, and then Branch nailed another three from behind the right elbow to give the Eagles a 40-21 lead with 15 seconds remaining in the half.Â  Just before the buzzer, Ryan Steffens broke the run with a three point play to make it a 16 point game at the break. Lewis curled to the basket and scored for Commack as the second half got underway, but Morgan answered with a runner to make it 42-26 Copiague. Lewis seemed determined to get a rally going, attacking again and drawing a foul, this time going 1 for 2 from the line, and then Cougar pressure led to back to back baskets by Kenney off turnovers and it was an 11 point game still early in the quarter. Morgan retook the momentum with a fast break dunk, and then Butlerâs foul line jumper, a three point play by Hickson, and two Butler free throws put Copiague on top 51-31. It was 57-36 Eagles after Roberts scored from underneath on a nice basket cut with 2:12 remaining in the quarter, but three straight baskets by Matthew Glubiak, the third a three pointer, gave Commack hope with 40 seconds left. Butler answered, draining a three from the left wing and the Copiague lead was back to 17, but Glubiak quickly responded, scoring and converting a three point play to make it a 14 point game with three quarters in the books. A left elbow jumper by Lewis cut it to 60-48 as the fourth quarter got underway, but a running hook shot and a baseline drive and reverse layup by Hickson gave Copiague a 16 point lead with 6:46 to play. Billy Holscherâs drive and Glubiakâs fast break basket cut to 66-55 with 4:18 remaining, but Branch rattled in a three pointer from the right wing to put Copiague up 14 with less than 4 minutes left. Glubiak kept the Cougars alive with a 3 from the top at the 3:33 mark, and then his fast break basket off a turnover cut it to 69-60 with 3:18 showing. Another Copiague turnover gave Commack the ball back, but they could not convert, and Hickson scored a big basket, weaving his way through the defense to put the Eagles up by 11 with 2:52 to play. He missed a chance at a three point play, but Copiague rebounded the miss and Morgan was fouled on a putback attempt. He made both free throws to give the Eagles a 73-60 lead with 2:32 remaining, and Commack never seriously challenged after that. 2/14 Â Bachman Wins 400th Jericho head coach Wally Bachman earned his 400th career victory in Jerichos last game of the season, a 57-48 win over Wantagh.
