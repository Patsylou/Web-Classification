GPRC Wolves Men's Basketball Oct 18 GPRC Opens the Regular Season with a Big Win at Home Congratulations to the GPRC Wolves Mens Basketball Team on an outstanding 73-67 win over the visiting SAIT Trojans in the opening game of the regular season.

Thats about the time when an awesome mix of determination and confidence took over and the Wolves willed themselves back into the game outscoring the Trojans 57-35 the rest of the way. The Wolves turned in a team first performance that underscored their awesome determination. The GPRC squad mixed things up, took charges and played a solid overall defensive game. The team moved the ball well in both transition and in the half-court game and was able get to the foul line particularly in the second half of play.

After surgery, chemotherapy and radiation which was completed in January, the couple returned to Tobago to celebrate her recovery and their anniversary. As part of the healing, they opted to pour their blessings by using their skills while in Tobago. Chris is a college basketball coach and professor in Grande Prairie, Alberta. He offered his services for a free coaches clinic and basketball camp for the youth of Tobago. On May 18, 12 local coaches attended an intense two-hour clinic with Nicol. He shared his coaching philosophy and while there was conversation on cultural differences in expectations, the youth on camp day responded positively to Nicols coaching style. For Saturdays camp, he asked for 15 to 24 players. Organisers from Tobagos Ministry of Sport, Carolyn Daniel-Smith, Gerard Franklin and Allison Lawrence were in touch with the couple and the camp topped at 40 players between ages 12-18. There was plenty of Gatorade, water and basketballs. Coaches from Friday nights clinic assisted and gave one-on-one attention to players. Nicol believes that when a player loves a game, its because they are having fun. His wife interviewed players Nicholas Murray, Salanna Scott, Natalie Nedd, Michelle Noel, Arod Philips and ONeil Murray and they all agreed that they learned valuable skills by having fun. Nicholas Murray says that there were some skills he just learned and that by understanding the purpose for the drill it makes it easier to understand why it is important in a game situation, instead of just telling us to dribble up and down. For example, he learned that when running backwards, having ones nose over toes prevents imbalance. Read More Grande Prairie Regional College Aims to Shoot Down Breast Cancer 2012-13 Tough Guys Wear Pink and Love their Moms A broken ankle, a broken nose but no broken heart. Third year point guard and GPRC team captain Josh Nicol is a tough kid. In the opening game of the first season he suffered a minor ankle fracture but was back to play with a bone chip the following weekend. In the first game of the second semester an elbow to the face broke his nose, Josh stopped the bleeding and finished the game only to have it broken again the following weekend. However, it was the heart wrenching news this summer that his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer that truly had the potential to break his heart. But true to form, Josh stepped up and got back in the game. The quiet, undisputed leader of the team chose to respond to the news through positive action. Josh took it upon himself to organize a fundraising event called Wolves Shoot Down Breast Cancer Team members sported pink warm-up tops pink laces, socks, bracelets. The coaching staff, led by Joshs father, has dressed with pink shirts, ties and ribbons throughout the season. Our womens team opened in the pink warm-up tops. The pink warm up shirts were donated to the mens team by Ernies Sport Experts and students from D Taylor School sewed pink ribbons on the uniforms. The final cheque presentation took place this past weekend as the Wolves hosted Augustana who also chose to wear pink for the game in support of Joshs mom. The initiative has raised over $4000 for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. What a blessing it is, to see what love can inspire young men of character to do.
