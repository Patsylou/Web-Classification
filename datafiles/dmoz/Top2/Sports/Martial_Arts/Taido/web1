Taido in Australia Taido is a Japanese martial art that was brought to Australia in 1997 by Fredrik Utbult (6 Dan Kyoshi) and Louise Carlsson (4 Dan Renshi) who have been national team members, club instructors and national coaches in their home country of Sweden. The first club was established at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney and there are current plans to form new clubs in Sydney in the near future. Australia has sent national teams to the World Taido Championships (Sweden 2005 and Japan 2009) and the Sakura Tournaments held in Hirosaki, Japan (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012). Australian Taido also hosts the Asia Pacific Taido Friendship Games and competes in the National All Stars Martial Arts Tournaments.

History Taido is a martial art created in Japan by Seiken Shukumine. He had formerly created the Genseiryu school of karate, but grew to see karate as limited and unchanging. In 1965, he expanded his theories of motion beyond the confines of what could be considered karate and founded Taido. Movement Movement plays such a big role in Taido, that to many it looks like a combination of Capoeira and Karate. Taido emphasizes the use of footwork to take advantageous angles and distance to the opponent. The techniques utilize changes of the bodyâs axis in order to facilitate simultaneous defense and attack. Creativity Taidoâs strategic element is based on creative responses to unfolding situations rather than preset patterns of attack and defense. Taidos competition forms also allow room for creativity, and even reward inventiveness. Creativity also allows teachers to keep training sessions fun and refreshing. Health Taidoâs movements are designed for promoting health and longevity. Taido students will also develop mentally, by having more confidence and by learning to find creative solutions to problems. Furthermore, because Taido is a Japanese martial art, it stimulates students to develop the 7 virtues of bushido.
