Good job. M White , USA The Fastest Method for Gaining the Edge in Combat 100% Better-Than-Money-Back-Guarantee If you aren't completely satisfied with the training manual, just let us know and we'll give you a full refund and you still get to keep the book! Why are top martial artists and fighters moving towards a different way of working out? Simple - the traditional way doesn't work. If you're still doing hours of cardio or roadwork each week, or doing weights with 3 sets of 10 reps in exercises like the bicep curl and leg extensions, you are setting yourself up for defeat. If you've ever sparred or rolled on the mats and either gassed, felt sick of just reached exhaustion and then thought to yourself man, my cardio sucks, then you need this program. Fighting has very little to do with and knowing this is the key to fast improvement. The Science Makes the Difference: Developed and Tested by Fitness Professionals, Law Enforcement Officers and Martial Artists. Your typical fitness program is woefully inadequate for fighters. Most martial artists who want to improve their fitness immediately move to the cardio machines and slog away for 30 minutes or longer. This is AEROBIC fitness training (i.e. the body has time to use oxygen help provide energy). Combat on the other hand is made up of short, sharp, high-intensity bursts of activity and therefore is AN-AEROBIC, where the body doesn't have the time to utitlse oxygen to provide energy. It is this fundamental mis-match in trying to train ANAEROBIC energy systems with AEROBIC exercise that limits many fighter's potential. Basis research into sport exercise related journals reveals the major problems with using aerobic training methods for strength and power sports and indeed The National Strength Conditioning Association's Essentials of Strength and Conditioning clearly states (chapter 5 p78-79) that aerobic training has a negative impact on speed, power and strength. That's right - your fitness program could actually be making you WEAKER... On the other hand, scientific research (Effects of Moderate-Intensity Endurance and High-Intensity Intermittent Training on VO2max, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (1996) 28, 1327-1330) clearly shows that high-intensity ANAEROBIC efforts can have a dramatically positive effect on AEROBIC conditioning. These facts have been pressure-tested around the world by fighters, law enforcement officers, emergency response units, soldiers and many others whose lives depend on their physical conditioning. This manual is specially designed to enable you to apply the very latest in cutting-edge fitness science to your training almost immediately. How Soon Will I Be Fighting Fit? A level of improvement simply not possible with traditional methods can be felt in your Martial Arts sessions in as little as 7 days. The manual is more than just a program to follow. It is designed to tell you everything you need to know about combat fitness. Just imagine knowing that you have access to a wealth of information and training conclusions that your opponents are blindly trying to reach by themselves. Imagine how much faster you will progress than they will. You could spend years of research and trial and error to uncover the information in this book. Think of all the wasted gym fees, hours of misguided training, not to mention the drop in effectiveness of your Martial Arts training because you couldn't train at full intensity for a whole session. By saving yourself, time, effort and $100s in wasted fees, this manual will provide you with a return on investment in only a few days. There are fitness programs that cost nearly $200 and only cover a fraction of the information in this manual. Using these other programs, you may get some benefit in the long run due to a shift in the right direction, but the Adapt and Overcome approach is scientifically proven to provide faster and and more effective results than conventional training. Why Would I get Fitter, Faster Using This Method? The system is based upon three fundamental pillars that work together to optimize results: Training is focused upon the correct energy systems. Training methods are used which stimulate the body to maximize adaptation and development. Exercises are taught which train the body to move as it was designed to. By doing the above, you give the body what it wants and in return it develops faster than if you were to mistakenly continue with other less effective training methods. The manual is designed to complement you Martial Arts training and the workouts are designed to be done alongside your current class schedule. There is even a chapter which discusses how best to schedule your fitness program around your Martial Arts classes. By doing this you can still develop you technique whilst you fitness levels are developing, allowing you to guage progress more effectively and most importantly, withouts sacrificing your skill training. What's In The Manual? The manual consists of fitness theory, exercise tuition, the workout program and some general advice on getting the most from the program. Included in the manual is a 6-week workout schedule.

SpeedBagCentral.com 2014 Sorry,disabled How KoBu Can Teach Self-Defense Escape Techniques KOBU DEFENSE CLASS Your workout becomes your defense, and your defense becomes your workout. In order for anyone to survive a fight or flight situation, the body must rely on instinctive reactions that can only be acquired through repetitive motion known as muscle memory. An example of this is the wax on, wax off scene from the movie, The Karate Kid. Since every movement in the KoBu workout is a self-defense technique, repeated practice of these skills will cause muscle memory. The guiding principle of KoBu Power is : learn once, practice one thousand, practice one thousand to do once. With the knowledge that the movements can be used to save your life, a new dimension of confidence is added to the workout. The hidden self-defense escape technique in KoBu Power is called the of the movement. In reality, most of us don't carry a weapon for protection. KoBu Power trains your body to be the weapon against an attacker. KOBU CARDIO CLASS Martial Art Dance moves designed for anyone of all ages to follow along and Dance their way to Fitness and Self Defense education. Fitness equipment is not needed for the KoBu Cardio class . KOBU POWER BAR CLASS Using Martial Art Dance moves with a weighted bar in a choreographed workout that simulates the skills of a Samurai The bar that's used during the KoBu workout is a training tool that also teaches where to put your hands placement in the defense of an aggressor to create a safe escape. Ancient Art, Modern Motion: A Samurai Cardio-Kickboxing Workout For centuries, the Far East has set the benchmark for fitness and longevity. Various Martial Art disciplines are now recognized as beneficial to people of all ages. KoBu Power is a workout based on the ancient discipline of Kobudo and Kenjutsu, the art of the Samurai. Combining such intense skills with a cardio curriculum in an easy to learn program is the concept of 7the degree Black Belt and Member of the USA Karate Hall of Fame, Michael Graves. KoBu Power has resistance-based Samurai cardio-kickboxing moves that sculpt the body and will burn more calories than most kickboxing fitness classes. KoBu's weighted resistance training will achieve firm and tone muscles.
