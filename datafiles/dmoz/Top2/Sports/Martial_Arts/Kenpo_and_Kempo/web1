What you will find on kenpokarate.com are what my father, Will Tracy, wrote prior to an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down, and the subsequent operation that has left him in so much pain he can't concentrate on writing. My own comments are added in italic notes as well as information I've gotten from my two uncles, Al Tracy and Jim Tracy. (while not the first to have a commercial Kenpo school on the Mainland) NOTE: Original Kenpo Karate Kenpo Karate on the other hand is purely a Japanese word that means Empty Hand. Karate also shows a Chinese origin as kara in Japanese means both empty and China . The two words Kenpo - Karate together would be, as Ed Parker used it, Law of the Fist and Empty Hand.

Al and Jim Tracy had been approved for Shodan just before what would become known as the Walnut Street Putsch (Walnut Street was where Ed's studio was located) in April 1961 and were the only students to receive Shodan ranking from Ed Parker under Traditional Kenpo . Al and Jim Tracy, were promoted to Shodan on January 7, 1962. (SEE Al Tracy Shodan KKAA certificate Chinese Kenpo Ed Parker's Kenpo Ed Parker's system of Kenpo was changed so much with his Chinese Kenpo, that it was no longer Kenpo Karate. Shodan (1st dan), Nidan 2nd dan), Sandan (3rd dan), Yodan (4th dan), Godan Ed Parker only awarded Shodan to six (6) students of Original Kenpo Karate: James Ibrao was Ed Parker's first Shodan , followed by Rich Montgomery, Rick Flores, Ed Tibayan (mispelled Tibian), Al Tracy and Jim Tracy.

The Birth of American Kenpo SGM Edmund K Parker was born in Honolulu. He grew up in the rugged environment of the Honolulu backstreet, where he developed a reputation as a fierce and fearless â? (brawler). He studied Kenpo, one of the original Chinese styles of Kung Fu or Karate, under Professor William K S Chow and soon became the Professorâs protÃ©gÃ©. This became a foundation upon which he would later build one of the most creative and innovative styles in the world.
