Yet at the same time you may feel disappoint or discouragement regarding various aspects of your training and life journey this last year. Remember that success is found not only in your achievements, but also in the journey itself. A very good friend of mine resigned from his position, sold his home, and moved his family in order to pursue the dream of getting a Ph.D. and pursuing a career in teaching. Yet those sacrifices seemed to dissolve into nothing after a few short months as family needs materialized that he could not have foreseen. His inability to continue was not due to lack of trying. It was not due to lack of determination. The path he began had simply come to an end. This was an extremely difficult time for him because he wondered if he had selfishly imposed his own desires on his family, if he had misunderstood the course he was supposed to pursue, But in the end he came to realize that in life we are presented with many roads and not all of them are through streets. Some are dead ends. It is sometimes important merely that we have traveled those roads because in the process we become different people (with more insight, maturity, wisdom, etc.) and our lives impact others on that path in the same way. We are destined to face the paths that lie ahead of us. But some of obstacles we will surmount, others we will avoid and travel around, others are impenetrable and show us a need to change direction. You must think of the strength of water. Water can both wear away obstacles by relentlessly crashing against them again and again. Other times it wisely bypasses and surrounds the barriers that present themselves in order to gain its objective. Do not become fixated on your obstacles, focus on the strengths you have at your disposal to overcome them. Be both as persistent and as unyielding as water and this New Year will become one that you can be proud of. read this post Upcoming Events Hwa Rang Do Meng Sae Students reciting the Hwa Rang Do code of ethics which is composed of five rules and nine philosophical principles.

Thank you for checking out the UW-Eau Claire Hwa Rang Do - Tae Soo Do club! Hwa Rang Do is a traditional and comprehensive Korean martial art, and Tae Soo Do is the introductory style of Hwa Rang Do. The club is a branch of the World Hwa Rang Do Association and is one of the longest running collegiate branches. First started in 1994, it is also the second longest running facility for Hwa Rang Do in the Midwest. What is Hwa Rang Do? Hwa Rang Do is a comprehensive martial arts program. Rather than limiting ourselves to only one area of study, Hwa Rang Do allows the student to train in several programs. From standard kick-punch fighting to joint manipulations, throws, and a number of weapons, to a point sparring program, a grappling program, and a weapon fighting program, Hwa Rang Do has it all. Hwa Rang Do can trace its martial tradition back 2000 years to the Silla Dynasty in Korea, while its structured martial art program has been around since 1960. The main focus of our training is in personal excellence and growth on all levels. For more information, check out the about page.
