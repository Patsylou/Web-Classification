Today it brings closer man and woman, young and old, black and white. It should not be misunderstood as a dance even if many times during the practice or game it resembles a beautiful looking dance form. Sparring is often done to music and singing, and participants usually do all of these. It is unknown whether the origin is an actual martial art designed for defense, or in folk dance with incorporated ritual defense moves. It originated in Africa, and may be the result of the artistic activities of slaves. Salvano once said Capoeira cannot exist without black men. Even the origin of the name of the art is not known with certainty. This webring is for sites about capoeira and schools of capoeira, as well as sites with information. This art is now practiced worldwide.

Since training capoeira with ACSF my confidence has gone up. Learning capoeira forced me to break out of my nervous barrier, and push myself past self-perceived limits Jorge Aguirre STUDENT since he was 8 years old ABADĂ -Capoeira SF performed during our pre-game entertainment for The Oakland Raiders at the Hispanic Heritage game. We were very impressed with their performance. Through the use of live music our fans were able to experience a true performance of Brazilian Martial Arts.
