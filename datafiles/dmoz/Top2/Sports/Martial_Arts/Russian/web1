Systema (Russian Martial Arts) is a hand-to-hand fighting system, presently in use by the Russian Armed Forces. Unlike traditional martial arts used for "sport", Systema is military based and current. The merits of learning Systema are immediately realized by the "every-day-man" when one learns the tactical advantages of an efficient military based martial art. In Systema, the synergy of three components creates a TRUE WARRIOR - Combat Skill, Strong Spirit and Healthy Body.The body has to be free of tension, filled with endurance, flexibility, effortless movement and explosive potential. History of Russian Martial Art The Russian style of martial art dates back to the 10th century. Throughout the history of this huge country, Russia had to repel invaders from the north, south, east, and west. All attackers brought their distinct styles of combat and weaponry. The battles took place on different terrain, during freezing winters and sweltering summer heat alike, with the Russians often greatly outnumbered by the enemy forces. As a result of these factors, the Russian warriors acquired a style that combined strong spirit with extremely innovative and versatile tactics that were at the same time practical, deadly, and effective against any type of enemy under any circumstances. The style was natural and free while having no strict rules, rigid structure or limitations (except for moral ones). All tactics were based on instinctive reactions, individual strengths and characteristics, specifically designed for fast learning. When the Communists came to power in 1917, they suppressed all national traditions. Those practicing the centuries-old style of martial art were severely punished. However, the authorities quickly realized the viability and potency of the Russian martial art and thus reserved it for the elite units of Spetsnaz. Since the collapse of the Soviet system, many other Russian fighting styles have re-emerged through training, competition, and media publicity. Among others, the styles include: Sambo (a wrestling style), Slaviano-Goretskaya Borba (StormWarrior Style), military style of A. Kadochnikov, plus a variety of folk styles (e.g. Busa, Skobar, Forest Warrior, Kozachiy Sploch, fist fighting by Gruntovsky). Register Help Remember Me? What's New?

Close Ad Interview  with Matt Clempner by SFUKED Matt in Black SFUKED: Matt, you're the  chief instructor of ROSS in the UK. What do you feel are the benefits of the  Russian style to those of us interested in cross training? Matthew  Clempner: Hi SFUKED, I hope you are well. As for your question, the benefits  of using Russian style are many but probably the greatest is the flexibility  due to working on principles of movement rather than technique - this makes  ROSS versatile in any situation and can help in any sport or martial art,  as well as being effective in its own right as a combat system. SFUKED: I believe your  system originated with General Retuinshikh. Could you tell us a little about  him and how he developed the system? General  Retuinshikh demo's the flowing movements of ROSS Matthew  Clempner: Alexander did develop this system, although it was already there,  hidden for centuries. He just brought it out and rebuilt it into what it is  now and made it more scientific and effective. SFUKED: Got any good stories  about the General? Matthew  Clempner: Yea, as you may know Alexander is a Master of Sport for Judo & Sambo,  also he had a reputation as a street fighter in his youth. When he returned  home from his studies the local guys said he had gone soft, all they could  see was dancing type collection of movements which looked nothing! So a match  (fight) was organised with the town's hero, a karate champ, Alex did not just  win I believe he played with the man. This and other similar situations gained  Alexander a following in his home town which was the beginning of the ROSS  story. SFUKED: You've just come  back from training in Russia. What was that all about? Matthew  Clempner: Myself and three fellow Russian martial artists, Frank Etherson  of Scot Ross a Police trainer and Chris Heath of Salford Academy, a Psychiatric  Therapist and Fred Turner a Judo coach. It was an important camp this year,  martial art masters from the world head of family sokeship council were present.  For me personally, this was the first time I had heard of these guys, but  each one was a master in his own art. The other big event of this camp was  the arrival of the Minister of Sport and other government officials. The Minister  was standing in for the Prime Minister who unfortunately could not attend.  A demonstration and display was given for the VIPS and all heads of foreign  annexes and branches (including myself) had to give a short speech. At the  end of this program the Minister awarded Alexander Retuinshikh the honour  of Honourary Coach of Russia. As you know, Russian Martial Art Federation  is the only Russian Martial Art organisation recognised by the Russian Government.  However, the greatest thing was to train with real Russian Masters again,  most of whom are serving military or ex war veterans. SFUKED: I heard Alexandre  Karelin was going to be there. Did you have the chance to train with him?  Matthew  Clempner: No, unfortunately, he was not there. A very close friend of mine,  Konstantin Tinovitsky, Honorary coach of Russia for Sambo, said he was injured.  SFUKED: How importantly  do you rate supplementary training such as weights, calisthenics and stretching?  Matthew  Clempner: I've always done weights, sometimes every day, in my earlier days  I did some powerlifting and once won a medal in a National Olympic Lifting  competition..However due to my sport circuit training and daily stretching  is a must. I have found since I've began training in RMA I have become more  supple in my muscles. SFUKED: You have a reputation  for extremely smooth and graceful technique despite being a large and powerful  chap. How did you develop this (I only ask coz I'm not smooth and graceful,  as well as being small and weak)? Matthew  Clempner: Thank you for those kind words sir, as a young heavyweight I was  fast and agile (even for 20st) but these days I am somewhat slower (and 3st  heavier) although I believe the flowing style training in Russian Martial  Arts and regular mat work maintains co-ordination. SFUKED: You've competed  at the highest level in Judo and Freestyle as well as Sambo, care to tell  us a little about your competition history? Matthew  Clempner: Sure, .......5th Dan Judo 5th Dan Ju Jitsu 4th Dan Taiho Jutsu GB  International for Wrestling, EEC Wrestling Champion 1980 Olympic Games. National  Judo Squad Member, GB Judo International 3x National Taiho Jutsu Champion  5x British FreestyleWrestling Champion 9x English FreestyleWrestling Champion  6x Police '' '' '' Silver European Police Judo Championships1980 & Bronze  1988 6x British Sambo Wrestling Champion (1977 - 1990) 2x European Sambo Bronze  Medalist , 1989 World Sambo Bronze Medalist. 1990 Mr. Sambo (Moscow World  Sambo Championships) 1999 Awarded International Master of Sport at Khlampiev  Tournament Moscow. SFUKED: What do you think  are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these arts (vis a vis throwing  and groundwork) and what made you go with Sambo as your art of choice? Matthew  Clempner: The mix of different wrestling styles attracted me the most, although  it lacks some of the skills of Judo, (strangles are not usual in Sambo) the  lack of restrictions on throws and groundwork allow freedom of personal strengths  and with a jacket there is no limit. SFUKED: In the Russian  Martial Arts are striking and grappling kept separate or are they combined?  Matthew  Clempner: "Combined, the whole is greater then the part", Khlampiev (one of  the founders of Sambo) said when asked " Which is best? Wrestling or Boxing,  Judo or Karate, how can any part be greater then the whole.'' SFUKED: If they are integrated  what methods are used to achieve this? Matthew  Clempner: The 'ROSS' originated in Wrestling and Dance by using fluid principles  of movement for the untrained eye to see where striking/grappling ends and  grappling/striking begins. SFUKED: What weapons are  trained in the Russian style? Matthew  Clempner: All and any objects in time of need are weapons, it is the first  and basic lesson. We just need to follow the principles to understand better.  We train with knives, sticks, guns, swords and even books, belts, pens, bags  and clothes. SFUKED: How much emphasis  do you place on weapons training and why? Matthew  Clempner: Weapons are an extension of the Art. Such training is dependent  on the needs of my students.(eg security staff sometimes require weapon defence  training). SFUKED: Ok Matt, thanks  for taking the time to share this with us. Finally where are you based and  how can people get in touch to recruit you for seminars and so on.

ANOTHER FIGHT, ANOTHER ARM FOR ROUSEY of Team Hayastan   Ronda Rousey Beats Julia Budd in 39 Seconds of round 1 - via ArmbarThe only difference this time was that she hung on until there was no doubt.â? Ronda Rousey raised her professional record to 4-0 by submitting fellow 145-pounder Julia Budd in the co-main event of Strikeforce Challengers 20 on Saturday in Las Vegas. Rousey got the tapout 39 seconds into the fight with an armbar, the hold that won all of her previous mixed martial arts fights, including three amateur affairs before turning pro in March.None of Rouseyâs fights, pro or amateur, have lasted longer than 57 seconds.She started this one with another rapid conclusion in mind. Rousey clinched with Budd and pushed her into the cage five seconds after the bout started, got the takedown 11 seconds later and quickly mounted her. Budd employed a standard MMA technique for fighters trapped on the bottom by using her feet to push away from the fence, but it gave Rousey space to isolate her opponentâs right arm and extend it for the submission hold.Budd rolled in an effort to escape or at least prevent her limb from being stretched, but Rousey converted the hold to a belly-down armbar and torqued the elbow further, then completely dislocated the joint as she rolled back into traditional armbar position. The arm was clearly popped out of the elbow at a painful-looking angle by the time Budd yielded with a tap.The definitive ending contrasted sharply with Rouseyâs August victory against Sarah DâAlelio, who claimed she did not give up even though Rousey and cageside observers heard a cry or yell that the referee interpreted as a verbal submission. The crowd for that bout booed the uncertain nature of the finish.No one could question the result this time.âm stoked,â? Rousey said during her post-fight interview in the cage. âThat was really good. Iâm glad you guys are cheering for me this time.â?Rousey, who plans to drop down a weight class, called out 135-pound former champion Sarah Kaufman. Although Kaufman hopes for a rematch with titleholder Miesha Tate, Rousey wants to clear her own shot at the belt.âIf Sarah Kaufmanâs next in line, please, Strikeforce, let me get a crack at her first,â? Rousey said. âI really want to have a title fight against Miesha Tate. I donât want to take a risk on her losing.â?Kaufman defeated Tate in 2009. 2011 Gokor Chivichyan's Official Site Free Joomla Templates by Deposit Poker & Unlimited Web Hosting Close Ad Last update January 19, 2000 SAMBO CLUB EMAIL matsay@mail.ru Ukraine Flag SK Links on the Ukraine By Linda Hodges Facts Map Welcome to the Ukraine Homeland Page Embassy Wash.DC Sambo Links Sambo UBC Link Page Vladimir K.
