You may have seen my multi-page feature in Black Belt Magazine, or read that Black Belt Magazine honored me as one of the world's top-20 street fighters. You may have seen my state-of-the-art strength and conditioning ideas written about in American Health and Fitness Magazine. You may have read a review of my seminal submission grappling series, The Lost Art of Hooking. Or, you may be one of the countless fighters and grapplers who has turned to me to learn a complete and fully integrated fighting system â one that, when properly mastered, will not only turn you into a dominant all-around fighter, but will in fact transform you into the kind of person who feels confident and at ease in just about any surroundings. Regardless of your reason for visiting, you've come to the right place. And here's why: Tony Cecchine's American Catch Wrestling â while adaptable to sport competition â is first and foremost reality based. True, I've trained men and women who have fought and won in such events as UFC, Pancrase, NAGA, IFC, and the like. But more importantly, my teachings have helped change (and in some cases even save) lives. Because in the world outside the ring or cage, there is no tapping out â and people who train with the availability of a ready concession in mind will be unprepared for the potentially more brutal reality of the streets.

Learn about my American Catch Wrestling system in its entirety â from its emphasis on controlling when, where, and how a confrontation takes place to its seamless integration of striking, wrestling, ripping, and submission grappling â and Iâm sure youâll agree that my complete approach to fighting offers an advantage over the rather segmented and artificial way many other âfight systemsâ? piece together various disciplines in the attempt to approximate what in American Catch Wrestling is an organic whole.
