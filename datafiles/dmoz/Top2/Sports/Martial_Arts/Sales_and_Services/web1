Â This is a great time to be looking at your stats from 2013 and seeing where you need to make improvements. Â One big area seems to be the incoming phone calls. Â Most schools spend an average of $50 per generated lead to get the phone to ring. Â A lead that calls your school has already begun evaluating you, looking for reasons to join or reasons to avoid you. Â How long it takes you to answer the phone and how they are greeted is just the beginning of the phone call. Â  Â Your goal for the phone call is to generate an Intro Lesson Appt. Â 80% of all phone calls should result in an Intro Lesson. Â  How are your results? Monday Power-Up Staff Meeting Ray C. on Sunday , March 10 th , 2013 in MAFE News | Comments (0) Hello Team, Â  I wanted to encourage you to make every effort to be on the call/video for Mondays Meeting. Â We are going to cover a lot of ground. Â Our Leadership Training is going to be very powerful, and will help us all develop a better understanding on how to pick, train, and build a World Class Staff.Â  Â  On Mondays Meeting we will:Â  Â  1. Continue our Focus on Building the Million Dollar Dojo. Â We will specifically focus on the ABD Sales System and how to develop the right mindset that will turn more inquiries into appointments.Â  Â  2. Â The most important exercise to do when you close out monthly stats. Â This one exercise will help you make every year a record breaking year.Â  Â  3. Â Leadership 101: Â Why do people follow people? Â The Answer is found in understanding the Leadership Drivers. Â The more you understand the Leadership Drivers the more you will know how to hire, and develop a World Class Team.Â  Â  Looking Forward to Monday, Â  Mr. Garcia Birthday Tips for You Ray C. on Tuesday , March 5 th , 2013 in School Marketing | Comments (0) Please join us every Monday morning, for our Monday Power Up Meeting / Webinar.

Posted in Free Stuff , Martial Arts School Business Systems | Comments Off Read More Older Entries What are the Experts Saying? Jhoon Rhee, Father of American Tae Kwon Do "My Student, Stephen Oliver is the new generation of leaders in the Martial Arts Industry. Itâs important to me to have him on my Team to really continue developing my business." âWhen it comes to combining Martial Art marketing genius with the latest technologies. Stephen Oliver is the proven authority. Whether you are "technology-handicapped", like me, or have a strong technology back-groundâŚ.. you need this program! âStephen Oliver knows the martial arts profession as well as anyone. He brings with him an amazing intellect and a unique perspective honed from years in the trenches.â? âStephen Oliver is one of those highly competent, hard working, visionary people who can literally make things happen by bringing all the resources he has to a project and by inspiring those around him to work synergistically in the effort. He consistently sees what is possible and works tirelessly for powerful results.â? âStephen was my mentor in the late 80's and helped me take a brand new martial art school and helped me enroll 180 students in 90 days and open 4 schools and gross over $1,000,000.00 in 18 months, and that was back when a million dollars was real money.:)" Tim Kovar "I learned a tremendous amount at Stephen Oliverâs Ultimate Martial Arts Marketing Bootcamp. I highly encourage you to attend, have a great time, mastermind with some of the best minds in the industry â be challenged to take your school to the next level. By the way, you might just end up being a millionaire" "Stephen Oliver is without a doubt one of the most educated martial arts businessmen in America, but thatâs not the reason I endorse his seminar. What makes Stephen Oliverâs marketing seminar the best I've seen is his ability to identify and simplify the critical success factors involved in running a martial arts school, and to teach average school owners who donât have an MBA, or even a college degree, how to do exactly what he and other millionaire school owners have done to become rich. Stephen Oliver knows how to make a lot of money teaching martial arts, and school owners can make a fortune doing what he says." âWhen you can team with other martial arts school owners in NAPMA, your professional association, and have great leadership from someone like Stephen Oliver, then you will have the opportunity to grow personally and professionally much more than you could just by yourself,â? "We were truly impressed by the caliber of speakers and the quality of â? topics presented at your last boot camp. You bring a fresh perspective that simplifies the business of Martial Arts while providing the essential business tools school owners need to succeed in their market. Any school owner who wants to make an impact in their market and increase revenue will benefit from your innovative approach, relaxed atmosphere and powerful seminars â packed with the latest marketing ideas and business tips from the industryâs top school owners. We are looking forward to participating at your next camp."
