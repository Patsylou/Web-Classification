Have FUN Improve SKILLS Make FRIENDS Be GOOD at something For EXCITEMENT For FITNESS To be part of the CLUB For CHALLENGE To LEARN new skills To WIN (lowest priority) The primary role of PCYC (Police and Citizens' Youth Clubs) is to contribute to the Western Australia Police Service Crime Prevention Strategy. That is, early intervention crime prevention. Neighbourhood-based, affordable youth activities provide an outlet. Kids channel energy into sport and gymnastics is the BEST sport, in this author's opinion. This website was set-up to provide gymnastics advice to archive resources. PCYC coaches gymnasts need set priorities carefully we have very few hours of training / week. We must spend them wisely. First priority is safety . We need practice the safest, most foolproof drills possible. Second priority, is FUN . It is more important to have fun each workout than to improve skills, for example. No sport can improve FITNESS more quickly easily than gymnastics; strength, flexibility, agility, balance, coordination, etc. Gymnasts are amongst the most fit athletes in Australia. Kids that are having fun will get fit. Fit kids learn the FUNDAMENTALS of gymnastics more easily; more safely. This website is edited by Rick McCharles e-mail a coach from Canada.
