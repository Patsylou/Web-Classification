Subscribe to feed Xcel Floor Clarification Posted: 02.17.2014 I have gotten permission from Claudia Kretschmer, National Xcel Committee Chair, to send out this Xcel Floor change/clarification effective immediately. The official Errata for this has been submitted and will be posted online soon. On Bronze Floor Rules Chart (Pg 139) Clarifications Box: Add Straddle jump (any split angle) = VP Add Side leap (any split angle) = VP On page 141, II. A., 2., add c. Straddle jump (any split angle) = VP On page 141, II. A., 2., add d. Side leap (any split angle) = VP This means that even if a Bronze gymnast performs a straddle jump or side leap with a split angle such that it could receive a VP, she will receive VP credit and it may fulfill a SR credit, if applicable. There would be no deduction for an unallowable element. Elaine Wulf Region 8 Xcel Chair Posted In: Programs Related Categories: Programs , Technical , Newsletters View Article Xcel Code Errata and Code replacement pages Posted: 02.06.2014 The latest Xcel Code Errata and Code replacement pages are now available . USA Gymnastics has sold out of the first printing of the Xcel Code! The second edition (incorporating all the errata up to this point) is being printed now. Some clarifications of questions I have received: Vault A mini-tramp is not an alternative springboard apparatus. An alternative springboard apparatus is a none-brand-specific term for an aero-board. Mini tramps may not be used in USA Gymnastics sanctioned competitions. Bars Beam A panel mat may be used for mounting. Xcel follows Rules Policies using Compulsory guidelines as a minimum standard (R P, page 80 VI., A.). Rules Policies, page 66, G., 5., a. states At Levels 1-5, any manufactured mat....may be used for mounting purposes. Bars When performing the glide swing, punch, pullover connection to mount, any board or mounting mat must be pulled immediately after the jump into the glide. The punch for the pullover must be done off of matting that is acceptable to be under the apparatus for the entire routine. Reference Rules Policies page 66, 6, b, circle bullet point and Xcel Code, page 194, II., C., 3., Example. Beam A round-off is a valid dismount. It is considered a cartwheel with a 1/4 turn dismount. Please reference skill 9.103 on page 135 in the Xcel Code. Floor A cartwheel-cartwheel series is NOT impossible to connect. This series should not be as going to be broken. Yes, the feet should not pivot. However, gymnasts who have worked cartwheels entering and exiting sideways could do quite well at this connection.

Gymnast going out of order There is no deduction for athletes competing out of order at invitational meets that use a competitive start list.The coach may change the order if it will facilitate the use of equipment on the same setting. Balance Beam reminder Only a backward acro flight would be considered broken when the arms move as low as the thighs or further back after the landing of the first element in the connection. It does not apply to series of non-flight acro, acro flight with forward and/or sideward elements, counter acro flights, and dance or mixed elements.If a leg swing on the step between two acro elements goes higher than 45, it breaks the series connection, regardless of the value of the elements. Falls Reminder that incomplete elements due to a fall for compulsory and optional exercises. Compulsory: Consider the value of the major element and determine how much of the element was performed before the fall occurred.Credit is given for the part of the element that was performed before the fall occurred and deducts -0.50 for the fall.The gymnast also has the option of repeating the element without penalty to attempt to complete it if they are successful at completing the element on the second try; the original deduction is eliminated.After a fall in compulsories, the judging resumes from the point of interruption. Optional: If the element is complete (no touch of the bars on a release or not landing on bottoms of feet for acro elements and dismounts) no value part credit is given plus the -0.50 for the fall.After a fall in Optionals, the judging resumes with the performance of the first element listed in the JO Code. Optional Floor Clarification - #2.203 1/1 turn on one leg to scale forward (2 sec.) The turn should be completed in relev, but the heel is allowed to lower to the floor for the 2 sec hold in scale. Failure to put a cell phone in airplane mode when used for Floor Exercise music is not considered a technical failure, it is considered a coaching error. If the music is stopped due to a phone call, the gymnast must continue her routine without the music and has no option to repeat the routine. In this case, there is no deduction for absence of music Xcel questions should be sent to Elaine Wulf, Region 8 Xcel Chairman - email . Any Xcel technical question should be directed to Marian Dykes, Region 8 Technical Chairman - email .

Committee Chairman 2301 26 th Street North St. Petersburg, FL 33713 E-Mail Region 8 Professional Members: Happy New Year! There a few announcements that I would like to make so that we are all up to date. The Legends Funds will once again be paying for 100% of the Level 10 entries into Nationals in Jackson, MS and our Level 9 Eastern entries in Bradenton, FL. Thanks to everyone that supported the fund last year. thanks for keeping the memories of Region 8s - greats alive and really making a difference in the lives of our athletes and families. Region 8 has once again, reserved a block of rooms for the J.O. National Championships. For reservations, all coaches and athlete families will be given a booking link at Regional Championships - post qualification. The rat es are TBA. The block release date will be April 17 th , 2014 . We will be in a hotel about 10 minutes from the venue with plenty of rooms to accommodate all of us. If you have already booked hotel accommodations at another hotel in the Jackson area please cancel them. The Region is continuing our attempt to foster National Team camaraderie. 2014 J.O. Training Camp Announcements: # 1 = Regional Team Training Camp July 18-20, 2014 Gymnastix, Atlanta area. Qualifiers: ALL Level 7 8 2014 State and or Regional Qualifiers. # 2 = R 8 Nationals Team Training Camp September 5-7, 2014 U. of Georgia Qualifiers: ALL 2014 NIT Qualifiers All 2014 L 9 and 10 athletes that qualified to the L 9 Eastern or L 10 National Meet All active elite and - elite athletes. # 3 = L 8, 9, 10 Regional Training Camp Oct. 10-12, 2014 Orlando Metro, FL Qualifiers: All L 8, 9 and 10 athletes that qualified to the previous years Regional Championship meet or above. It is my hope that our camp system will continue to provide great training, learning and recruitment opportunities for our athletes, coaches and judges alike to help Region 8 continue on its path to National prominence. With that said however, supporting our training camps will continue to be of the utmost importance. Region 8 will continue our requirement stating that a club must be in good standing in regard to training camps to be eligible for the ALL-STAR Trip. In Good standing means that each club must do one or more of the following: Host a R 8 Training Camp within the last 2 years Send a volunteer coach or coaches to a Camp to actively work with gymnasts within the last 2 years (NEW in 2010) Send an athlete or athletes to a Camp within the last 2 years (New in 2010) Make a $1,000 donation to the Regional Apparel Fund Clubs failing to meet these criteria are making the decision to be ineligible for funding of the Trip if one or more of your athletes qualify. An athlete from a club that is deemed NOT in Good Standing may only attend the trip at her own expense. Additionally if the coach or coaches wanted to accompany their athlete they would have to pay for 100% of the trip. Please do not put yourself in this position. We stuck with these criteria with the knowledge that the training camps cannot be a success without the support of ALL of our clubs. The funds created by the camps are the funds that are the life blood our athletes and coaches for apparel and our trip. Please do your part with the understanding that when you support the training camps you are ultimately supporting yourself! The 2014, the trip will be in late July on the 24 th -27 th weekend in Las Vegas. The team will once again be made up of the level 9 10 athletes that best represent Region 8 at 2014 Easterns and Nationals. The team and attending coaches will be housed in a local hotel and be transported via van or bus while in the host town.It is our hope that this trip has been and will continue to be a great source of motivation within the Region. The Region will furnish the funds for the athletes (minus meals and excursion fees). Coaches that qualify athletes may also attend but at their own expense. The qualification system is as follows: The top six L 9s (plus ties) and the top six L 10s (plus ties) from Eastern/National Championships will make up the team. The team is chosen as follows: Any athlete(s) that place first in the AA get first priority. Any athlete(s) that place second in the AA fill any remaining spots. Any athlete(s) that place third in the AA fill any remaining spots. If there are still spots available the athlete(s) with the highest AA score regardless of Age Group will make up the remainder of the team. Graduating Seniors are ineligible for the trip. The Region 8 Committee will also be hosting our second, Tim Rand Memorial Golf Scramble on June 22, 2014 at Quail Hollow Golf Club in the Tampa area in conjunction with Region 8 Congress. There will be an 11:00 a.m. Registration and Boxed Lunch with a 12:00 p.m. Shotgun Start. Please join us for a fun filled day of golf, prizes and food to commemorate Tim Rand's passing by doing something that he loved. All proceeds from this event will directly support the recently renamed TR Legends Fund. This fund gives thousands of dollars annually to the membership of Region 8. To make this event the best it can possibly be we are looking for golfers to take part in what we feel is going to be a wonderful day! The Tournament will be a four-person scramble. We will have prizes and other fun contests available for those who wish to take part. After the tournament we will have an awards ceremony, raffle give-aways, a silent auction and buffet in the beautiful clubhouse. The price per player will be $100.00 and information can be found here.
