How will it end? "All my life, I have been fascinated by the big questions that face us, and have tried to find scientific answers to them. If, like me, you have looked at the stars, and tried to make sense of what you see, you too have started to wonder what makes the universe exist. The questions are clear, and deceptively simple. But the answers have always seemed well beyond our reach. Until now. "The ideas which had grown over two thousand years of observation have had to be radically revised. In less than a hundred years, we have found a new way to think of ourselves. From sitting at the center of the universe, we now find ourselves orbiting an average-sized sun, which is just one of millions of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy. And our galaxy itself is just one of billions of galaxies, in a universe that is infinite and expanding. But this is far from the end of a long history of inquiry. Huge questions remain to be answered, before we can hope to have a complete picture of the universe we live in. "I want you to share my excitement at the discoveries, past and present, which have revolutionized the way we think. From the Big Bang to black holes, from dark matter to a possible Big Crunch, our image of the universe today is full of strange sounding ideas, and remarkable truths. The story of how we arrived at this picture is the story of learning to understand what we see." -- STEPHEN HAWKING TV Schedule/Programs Six essays by ASTRONOMY magazine Associate Editor Richard Talcott -- one for each program of the STEPHEN HAWKING'S UNIVERSE series -- explain the ideas, discoveries, answers, and questions of the universe and beyond. These original essays draw from the programs and analyze the key issues, whether simple or complex. Also included: national and local TV schedule information. Strange Stuff Explained What in the world (or in the universe) are quarks and quasars, nebulae and neutrinos? How can time be imaginary? Is a wormhole anything like an anthill? For definitions and descriptions of the tricky terminology of the universe, this is where the strange stuff becomes a little less so. Cosmological Stars History will, no doubt, recognize many of today's theorists and scientists for their astonishing collective and personal contributions to our future understanding of the universe. Here we recognize some -- though certainly not all -- of those whose ideas or discoveries have, over time, shaped human understanding of the stars and beyond. Universes Hundreds of years ago, everyone believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe. Today we know better, but a complete picture of the universe remains elusive. From the ancient notion of a flat Earth to today's theories on the very shape of past and future history, ideals of the universe have evolved with the help of scientific discovery and the eternal human imagination. Unsolved Mysteries Leading cosmologists address the questions even they have yet to answer. MARCELO GLEISER: Where Does Matter Come From? MICHIO KAKU: Is Time Travel Possible? CARLOS FRENK: Where Is the Missing Matter? ALAN GUTH: An Eternity of Bubbles? SETH SHOSTAK: An Inhabited Universe? MICHIO KAKU: Is There a Theory of Everything? LEE SMOLIN: What Is the Future of Cosmology? Things To Do In the Dark Some Web sites present fascinating photographs from galaxies millions of light-years away, while others feature online discussions among today's leading cosmologists. But where to look first? Our resources list describes and links to great spots on the Web, as well as books and magazines, for the cosmology enthusiast.

Spotts , Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor Just when it SEEMS the broad outline of the universe's origin is as safely in hand as money in the bank, along come two physicists who could prove to be the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid of cosmology. Skip to next paragraph Related stories Universe some 80 million years older than thought, say scientists Big bang's 'afterglow' reveals universe to be a bit older, with more matter Unusual Russian quasicrystal rock has ancient extraterrestrial history Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS of The Christian Science Monitor Weekly Digital Edition For 20 years, Paul Steinhardt has played a key role in helping to write and refine the inflationary big bang origin of the universe. But over the past few years, the Princeton University physicist and some of his colleagues have struggled with a vexing question. Even if our story seems to describe what we see, how do we know it's the right story? Dr. Steinhardt asks. He decided to see if he could come up with a plausible alternative to the prevailing notion. The inflationary big-bang model posits that the universe began as a random fluctuation in empty space, grew with extraordinary speed through an period, then slowed, cooled, and formed all the matter and energy astronomers see and infer today. Steinhardt wanted to be able to describe the universe with as much precision as the inflation theory does but without some of its including the need for an inflationary period itself. The result: He and Cambridge University physicist Neil Turok have unveiled a model in which the universe has no beginning or end, but replenishes itself in a cycle of expansion and contraction. Each expansion is triggered by its own big bang. Steinhardt adds that, among its other selling points, the new model naturally accounts for recent observations that the universe is entering an epoch of accelerated expansion, a feature he says is not directly predicted by the inflationary big bang. The model, published late last month in the journal Science, is a work in progress. Some researchers, such as Princeton astrophysicist Jeremiah Ostriker, have hailed it as extraordinarily exciting and ... the first new big idea in cosmology in over two decades. Others, such as Stanford University's Andrei Linde, another inflation pioneer, are intensely skeptical. The duo's rebellion against the reigning explanation for the universe's origin may seem out of character for what many people view as the staid world of science. People have the idea that scientists and cosmologists believe something like it was dogma, says Rocky Kolb, a cosmologist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill. We seem like a conservative lot, but ... everybody wants to turn everything upside down. But new ideas have to pass sniff tests. And for some researchers, ideas posed in prose, with no math for backup, are sure-fire candidates for the circular file. Really beautiful ideas have experimental and observational consequences, although decades may pass before predicted results emerge, Kolb says. He also points out that a lot of ideas come from people in different fields or people you may not know. In 1980, not many cosmologists had heard of Alan Guth, who came up with inflation. Drawing on quantum physics and Einstein's theories of relativity, the inflationary big bang begins 11 billion to 15 billion years ago, when a random change in an astonishingly small bit of all-encompassing vacuum grew very rapidly. For a tiny fraction of a second, this burgeoning fluctuation in the vacuum expanded faster than light can travel. When the burst of inflation abruptly ended, the proto-universe reached enormous energies, temperatures, and pressures. As this roiling universe continued to expand at a more sedate rate and cooled, its matter, energy, and structure emerged. 1 2 About these ads Subscribe The Christian Science Monitor Today!

The mathematical universe Why cosmology is not only a matter for astronomers and physicists, but also for mathematicians Cosmic Sound: Curvature and the cosmic background radiation How the spatial geometry of the universe can be derived by observing the cosmic background radiation Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements How the first nuclei of helium, lithium and other light elements were cooked up shortly after the big bang Equilibrium and Change: The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the period shortly after the big bang that saw the first production of light elements such as helium and lithium Elements of the past: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and observation How to reconstruct the abundances of light elements shortly after the big bang, and thus test some important predictions of the big bang models against observation Searching for the quantum beginning of the universe About attempts to understand the beginning of our universe using different approaches to quantum gravity Avoiding the big bang The collapsing and then re-expanding quantum universe that loop quantum gravity offers as a replacement of the standard big bang models Taming infinity with loops How loop quantum gravity could replace the absurd state of infinite density, the big bang with which, according to Einstein's relativity, the universe began Heat that meets the eye The connection between temperature and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, as well as the consequences for stars, matter disks around black holes, and cosmology Document Actions Print this Permanent link 2014 |
