Third Annual Conference was held in Palermo, Italy. Visit the site for more details. Culture and Cosmos . A journal supporting the scholarly study of astrology and cultural astronomy. Quoting from the page: Culture and Cosmos is a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal devoted to the study of the history of astrology and cultural astronomy. If astrology is the use of celestial phenomena to provide meaning for human life, then cultural astronomy is the broader use of astronomical beliefs and theories to regulate and inform society, politics, the arts and every aspect of human life. Astronomiae Historia / History of Astronomy . Maintained by Wolfgang Dick, this page remains a primary starting point for those interested in all aspects of scholarly pursuit in the history of astronomy and astronomy in culture. The Center for Archaeoastronomy . The primary purpose of the Center is to advance research, education and public awareness of archaeoastronomy. In combination with the International Society of Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture, the Center supports scholarly research in history of astronomy and cultural astronomy throughout the globe. The Oxford Conferences on Archaeoastronomy . Paraphrasing goals stated on the page, the Oxford Conferences on Archaeoastronomy are meetings that focus on the role that astronomical phenomena have played in human societies. The conferences serve as a meeting place for those working in anthropology, archaeology, history and prehistory, archaeoastronomy, and other studies of human cultures. The North American Sun Dial Association . As stated on the page, the North American Sundial Society is an association of people from a wide variety of disciplines who are interested in the study, development, history, and preservation of sundials and the art of dialing throughout the continent. Despite its reference to "the continent", the Association supports research in the use of time pieces historically in many cultures.

 : 2012.08.09 - In 1997, when this research article was accomplished, formulas for astronomy constants were not as refined as today. Now, given new formulations and application of the distinction between atomic and ephemeris time, results will be slightly different. Rather than overwrite this step in examination of ancient astronomy, I'm leaving the article intact with the caveat that researchers should utilize the latest methods to examine the questions raised herein and should expect new results to vary.

 Biennial History of Astronomy Workshops Home Upcoming Workshop Past Workshops Group Photos Useful Links Contacts Biennial History of Astronomy Workshops Overview In 1993 the first Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop took place at the University of Notre Dame and launched what has become a stimulating forum for scholars of all levels and interests in the history of astronomy. Notable has been the workshop's attention to the teaching of the history of astronomy as well as the warm welcome given to graduate students and independent scholars. A workshop typically attracts 60-65 scholars who take part in a thematic program of talks, panel discussions, and, in some years, hands-on demonstrations. All aspects of the history of astronomy receive attention and across all time periods. Furthermore, the workshop's residential format ensures ample time outside of the scheduled meetings for participants to converse. When the weather allows, a visit to the Notre Dame Observatory is usually planned. An evening banquet with a well-known speaker tops off the workshop and helps to make this biennial gathering much anticipated among historians of astronomy. Upcoming Workshop The Twelfth Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop is scheduled for 24-28 June 2015 at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and will include a one-day trip to the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Chicago. Further details about this upcoming workshop, including the call for session and individual proposals, will appear towards the end of 2014. Acknowledgments : Generous support for the workshop is provided by the Graduate Program in the History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Notre Dame, the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts (ISLA) in the College of Arts and Letters at the University of Notre Dame, along with the Adler Planetarium . 2014 University of Notre Dame.
