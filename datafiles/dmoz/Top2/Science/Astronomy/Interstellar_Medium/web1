 UCL Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics CCCP About the Centre The People Contact Us Our Publications Experimental Activites Theoretical Activities Astrochemical Modelling Resources AstroSurf Stars 'R' Us About the Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics The purpose of the Centre is to apply research to fundamental chemical processes which are believed to occur throughout the universe. A recent review of the activities of the Centre can be found here . Using a unique combination of theoretical and experimental techniques , such processes are investigated in the laboratory. Comparison of these results with astronomical models and observations serves to increase our knowledge and understanding of the cosmos. Our first major project concerns the formation of hydrogen molecules on surfaces of interstellar dust grains and the second expands upon this to study the formation of more complex molecules such as methanol. You can view a pdf document explaining the motivations and experimental activities of the centre here and we now have a resource available following our successful Stars 'R' Us display at the recent Royal Society Summer Exhibition. AstroSurf Network The members of the UCL Centre for Cosmic Chemistry and Physics are also members of the AstroSurf network . AstroSurf is a network which aims to bring together surface scientists (both experimental and theoretical) and molecular astrophysicists to encourage the application of surface science techniques to problems that are of relevance to astronomy. PhD Position Available A PhD project on surface chemistry in space has become available within the CCCP working with Dr Wendy Brown in the department of chemistry at UCL. A summary of the research project can be found here . 27 May, 2008 John Edridge +44 (0)20 7679 2000 - Copyright 1999-2007 UCL Disclaimer | Accessibility | Privacy | Advanced Search | Help 
 Welcome to the Universe of Astrophysical Molecules The illustration, taken from "Organic Molecules in the Interstellar Medium, Comets and Meteorites: A Voyage from Dark Clouds to the Early Earth", Pascale Ehrenfreund & Steven B. Charnley, Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics, 38:427-83, 2000   Carbon plays a very important role also in Space Astrochemistry . The interstellar clouds contain simple Carbonaceous molecules such as CO, formaldehyde, ether etc. but also more complex species like polyynes , Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , Fullerenes etc., which along with graphite and chains makeup for a large fraction of Interstellar Carbon. CO and Cyanide can be detected in young stellar objects. Amino acids and formic acid are detected in meteorites and comets. Biomolecules on Earth. [ Back to picture  /  Home page ] Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) PAHs can be present in neutral, ionized, hydrogenated or dehydrogenated forms depending on the Physical conditions of Astrophysical environment. [ Back to picture  /  Home page ] Carbon Chains and Polyynes Carbon chains are unsaturated organic linear molecules not seen on Earth because of their instability in our oxygen-containing atmosphere. They are cumulenes, polyacetylenes and cyanopolyynes (HCnN). These are detected in Interstellar medium via their rotational spectra, the largest being 13 atomic HC11N. The dense clouds contain polyynes and other organics like formaldehyde etc. [ Back to picture  /  Home page ] Fullerenes C60 Fullerenes or Buckyballs are large spherical football shaped extremely stable molecules made up of hexagonal and pentagonal Carbon structures. The most common is C60 but there are C70, C76, C84 and many more and Nanotubes. They are found not only in the dark clouds but also in terrestrial carbon rich rocks. The fullerenes and nanotubes have many unique properties . C60 shows superconducting properties with Alkali atoms. [ Back to picture  /  Home page ] Molecules of Biological importance Amino acids and Nucleic acids make up proteins and the RNA/DNA the building blocks of life as we know it on earth. RNA consists of one strand of nucleic acids linked together by phosphodiester bonds. The DNA molecule consists of two strands of nucleotides twisted together to form a double helix. The basic atomic units of such biomolecules formed in the stars. Molecules responsible for origin of life, it seems, already started forming in the interstellar medium.

Now, a dazzling collection of detailed views from the Hubble telescope reveals surprisingly intricate, glowing patterns spun into space by aging stars: pinwheels, lawn sprinkler-style jets, elegant goblet shapes, and even some that look like a rocket engine's exhaust. In this picture of M2-9, twin lobes of material emanate from a central, dying star. Astronomers have dubbed this object the "Twin Jet Nebula" because of the shape of the lobes. If the nebula is sliced across the star, each side appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines. Indeed, because of the nebula's shape and the measured velocity of the gas, in excess of 200 miles per second, astronomers believe that the description as a super-super-sonic jet exhaust is quite apt.
