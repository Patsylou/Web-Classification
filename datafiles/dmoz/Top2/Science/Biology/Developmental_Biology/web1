The program emphasizes basic research in the fields of genetics, cell biology and development through the use of model organisms such as yeast, Chlamydomonas , Arabidopsis , C. elegans , Drosophila , Dictyostelium , zebrafish and mice. There is also a strong group of faculty that study human genetic diseases including cancer, ataxia, muscular dystrophy, and immunologic deficiencies. Faculty members have appointments in various departments in the College of Biological Sciences, the Medical School, the College of Science and Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the School of Veterinary Medicine. Students begin their training in the Molecular, Cellular, Structural Biology (MCSB) graduate studies, a joint first-year program between MCDBG and Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics (BMBB). Students are able to explore the offerings of both programs for the first academic year before deciding on which program they would like to enter. MCDBG graduate students undertake state-of-the-art research and publish their research in prestigious journals. They have won nationally competitive pre-doctoral fellowships from the NIH, NSF and the American Heart Association.

The main purpose of Alpha is to facilitate the interchange of ideas and information between scientists, technologists, and technicians. The Alpha Board has decided that the topic for the third global Alpha Consensus meeting will be on establishing the minimum expectations for the professional status of the clinical embryologist. In doing this Alpha is not trying to dictate to regulators, but is certainly seeking to educate them in what makes clinical embryology a special and unique profession and how we must protect the interests of infertile patients around the world and strive towards ensuring they have equitable access to the best possible care and treatment.

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells." (More?

 The Visible Embryo is a visual guide through fetal development from fertilization through pregnancy to birth. As the most profound physiologic changes occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, these Carnegie stages are given prominence on the birth spiral. The shape and location of embryonic internal structures and how they relate and are connected to each other is essential to understanding human development. Medical professionals create a mental picture of this process in order to determine how well the fetus is progressing. It is also the basis of knowing how and when errors in development occur and if a possibility exists for a corrective intervention. Creating the images for The Visible Embryo, included capturing data from slides and three dimensional structures on fetal anatomy in The National Institutes of Health, Carnegie Collection of embryos , as well as from 3D and 4D ultra sound images.

Welcome. The Vanderbilt University Program in Developmental Biology offers a stimulating and supportive environment for researchers to study pattern formation, cellular differentiation and morphogenesis during the developmental process. Membership in the Developmental Biology Program is currently at 245 and includes researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, technicians and support personal across the School of Medicine and Arts Sciences campuses.  Program members utilize many different approaches in their attempt to answer developmental questions based on their particular field of study. This mixing pot of scientific disciplines has given our members the freedom to adopt an interspecies approach to their research. Some of the fundamental questions addressed by the researchers in our program are: How is the basic body plan of an embryo established? What are the factors that drive embryonic morphogenesis? How is a heart formed? How do neurons choose synaptic partners? As our members work to answer these questions they are encouraged them to participate in activities that are sponsored by the Program. These activities include: Didactic Courses Invited Guest Speaker Presentations and Meetings Weekly Developmental Biology Journal Club Seminars Monthly Developmental Biology Research Seminars Bi-monthly Student-Only Research in Construction Meetings Monthly Postdoctoral Fellows-Only Career Development Meetings BI-monthly Student and Postdoctoral Fellow Research Happy Hours Annual Scientific Retreat CONFERENCE ROOM AVAILABILITY The Program in Developmental Biology schedules the MRBIII Cell and Developmental Biology conference room for users outside of the department.

 Home Benefits Features Animations News About us Support Embryodynamics is a collection of 56 computer animations explaining the development of tissues and organs in the human embryo. Students, Professors, Universities, Health Professionals, and anyone interested in embryology, histology, anatomy or cell biology can greatly benefit from Embryodynamics animations. Embryodynamics presents fetal development several times, often under different levels of magnifications and in 2D or 3D views . Animations also have visual effects to virtually peel tissues , cut through organs , see through complex tissues systems, zoom , and rotation . Rarely found elsewhere, Embryodynamics animations can also include side-by-side illustrations of malformations, thus providing complete coverage of each organ.

Most textbooks only illustrate the beginning and terminal stages and fail to depict the intermediate stages. In order to facilitate the comprehension of embryological dynamics, I started producing computer-aided animations for my lectures and, encouraged by the positive feedback from my students, I continued to animate all of my lectures dealing with embryology. Embryodynamics animations are available for medical, veterinary, and biology students and professors as well as for anyone who is interested in embryology. Embryodynamics complements the descriptions provided in embryological textbooks, as every important chapter of normal human development, including corresponding malformations, is animated to accelerate learning and understanding of embryology.
