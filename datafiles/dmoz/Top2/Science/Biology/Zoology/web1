 T h e P a g e Educating and inspiring since 1997 Some amazing photos of bioluminescence are going around the web, but they do not show a red tide of dinoflagellates. This is a mass stranding of ostracods, probably Cypridina [=Pyrocypris] dentata according to Jim Morin. A meeting about fireflies is being organized for August 11-15, 2014 in Gainesville, Florida. Get all the details on the symposium website . There are two exhibits about bioluminescence that are currently on display. GLOW: Living Lights is at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and Creatures of Light is at the Field Museum in Chicago. A review paper covering recent research on bioluminescence has been published. The web site for the mysterious Bioglyphs art project using bacterial bioluminescence is back online! The Monterey Bay Aquarium also has a Jellyfish Exhibit featuring bioluminescence and fluorescence. An early book by E. Newton Harvey, one of the pioneers of bioluminescence research, is now available for download at Project Gutenberg . Have you spotted a red tide or high levels of bioluminescence? Report it at the jellywatch site. We have added a new section describing the many functions that bioluminescence serves in the sea, and updated the tree of life . Our Mail Bag section is currently online. Here we post answers to questions that have been sent to us over the years. Read more about the site and see some of the other pages linking to us at the bottom of the About page Bioluminescence is simply light produced by a chemical reaction which originates in an organism. The deep-sea fish Aristostomias amazing adaptations . (Illustration Steven Haddock) here .) Bioluminescence has evolved many times in many taxonomically distinct species in the sea as evidenced by the several distinct chemical mechanisms In these organisms in serves many functions , some of which have not yet been explored.

Zoology is the integrative study of animal biology Research and teaching in the MSU Zoology Department explores a wide range of biological questions in a diverse array of species, using cutting edge techniques in both the field and the laboratory. We are unified by an emphasis on integration across levels of biological organization, and by our recognition of the explanatory power of evolutionary theory in understanding biological complexity. This integrative perspective helps unify researchers in modern biological subdisciplines, including cellular and developmental biology, neurobiology, animal behavior, ecology, evolution, and environmental science.

The Department -- The Zoology Department has 25 faculty, about 180 undergraduate majors, and nearly 70 graduate students and post-docs. The departmental home is Cordley Hall, along with Botany Plant Pathology, the Biology Program, and the Environmental Science Program. Physically linked to Cordley Hall by sky bridges are the Agricultural and Life Sciences Building and Nash Hall, which house most of the other life science departments on campus . These include Biochemistry and Biophysics, Horticulture, Microbiology, and Fisheries and Wildlife. Graduate study in the biological sciences is rounded out by an interdisciplinary Molecular and Cell Biology Program and by the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing. Shared facilities within this three-building complex include an electron microscope service facility, the Central Services Laboratory (state-of-the-art molecular biology equipment and services, plus access to off-campus monoclonal antibody facilities), computer facility, several types of invertebrate and vertebrate breeding facilities, green houses, and separate research museums of entomology, botany, and vertebrates. Off campus teaching and research facilities include the Hatfield Marine Science Center on Yaquina Bay, a desert research field station at Malheur , and a forest ecosystem site in MacDonald Forest. Cordley Hall is also home to the Oregon State Arthropod Collection , the largest repository of Pacific Northwest insects in the world. Read about Robert "Doc" Storm , as featured in Copeia .
