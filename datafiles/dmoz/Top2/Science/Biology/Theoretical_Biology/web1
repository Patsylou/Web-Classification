He uses a combined approach based on computational modelling and quantitative imaging to address problems ranging from the multicellular to the molecular level, such as: a) How do chemical signals organise the collective motion of cells in developmental processes ( Computational models of Dictyostelium morphogenesis )? Adaptation of Dictyostelium cells to a uniform upshift of chemoattractant, or reorientation of cells in response to alternating shear flows )? Quantitative analysis and computational modelling of actin networks, patches, waves and leading edges )? To address these questions the development of imaging software for the automated analysis of large cell populations becomes increasingly important. Recently the analysis of high-throughput video-microscopy data has been extended to study temporal profiles of gene expression at the single cell level.

 skip to main skip to sidebar Exploring the world of biological research through the eyes of an outsider. Wednesday, 23 April 2008 It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it. Reference Nykter, M., Price, N.D., Aldana, M., Ramsey, S.A., Kauffman, S.A., Hood, L.E., Yli-Harja, O., Shmulevich, I. (2008). Gene expression dynamics in the macrophage exhibit criticality. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105 (6), 1897-1900. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0711525105 Please don't hate me for covering a paper from the Proceedings of the National Acadamy of Sciences (PNAS). They may have deeply dubious refereeing practices, but they remain a prestigous publisher and somehow their impact factor continues to hover over the heads of most other journals. This paper is a bit of a shark. It looks quite innocuous on the surface, but beneath the surface lurks a neat portent, a harbinger of the shape of things to come and that's why I've chosen to blog about it. The authors argue that the networks of interacting genes, proteins, rnas and biomolecules that mediate signalling within and between macrophage cells is critically poised, sitting happily on the boundary between ordered and disordered phases. Such systems are well studied within physics and their behaviour has formed the field of critical phenomena . The authors argue that critical systems conserve information over a time course and so by testing whether the networks conserve information, we can infer whether they are critical. If this were convincingly shown, it would be a real first and would have implications for many cell types. It would probably also get them a Nobel prize. But it's really not clear whether we can turn this relationship on its head and say that if critical systems conserve information, information conserving systems must be critical. For example, the level of information in random noise would also be conserved even though it would be zero. No doubt the PNAS' toothless refereeing practices haven't helped here. Steve 03:55 Tuesday, 11 March 2008 Strictly Bucky-Ballroom The latest affirmation of our nerdiness was the Dance Your PhD contest in Vienna, in which researchers try to convey their research results using the medium of modern dance. Performers were divided between three separate classes: students, postdocs and professors and the performances included a tango representing the amalgamation of galaxies and a tap dance describing post-translational regulation of mRNA. The classification seems oddly unnecessary. You wouldn't think that a long research career would be much of an advantage in the choreography of your performance. As a publicity exercise, the contest has clearly scored highly (covered by Science , The Telegraph and The Guardian ) but it clearly doesn't help those of us wanting to convey to the public the normality of a research career. And as for it's artistic merit, I'll let you be the judge of that ( performance videos Steve 14:39 Thursday, 21 February 2008 Suicide is painless, it brings on many changes... Cho et al . The authors use first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to show how the protein TNFa (Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha) triggers a sequence of protein interactions that lead to the release of NFkb (Nuclear Factor-kappa-beta), a bound group of proteins heavily involved the response of the immune system. NFkb activity is closely associated, for example, with inflammation and cell termination (known as apoptosis ). The pathway is written as a series of chemical reactions where each reaction is catalysed by an enzyme. These reactions can be described using the law of mass action , which says that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentration of the reactants. In a chain of reactions, the products of each reaction combine with other reactants to fuel further reactions and the behaviour of the whole chain is heavily dependent on the reaction rate constants. If they're too mismatched the pathway can swell with proteins in the middle or be starved of fuel. This picture is complicated by the recycling of the enzymes and the reverse reactions which accompany only part of the catalysis process. What makes this sort o f modelling challenging is that so few of the rate constants are known. To quote Cho et al ., " T he exact value of parameters, such as the concentration of each signaling protein, the rate constants for the generation and degradation, etc., are difficult to obtain because their numerical values not only depends on the species and tissue, but also on the physiological state of the cells/organism. " So the rate constants used are just educated guesses. Nonetheless, Cho et al . show that by adding a dollop of TNFa to the pathway, it leads to a surge in the amount of NFKB produced. The two plots shown are taken from their paper. The first shows the dose of TNFa (pure dashed line) at time zero and the second shows the NFKB response (pure solid line), which gets into its stride at about 50 seconds. It is clear from their results that TNFa plays an powerful role in triggering the immune response. Reference Cho, K. (2003). Investigations Into the Analysis and Modeling of the TNFÂ -Mediated NF-Â B-Signaling Pathway. Genome Research, 13 (11), 2413-2422. DOI: 10.1101/gr.1195703 Steve 11:09 Monday, 11 February 2008 I am a model, you know what I mean (and I do my little turn on the catwork) macrophage cell and it's been an eye-opening experience. Once its complete, we will learn volumes about the role of cholesterol in the immune system. But at this stage, just working out the angles has been fascinating. The challenges don't come from the directions you might think. At first, I thought they'd be computational. People have been modelling pathways for years, so I reasoned that all the straight forward work must have been done. In established fields, the new challenges come from the projects that push computing power to its limit, so I assumed that ours must have been computationally complex. But it turns out that this isn't the case. Few trusted models of signalling pathways exist and those that do are quite simple, so they are pretty straight forward to simulate. If the challenges weren't computational, then I thought they might surround model validity. A living cell is a complex beast. So much is happening inside that to isolate one pathway, without including any others, is a risky business. Doing so might invalidate the results of the model. Well, in some cases this might be true, but the real problems occur before we get a chance to see. The true obstacles aren't computation or simplification, they're come from something much more old-fashioned. People. When you dig into the papers, you find that genes and proteins have been given a bunch of different names by different research groups and each name can have a bunch of different abbreviations. This makes them hard to cross reference. The papers aren't stored in any single central database, but across many databases and they aren't catalogued or indexed in a friendly way. This makes them hard to find. The papers rarely systematically explore pathways, so the proteins they describe tend to freely appear and disappear as they are needed. This makes their behaviour hard to describe. Steve 06:27 Saturday, 2 February 2008 Ground control to Major Tom. In the last post, I mentioned that I work on exploring the complex network of interactions between genes, proteins and microRNAs that mediate a cells response to its environment. This field is known as cell signalling and the possible routes through the network are signalling pathways. To give you an example of how a typical pathway might work, suppose a cell is attacked by a virus. The virus might emit a protein that the cell, over millions of years of evolution, has learned to recognize as indicative of that threat. In this case, it will have evolved so that the viral protein binds to another protein on the cell surface, triggering a cascade of protein-protein and protein-gene interactions within the cell. The triggering happens because the binding causes a third protein to detach from the interior of the cell surface, which then floats off into the cell interior. Along the way it interacts with many other proteins in a huge variety of ways. For example, it might bind to another protein in such a way that causes the bound pair migrate towards the cell nucleus, before binding to a third protein that allows the bound state to pass into the nucleus. Once there, the three bound proteins could separate and one could then bind to a different protein, causing the travelling protein to change its configuration. After the change, the reconfigured protein might detach itself and bind to a gene, instigating the manufacture of a new protein. Perhaps the new protein binds to another gene, triggering the production of another new protein and, as the last link in the chain, this protein could be shuttled to the cell surface in order to help with the fight against the virus. Whilst this is a wildy hypothetical example, its also wildy over simple. Real pathways are much more complicated. The reality is that they contain ten times to a hundred times more proteins and genes and exploit feedback to create complex patterns of signals. Studying these signals is complicated further by the dramatic interweaving between different pathways. Cell's don't conveniently mediate their signals with a set of distinct pathways, insulated from each other. The various pathways have a significant overlap and for a given triggering protein, there will be many stimulated pathways. All this makes it damn hard to study what's going on in a cell. At the outset, you have no clue about how the network or pathways works and its only through expensive and time consuming experiments that this picture can be put together, literally one link at a time. The whole process is like trying to assemble a 10,000 piece jigsaw with no picture on the box. But despite the overwhelming scale of the challenge, we persevere because there is the potential to exploit the pathway structures to develop extraordinary medical therapies. By understanding these tapestries of pathways, we can learn how to correct the malfunctions cause disease. This will lead us to better designed treatments that have a maximised impact on the ailment with a minimised number of side effects. Viva la revolution! If you'd like to read more about cell signalling, here's a good review in Nature. Steve 11:07 Sunday, 27 January 2008 So what's it all about (Alfie)? Systems Biology reflects this ambiguity. Naturally, with researchers eager to make the most of their work, the banner has been subject to a little abuse, but such is life. Really, it's about understanding the behaviour that emerges when you put together a network of biological interactions. This can be on almost any scale, from the study of epidemics to the analysis of cellular biochemistry and the work that I do sits at the small end of this spectrum. We try to get to grips with how the cell works in terms of its constituent genes, proteins and RNAs. Actually, this isn't strictly true. We work on one specific cell, the macrophage , part of the immune system, and we study only one part of its function. Steve 05:34 Wednesday, 28 November 2007 Carry on Conferencing That's on the face of it. If you look below the surface, you see slightly more. Most attendees combine this exchange with a skillful level of political cunning. People will cosy up to potential reviewers, if they are about to submit a manuscript, or try to establish reputations, if they're thinking of changing their position. In fact, many would say that the need for political manoeuvring is really what drives most conferences. Needless to say, you gain the most insight into this at the bar. In fact, the more conferences I go to, the more I see the bar as providing the most important sessions to attend, particularly on the night of the conference dinner. When people are relaxing, are less inhibited and arguably have their guard down, you can learn a great deal. Far more than any amount of chit-chat over tea and biscuits will ever tell you. I've learned a lot in the bar at my last few conferences, but it's a dangerous game to play. A few too many drinks and you end up loosing more than you gain. And for nothing, you'll have to navigate your way through the rest of the conference with a hangover.

Science now recognizes  these extreme events as beneficial natural disturbances, essential to maintaining a mosaic of dynamic, heterogeneous habitat types that support many species having different  environmental requirements and thereby sustaining the high biological productivity and ecological integrity of rivers ......................   In short, from an ecological perspective floods are not disasters in a sense that human society typically views them. Through destruction, floods rejuvenate river ecosystem by maintaining dynamic ecological structure and function.

From:  ISMCBBPR ____________________________________________________       Note: Other Pioneering findings are up there Theoretical Findings #1- One of my (Isidro T. Savillo) pioneering theoretical discoveries is the  "Impermanence of  Sexual Phenotypes for both Plants and Animals."  This finding has been published (2010)  and was supported by my previous publication (on animals-2003)  where I made a pioneering  statement (2003) ahead of others (2009). Having this in mind, I also  made a statement on  the impermanence of sexual phenotypes on plants. New surprising result (not included in  my publication)  such as the capability of  sexual phenotype change in  Nephelium   lappaceum   would indicate the big possibility that sexual phenotype change can occur in other  plants  given the proper conditions- genetic, environmental,etc. According to a multi- awarded  world famous  CALTECH*  professor and scientist, this [work of mine] speaks for itself and would  need no further [elaboration][from him].10/2012.  My sincere thanks. *Congratulations to CALTECH as the best research university in the world 2012-2013!

If Genes could or would not change and be expressed  with various factors around it (biotic and abiotic) as an epigene , then the epigene could definitely  change by itself too- not necessarily dependent on the gene and its internal environment but also  being influenced by the external environment. Therefore to be able to survive successfully there  is the polishing of the epigenes  for the most capable of existence. Can Natural Selection be an  epigenetic factor? But to be fair epigene could not be without the DNA or the gene... therefore it  is time to unite the two theories.   10/27/2013``Epigenes: How fast (by seconds, years etc.) are the phenotypes (cellular to organismal/cellular) produced/realized by an epigene after the epigenetic interactions with the gene in question took place?  Theoretical Finding # 3- Redefinition of Modified Leaves ( online) At UCLA Conference Center              A colleague [from Czech] in BGBM- FU Berlin                 At the background is the City of SFO  At  Lake Arrowhead, CA, USA           gave me this photo- September in Berlin-                     California, USA (smiling with shades)  Taken by my american colleague  whose  group was nominated for a Nobel Prize.   _______________________________________ 10/27/2012- I have tried to find solutions of having a standard  for raising children (where it will lead to an all through out satisfaction per se)  but it is as difficult as anyone  could think about. Probably, this is just  clashes of the minds- where both minds don't meet at levels of needs. I can call these as the philosophical interventions but whether this may  have a genetic bearing, I still would espouse the environment - the proper one as superior  over the genes and a much better way of exacting standard for raising your specific kids.  As a Theoretical Biologist in the Theoretical Biology Directory ~ (2008) "Epigenetics and Savillo's theory on the influence of exogenous and endogenous environments  (2002-2003) to gene expressions are not far apart" a remembrance I bought right                          on the spot.

Back to normal life then... _______________________________________ JOKE For Each Day!!!   Hey Hey dude... Is this due to genetics or epigenetics?   12/06/08~ Just like any type of human behavior, the expectations of sexual behavioral  phenotype can be twisted by the environment and are not wholly genetically based. e lived the Longest by Dan Buettner (Wikipedia states that it is directly hard wired from the brain. Seem autonomic- like).  And it's good to come back to it. Anything that an organism do is environmentally  influenced like in animal courtship, in breathing, in standing up for the ist time as  observed in complex lower form of animals, etc. It's a cascade mechanism of signals  initiated by birth- just like the bloating of the lungs once the fetus is out of her mom's  placenta that will initiate lung- breathing reflexes. The biophysical influence of the  environment here is working. So much more in lower forms of animals way of standing up ....the muti- interactions of organ systems such as the circulatory system, the extension  mechanisms of the limbs and the bodies ripe need* for oxygen will drive the animal to stand... and the smell of milk will lead to his sucking needs or her mom's intimate* "signals".  Environmental influence can either be intrinsic (within the organism) or extrinsic  (outside of the organism) but the best answer is both. Well human babies are the  lowest graded when it comes to environmentally influenced reactions independent  of parents compared to complex lower forms of animals. Human babies are slaves  to philosophies of their caretakers until they grow to be what they are as influenced  in toto (by the enviroment and their genes).  They just can't do things on their own.  Not only they inherit the culture of their caretakers but also their caretakers'  economic status because of too much dependence since birth. to get up for air; a mother hen could no longer recognize the chick that she hatched  so she pecked on the poor being.. so the chick will make the human caretaker as imprint "mom" whenever the caretaker feed the chick or wherever the caretaker goes the chick follows. (up to graduate programs) with that of the growth and development of the human  being.

We need for more specific findings on the Genes for Visual  Likeness and Dislikeness(e.g. behavior in sexual phenotypes) to know why organisms  including humans visually behave that way. specifically on a moderate level in order to attain genuine satisfaction and real happiness.  Too little or too much of anything is unhealthy biologically. ~I.

But these are the basis of future bodily catastrophes. To own  a genomic profile with a layman's explanation may help protect the individual  with proper physiological and environmental treatments thus lessen suffering  and may extend survivality." by Isidro T. Savillo, 8/28/2005 cellular bearings or support are never scientific. They are just guesses or  hypotheses, products of sensual observations and surveys, dependent on the  ficklemindedness of the respondents and shamefully, such researches are considered for the highest achievement. They are phenotypes, phenotypes, phenotypes.... without the genes, cells and molecules with their respective environmental interactions, importantly, responsible for the production of such phenotypes. 5/2007  ~I. Savillo beginning to take root with the continuous process in the meticulous analyses of genomic profiles of the human individuals. A certain individual has "billions  of bad genes" and these are continuously growing. Their expressions may be direct, environmentally induced, semi- lethal, or whatever  (as long as they are expressed), niched in various biochemical pathways  or solitary. So, too the good genes and these are also continuously growing. Another individual has "billions and a one bad genes" and these are  continuously growing so too with his good genes. At the onset of late adulthood,  there will be "trillions of bad genes" and less good genes eventually leading to mortality. At a certain point in time in a specific dimension, there is an equality of the expressions of these bad and good genes but the process  of adding and subtracting would make ones list longer than the other and later a vice versa but as this is of similar ruling to all humans, then there is still a basis for equality. With the continuous growth of molecular and cell biology, no bad or good gene be missed for correction or improvement.  Appropriate environmental and physiological treatments are beginning to  be felt with the advent of personalized medicine. THEN, why discriminate  oneself? Why loose confidence? When every human is a bunch of more  bad than  good genes (that's why it leads to death). An astute geneticist  can identify  dozens of bad genes by just one look at the individual. A  genomic  profile  will give one a reason to make as many personal insults  to anyone  including  his next generations. Then, why are these people  behaving as  if they are superior than the others. I find it useless and  meaningless.  *Prof. Isidro T.

We are in an emergency state.  We need to  repair, establish, maintain a lot of ecosystems in order to survive during  the perturbations of  climate change. The more multitasking, the more -in expertise an  individual is, the more  lives can be saved. Climate Change is an era not just for a couple of years. Last May  2011,  NAS USA released a new statement (May 12, 2011)  (sent to me by NAS USA)  which is  America's Climate Choices- it is high time to take serious  look at what are the best choices for you, me or us in order to protect us from, ways of adapting to  or mitigating  climate change. We need to find and practice the best choices.  -  In addition, I cited a  statement from an author in my future international  keynote speech  that "change in climate  inflicts faster than the species can adapt"- so considering that we would like to repair the  life cycle of a commercial species that was affected by climate change,  in such an urgent  situation we need new and immediate ample knowledge to bring back  the ambient qualities  of that particular ecosystem so the species can later complete its life  cycle favorably and  continuously give food to an executive or a molecular biologist sitting in a towering  building.

In any situation they may be friends [to humans as pets*] except when they are   “on heat” or has something to do with reproduction but these pesky responses can also be alleviated.  In my observation, animals in nature are not “wild”. [As to my experience in one african country,  the wild birds in abundance can nest in your tomato plants-- or might as well say "treat humans  just like any wild animals in the field".] They only become such["wild"] when they receive unfriendly  treatments from humans common in civilized settings.

Savillo An Introduction to SYSTEMS BIOLOGY are focused to the minute analyses of the cellular and molecular mechanisms  which are the pillars of structural, behavioral and physiological  phenotypes that our lives are seated upon. phenomenal existence of the GENE. Can the Gene be expressed without  being influenced by its environment? How "constitutive" are the  constitutive genes? In my paper, "The Overpowering Influence of the  Environment to Gene Expression," I introduced the earth as a  "biological incubator" for all living organisms. The abiotic components  of the environment are essential for its "incubatory" mechanisms for  our genes/cells  to function though the optimal range is broad for most.  I introduced two types of  environment: the exogenous and endogenous  environments. The exogenous  environment may be an abiotic or  a biotic product influencing the individual. Thus, it  may come from  the chemicals, heat, etc. or someone else's genes. The endogenous  environment comprise of physical factors (e.g. temperature, hydration, pressure, etc)  which may be independent of the genes but if not for the exogenous environment,  they could not have been a part of the cellular metabolism. Most of the endogenous  environments are products of the genes of the individual and the physical factors which are produced as a result of it or by their various biochemical interactions. of the abiotic exogenous environments we are in and how it managed to  allow  both the biotic and abiotic exogenous environmental factors to further influence  the endogenous environment for the expression of genes. queries which target the specificity of the genes. Are genes strong enough to defy  environmental influences? Do we have to adjust to the needs of our genes?  Our genes respond to any environmental influences and this would eventually  lead to the death or survival of the organism. Considering that our genes have the imperfect components, adjusting to the needs of our genes may help but  putting up a perfect environmental condition is impossible. The interactions of  various environmental factors are affecting various biochemical pathways or  evolving into one/many new pathways and specifically adjusting the numerous  exogenous and endogenous environments for these is difficult to attain. Genes  could  specifically produce phenotypic characteristics but in the presence of  certain types  of endogenous and exogenous environments, there may be some  forms of confusion leading to erroneous genetic products. In developmental biology, there are many  cellular and molecular interactions of non indigenous substances to  the cells of the embryo. Thus, the embryo is floating to new mixes of substances  which are not  the products of his own genetic materials. This could   contribute  to the modification of his phenotype. When it comes to sexes, I posed a question, Is there permanency in sexual phenotypes? How about the clones and the monozygotic  twins? It's time to stop saying that "they are phenotypically similar because they are  genotypically the same." How about "instincts?" Are there really instincts or are they  slaves  to environmental pulses or signals? In terms of behavioral analyses, what is  missing?# The molecular bridge from the exogenous environment to the  senses (via the endogenous environment) is one of those cellular and molecular  mechanisms that could eventually make out a complete picture of behavior which  had been usually gathered through observations and surveys. I have to introduce a  new field of  "Molecular Sociology Philosophy "to satisfy this option of in toto  comprehensive analyses. Absolutely, inherited genes are difficult to change. Can  you change your height or your looks? Thus, we live with it. If we have to change  a certain part of our phenotype, we  call that as "cosmetic genetics." The problems  of maintenance come in. It was not a part  of the familiarization processes of the  embryonic cells and new adjustments could rarely be recognized by the adult cells. Because one has a defective gene, it doesn't mean that  the environment has nothing  to do with it. But the environment is superior in allowing the gametes to fertilize  and produce an individual with a defective gene. Defective genes are important to  evolution. The wobbling of the nitrogenous bases will allow the most  adjusted  (depending on the appropriate protein structures called upon by the new environment) species to survive and reproduce. What about culture? Culture controls phenotype  evolution or expression and may not be favorable for some. These are just a few  of the major constructions I would like to work into as Part I of my research studies.  I think there is a need to change old knowledge for new or modify them to some extent. Once a theory is firmly established, it will  be subjected to molecular  (mathematical/biological) modelling. The pioneering knowledge taken from  these analyses are important for the betterment in the understanding of  ourselves in the  molecular and cellular levels.   "As a Psycho- analyst, I study all statements along the way and analyze how friendly they are to me when it remains as is rather than further exploit it." by Isidro T. Savillo 12/10/2012 How to beat an obsessive trodden emotion? Emotions are as varied as the proteins of the cell. They could assume several functions  and come out with a tiring but/or exciting kaleidoscopic manifestations of a persona. Obsessive wants are unrealistic and difficult to acquire in most instances. To get away with this behavioral thinking- one has to formulate a scene where the major protagonist is focused and weave a make believe story where at the end the overall conclusion is a neutral aspect of all parties concerned. In this manner obsession is lessened or lost.  By re- enacting this make believe story in ones mind a number of times so as to make it appear as if "realistic", this will lead to lessening memory retention for the protagonist and may soon remove the disturbing emotional kinks brought by obsessive thinking. by Isidro T.
