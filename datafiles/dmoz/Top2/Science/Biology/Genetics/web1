And the more we learn about how they work, the more ethical, legal and social issues we face. SoundVision Productions is produced by an experienced team at SoundVision Productions, IncÂ®. More The DNA Files was an award-winning series of radio programs hosted by John Hockenberry and guided by an outstanding panel of advisors . From 1998 to 2007 SoundVision researched and produced 19 one-hour radio programs, exploring not only the science of genetics, but its ethical, social and legal implications.

 2010 Symposia Human Variation Human Variation: Cause and Consequence EMBL Advanced Training Centre, Heidelberg, Germany Sunday 20 June - Wednesday 23 June 2010 Download Poster The goal of this Symposium is to explore human genetic and phenotypic variability in the light of recent developments in genomics, genetics and molecular medicine. The topics covered will include the mechanisms of mutation, normal sequence variation from the DNA to the chromosomal level, functional polymorphism and disease genetics. Keynote Lectures will be delivered by Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and KÃ¡ri StefÃ¡nsson, deCODE genetics.

Unfortunately, next-generation workflows tend to be complex, time-consuming, and costly to perform. And â despite the increased efficiency of these systems, they still lack the ability to target specific areas of interest for sequence interrogation. With the SureSelect Target Enrichment System, only the genomic areas of interest are sequenced, creating process efficiencies that reduce costs and allow more samples to be analyzed per study. Reducing the amount of DNA being interrogated also allows investigators to perform experiments with more statistically relevant numbers of samples. The main objective of this course is to provide hands-on training in library preparation and target enrichment required for next-generation sequencing.
