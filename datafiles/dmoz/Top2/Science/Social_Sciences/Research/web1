Feb 5, 2014 Report 3614159-college-instructor-234px.jpg Changing Staffing and Compensation Patterns in Higher Education Skyrocketing college tuitions and trillion-dollar student loan debt have put college and university spending in the spotlight. "Labor Intensive or Labor Expensive? Changing Staffing and Compensation Patterns in Higher Education," a new report by the Delta Cost Project at AIR, finds that colleges and universities increasingly rely on part-time faculty to meet instructional demands and rein in costs, but rising benefit costs and increased hiring for other types of positions have undercut those savings. Topic: Education , Higher Education , School Finance Feb 21, 2014 Video Hansen video still.jpg Long Story Short: Which Matters More, Class Size or Teacher Quality? Many people assume that smaller classes lead to more individualized instruction and hence to better student achievement. But do they? In this 90-second video interview, Michael Hansen, senior researcher at AIR, argues that's not always the case. Topic: Education , Teacher and Leader Effectiveness Feb, 2014 Project drop-outs.jpg Understanding Americas College Drop-Out Population Over 40% of full time four-year college students fail to earn a bachelorâs degree within six years, and many never complete their education. This CALDER Center paper finds that if students who dropped out from four-year institutions started college at a two-year school, their chances of earning a degree would be much higher.
