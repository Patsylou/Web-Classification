Il vise plus particuličrement ŕ rassembler, ŕ générer et ŕ diffuser les informations nécessaires ŕ la compréhension de l'évolution de la ville intérieure montréalaise, et ŕ proposer des solutions novatrices aux problčmes reliés ŕ l'aménagement des espaces souterrains comme les ruptures avec le milieu d'insertion, les difficultés d'orientation spatiale, en particulier pour les usagers occasionnels, et les défis de la coordination dans les mesures de sécurité. The Observatoire was created to connect the work of researchers and administrators, in both the public and private sectors, who have a stake in the development of indoor spaces in the urban landscape. More specifically, it aims to collect, contribute to, and disseminate information leading to a better understanding of the development of Montreal's indoor city, and to bring forward new solutions to pervasive problems associated with the planning of urban underground space such as discontinuties with the surrounding built environment, difficulties in wayfinding, especially for occasional users, and challenges in the coordination of security measures.

The concept and the management structures that support it are frighteninly new, with untested implications that make this form of housing nothing less than an enormous social experiment.

Its research is intended to be directly relevant to the localities where it works as well as anyone interested in urban development and neighborhood life. Urbanology is defined as the understanding of incremental developmental processes and daily practices in any given locality through direct engagement with people and places. The institute contributes to the debate on urban development by engaging with local community groups, creating new concepts, implementing projects and recommending strategies and policies. The Institute sharpened its methodology through years of fieldwork in New York, Bogota, Tokyo, Istanbul, New Delhi, Goa and Mumbai. It has offices in Dharavi, Mumbai and Aldona, Goa. In Dharavi, the Institute studies homegrown practices in the fields of housing, artisanship and trade, and physical and theoretical spaces where these fields converge. In Goa, it looks at the transforming role of villages within larger economic, cultural, ecological and urban systems. The Institute of Urbanology regularly organizes seminars and workshops that bring together local actors, activists, artists, architects and urbanists. It uses art, architecture, story telling, and other creative means of expression to stimulate debates and intervention in the urban realm. It uses the web as well as live events to document, convene, produce and diffuse diverse modes of development.
