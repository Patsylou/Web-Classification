COUNTRY CLUSTERS: STATISTICALLY SIMILAR COUNTRIES IN NETWORK GRAPHS What would the world look like if you shifted countries around based on similarity? What if you clustered countries according to statistical performance, rather than other predefined groups, regions and associations? We did just that at NationMaster. We created network graphs where the most similar countries become neighbours. The more similar their statistical performance, the closer countries are. And if they're not that similar, we show no connection at all. (We tried showing more connections but then the graphs turned into big unreadable blobs). Statistically Similar Countries: All Indicators. Source: nationmaster.com This analysis doesn't directly take into account the kinds of institutions countries have or their cultural mix, just how they score in 4,000 different statistics. We chose to show only countries that had strong correlations, just so you could (almost) fit the graph on your screen. Exceptional countries like The United States often don't make an appearance for that reason. What you get is a new way of looking at countries. It's not just interesting. It helps us here think about how we should group countries. Below you see the graph for all indicators: You can see in the top left the West, and sub clusters within them: some English speaking former British colonies ( Canada , NZ , Australia ), Scandinavia, Western Europe, Southern Europe. Below you see a nice cluster for former Warsaw Pact countries, with Slovakia being the most typical. At the middle bottom we have our middle income countries: a mix of South America with some South East Asia . In the bottom right hand corner of our map we see western Europe, with Southern Europe and Scandinavia in their own subclusters. Statistically Similar Countries: People Indicators. Source: nationmaster.com If you redrew the world map based on statistical similarity, South America and Asia would be neighbours and Japan would be in Scandinavia. For economic indicators Statistically Similar Countries: Economy Indicators. Source: nationmaster.com This is a tiny sneak peak into the new NationMaster we're building. We're recoding from scratch and are rethinking everything. Exciting times! comments WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING Thursday 20th February 2014 Gerei on However, recently was published an above mentioned book by Galy Yenikeyev, about the unwritten (hidden) real history of Tatars. There are a lot of previously little-known historical facts, as well as 16 maps and illustrations in this book. This book presents a new, or rather "well-forgotten old" information about the true history of the Tatars and other Turkic peoples. It must be said, that there Bernd Willimek on The most difficult problem in answering the question of how music creates emotions is likely to be the fact that assignments of musical elements and emotions can never be defined clearly. The solution of this problem is the Theory of Musical Equilibration. It says that music can't convey any emotion at all, but merely volitional processes, the music listener identifies with. Then in the process of identifying the volitional processes are colored with emotions. The same happens when we watch an exciting film and identify with the volitional processes of our favorite figures.

It seems it's not because they have too much leisure time . highest IQ's ? Use this one with caution. What proportion of each population are christian ? energy section is now jam packed with stats on production and consumption of everything from jet fuel to wind . 2010 internet usage figures. Did you know Iceland has 97.6% penetration? What are the other 2.4% doing, that's what I want to know. gay marriages , radar detectors and synthetic marijuana ? overweight women in the Middle East? comments (12) COMPARE ANY TWO COUNTRIES SIDE BY SIDE! India vs Pakistan and you learn that the Indians spend 31% more time in school and its economy is 9 times the size. Compare the American and Chinese economies and you can see the US has 5 times the GDP per capita of China today, but was 13 times more in 1973. See that Germany and France are quite similar except that Germany has double the emissions but France spent 77% more on the military. comments (20) UPDATED CRIME DATA! crime stats based on a UN-affiliated 2011 report , including data on rapes and robberies . We've also got figures for car production for 2010. World Bank's open data initiative , and we're currently working to import all that too, ensuring that the language is accessible as possible.

Continue reading South Sudan Crisis: A Summary December 26th, 2013 An AFSAAP member is following the South Sudan Crisis from Uganda.Â It appears that the conflict is seeded in the post John Garang arrangements in which power was reorganised in response to Garangs absence. It is suggested that the reorganisation process was ethnically influenced in which sections of the South Sudanese felt left out. For instance, the Dinka have been long accused of dominating the state in which corruption has taken root and reached dangerous levels. State governors have accused the central state for not remitting funding meant to ensure service delivery. Tension has always existed especially in the army, but this particular conflict is an extension of internal SPLA infighting which resulted into the recent suspension of the entire cabinet by President Kiir. Â Information out of Juba indicates that the attempted coup was ochestrated by forces loyal to the former Vice President including some governors. And that as of yesterday, the rebels had control of most of the oil producing region which also provides almost 90% of South Sudan state revenue.
