I recently attended an SF Globalization meetup event in San Francisco hosted by Airbnb . There, I saw localization (and UX) convention stood on its head by something anyone working in developer relations would be proud to evangelize about. It was a great event, dinner was provided for free, and I learned how Airbnb built international product. It was a Â story told with honest and candid insight by a multi-skilled team. Very refreshing views were heard, far too many to go into now. The Airbnb engineering team used Rails , instrumentingÂ a t()Â (translate) helperÂ method as the foundation of an infrastructure to deliver quality translations. The responses to audience questions, especially to the one if Airbnb used a translation memory, We use a normal SQL database, made me smile. I was immediately reading up more about the Rails i18n module . The t() solution was built to meet a need and to suit the Airbnb business model. It handles plurals, context, locale changes, and so on. Heres the t() method process overview: t() method used to build the Airbnb translation tool Heres how the tool provides context for translators, using screen shots: Screen shot capture in tool for translator context Its good for handling singular and plural and other language semantics, too: Singular and plurals in t() And of course, where would user experience be without enabling locale specifics: t() handles locale differences, such as terminology differences. The event also revealed that Airbnb relied on community translation and Google Translat e as a bootstrap translation tool, thats another days blog. I am indebted to the Airbnb team for the use of these images here. I cannot share all the slides shown in the meetup, but you can read more about theÂ  t() method and how it took Airbnb into the Japanese Â market. If you see Airbnb on the agenda at localization or UX industry events, check it out. Inspiring stuff. And, they must be doing something right, as theyre poised to become the worlds biggest hotelier Language in Business , Personalization and Design , Translation Technology and tagged AirBnB , Context , language semantics , localization , Rails , SQL on February 15, 2014 by ultan .         Localization Unconference Canadian Edition 1 Reply Oleksandr Pysaryuk ( @alexpysaryuk ) shares the insights on the organization, takeaways, and people from the Localization Unconference in Toronto. And what might be next On a chilly Ontario morning of January 23, Achievers office in Liberty Village in Toronto welcomed 43 localization enthusiasts to the first ever Localization Unconference in Canada. Those other ICE (In Context Exact) Matches The rules were no prepared presentations, no selling and â there is no spoon â?. We brought ideas and brainstormed, voted and discussed the usual suspects (machine translation, crowdsourcing, translation quality, localization and Agile), as well as new arrivals (developer tools for localization, distributed translation memories, identity theft in translation industry). Localization Unconference topics reflect the energy and enthusiasm for inquiry in the industry Some takeaways: Translators need context, just a different kind. Developers like to be world-class. Learn to speak developer language. Measure translation quality differently. Your localization and your Agile are unique to you. The unconference is keeping it pink and multilingual! I hear there might be the first unconference at the next OTTIAQ event in Montreal, in French. And one at Translation Forum Russia 2014 , in Russian. Special thanks to Teresa Marshall ( @pschesi ) for supporting the Localization Unconference in Canada and consulting the organizers.

Transifex: A Language Developers Understand Leave a reply Iâm hearing great things from software professionals about Transifex , a SaaS translation solution based in Silicon Valley. Â As I work in user experience developer relations, I Skyped in Dimitris Glezos Â ( @glezos ), Transifex founder and Chief Ninja, in Greece to find out more. Dimitrisâs background is in software development, Transifex originating as an open source project. The passions and principles of the FOSS development community, collaborating on a cloud-based platform , remain true today. Transifex knows how developers work in the cloud, and provides a user experience that makes sense to a world of GitHub , PaaS , Python gettext , RESTful APIs , Ruby , SaaS, and so on. Transifex has even been referred to as the GitHub of software translation , which is some accolade in the development community! Transifex API enables integration of software development workflows and tools in the cloud. The Transifex user community now has more than 100,000 developers and translators , working together on over 10,000 projects . Transifex users range from well-known enterprises to tech startups and the open-source community. Transifex can quietly boast of a diverse portfolio of successful translation projects ranging from hundreds millions of words of online courseware to strings for wearables and apps. A testament that Transifex is not a âone size fits allâ? model, what is really staggering about such a breadth of achievements is that it happened without Transifex having a single sales person , or offering those LSP-style â?. The Transifex platform is development friendly and flexible, tooling up small pockets of remote developers to build iterative, dynamic content using 24/7 workflows and lean software methodologies. Â Exceling with the detection of string changes and merging, Transifex is easily integrated into development environments through an API and command line interface. Â Transifex works upstream too, a string pseudo-translation capability enables developers to test their internationalization chops before starting translation. Transifex translators use a browser-based online editor . This user experience packs CAT capabilities , support for glossaries, collaborative tools, screenshot preview for context, and other cool features . Translation projects are overseen in a contemporary online dashboard experience (itâs translated, too). Transifex user dashboard view. The Â editor supports the major file types (including XLIFF and TMX ), has built-in QA for code variables in strings, enables character limits to be set, handles singular and plural variants, and makes it easy for developers and translators to work together. Transifex online translation editor user interface. âs translation the way developers want it, or the way they would have built it themselvesâ?, says Dimitris. Most large companies have figured out a translation process, but many now innovate rapidly with small teams using agile frameworks and donât want to build their own translation infrastructure. Developers are busy people who like to be productive , Â solving code problems using smart reusable solutions, and donât need extra work. âIt isnât easy to build a translation processâ?, says Dimitris, âInstead, Transifex is integrated into existing development tools and workflowsâ?. The Transifex success is based on an understanding of developers and translators and how they work, keeping both these users at the center of the user experience. An easy to use solution that seamlessly matches development processes and work styles with a community of online translators generates a powerful networking effect of kudos from satisfied users, who share their positive experiences with others. âIf developers love it, they talk about it!â? says Dimitris. Thatâs the sort of organically-generated Â customer experience that most can only aspire to, and money alone cannot buy. There are powerful lessons from Transifex Â about how software development teams and translators can work well together, not least of which is âknow your usersâ?. The Transifex story continues to unfold, and you can find out more about building international products using a SaaS platform in the case studies on the Transifex website . If you have other examples of cloud-based integrations of translation and software development teams, please Â share them in the comments.

Working Out Context in the Enterprise: Localize That! I just came across an interesting terminology issue for enterprise applications user experience and localization, generally. What should we call the people in an organization who do the work of the business and rely on software to help them do so? Honest labor. But honestly, what to call the person doing it! Image sourced from WIkiPedia Commons and also in public domain. Take the English language term worker appearing in a software applications user interface (UI). That term doesnt work well for every organizations set up or localized well into every language either. In some contexts, worker Â might mean someone who is involved in manual labor and is an individual contributor. It others it doesnt. Consider how that term worker be perceived by the manager of a team of people, or someone who performs work (actually, all workers use knowledge, so I always found that qualifier to be somewhat snotty)?Â Then, there are organizations that have corporate requirements Â about how they refer to, and manage, their workers, referring to them as employees, Â  partners , or something else. So, how could worker be easily localized into other languages given the challenges with the English term in the first place! I have seen localization bugs being logged for the Â term appearing in a localized UI. In some cases, that may be the case, but the cause, of course, could also be traced back to choice of English language source term and a lack of context or understanding about how it is used. Should we even bother with such a generic terms as worker , employee , partner , and so on, anyway? In a role-based access world of enterprise applications, perhaps job titles might be more suitable? But then, how would such an approach scale ? And, how could it account for an increasingly consumer-driven user experience of enterprise technology where notions of identifying and labelling different types of users doesnt apply. Then again, if its a role-based access implementation, then why bother mentioning someone by title in the UI and not just their profile sÂ real name? Then, theres that term user ; Â a term in wide use in the drug and software industry , but not elsewhere. What could user be replaced with? Customer ? Oh, lets not go there. Im confused enough! Ultimately, of course, this conundrum is really a question of context . Coming up with a common, generic term that suits every organization, with operations in many languages, and that spans all kinds of domains and expertise really is not possible. Mistranslations of course, can happen, and superior, generated context for translators to localize the source terms accurately will help alleviate problem that for sure. But, coming up with a source term that is broadly acceptable, applied sparsely in the UI, and easily adapted in context is the way to go. Enabling er, users, to change simply one term to another that suitsÂ  individual (through a personalization option) or organizational requirements (using a customization tool feature) seems a reasonable, consumer-driven approach that doesnt require an IT project or a translator to be on 24-hour standby either. One size doesnt fit all. Comments welcome. What do you call your workers or users ?

Correct Youse of English: Your Personal Dialect Map is Here Thought I was done with regional English ? No chance. The Irish Times recently predicted that the phrase â you guysâ? will soon be accepted as the new second-person plural pronoun in English . As a native Dubliner , I am very familiar with such evolution, the locals already having adoptedÂ â? and â? as replacements for the pronoun. As pointed out by Frank McNally in the Irish Times article, you can also hear the use of â? in south and the west of Ireland, and â? in the north of the country. Now,Â the New York Times has gone one further and used such dialect variants as , , Â you guys and more, and lots of other regional phrases too, as a way to gives a clue as to where you might be from based on how you speak. Ultans personal dialect map (Visualization generation copyright of The New York Times) The newspaper has created an interactive visualization tool using heatmaps overlaid on a map of the United States of America generated from your answers to some dialect-driven questions. You, too, can now create your own personal dialect map . Its fun! Although its a U.S.-based map, I was amazed to see how many phrases I was using regularly, even from places I had never been to (sorry Newark / Paterson andÂ  Yonkers ). Thats language evolution for youse. Try it yourself.

Â Physically based rendering has transformed computer graphics lighting by more accurately simulating materials and lights, allowing digital artists to focus on cinematography rather than the intricacies of rendering. First published in 2004, Physically Based Rendering is both a textbook and a complete source-code implementation that has provided a widely adopted practical roadmap for most physically based shading and lighting systems used in film production. I believe that this is the first time that an Academy Award has been given to a book. And this (ten-year-old) book was written in a way that deserves to be better known and more widely imitated. Read the rest of this entry Permalink Comments (34) More Metadata Muddles on Google Books Geoff Nunberg under Classification , Humor Mark's discovery of a mistitled Google Books entryâa book on experimental theater filed as a 2009 book on managementâis entertaining but not that unusual. Like the other metadata mixups at Google books (involving authorship, genre classification and publication date, among other things) that I enumerated in a 2009 post "Google Books: A Metadata Train Wreck," there are probably thousands of cases in which the metadata for one book is associated with an entirely different work. Or at least that's what induction suggests; Paul Duguid and I have happened on quite a number of these, some as inadvertantly comical as Mark's example. Clicking on the entry for a book called Tudor Historical Thought turns up the text of a book on tattoo culture, the entry for an 1832 work on the question of whether the clergy of the Church of England can receive tithes turns up a work by Trotzky, the entry for Last Year at Marienbad turns up the text of Sam Pickering's Letters to a Teacher , and so on (see more examples below the fold). What's particularly interesting about Mark's example, though, is that the work is similarly misidentified on Amazon and Abe Books, which indicates that for many modern titles, at least, the error is likely due not to "some (perhaps algorithmic) drudge on the Google assembly line," as Mark suggests, but to one of the third-party offshore cataloguers on which Google and others rely for their metadata.

The graphics intern who created the mapping algorithm, Josh Katz, was hired for a full-time position and Bert Vaux , the linguist who created the data for the test, began to see an uptick in the activity on his website. Vaux, a linguistics professor at Cambridge University in England, says when he started teaching at Harvard University in the early 1990s, he noticed a gradual change in the way his students spoke. He says that for the first couple of weeks, students displayed accents and used words that originated in certain parts of the country, but within several weeksâ time they had all adopted a standard form of American English that made it hard to identify what region they were from. So Vaux created a dialect survey that he distributed to his students where they would identify words they used in their native regions. He joins Here Now âs Robin Young to discuss his research.

An important part of this is the expression of gender, especially when it extends beyond the definitions of just â? or female.â? So today, weâre proud to offer a new custom gender option to help you better express your own identity on Facebook. Â  We collaborated with our Network of Support, a group of leading LGBT advocacy organizations, to offer an extensive list of gender identities that many people use to describe themselves. Moreover, people who select a custom gender will now have the ability to choose the pronoun theyâd like to be referred to publicly â male (he/his), female (she/her) or neutral (they/their). Â  We also have added the ability for people to control the audience with whom they want to share their custom gender. We recognize that some people face challenges sharing their true gender identity with others, and this setting gives people the ability to express themselves in an authentic way.
