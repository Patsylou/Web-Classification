FEI Titan dual aberration corrected S/TEM The Titan has a high speed remote control which removes even the operator from the instrument environment, a change that will be welcomed by most operators. The Sound of One Wing Flapping At Penn State, faculty in electrical and mechanical engineering and their graduate students have spent the past two years working at an even smaller scale than a nano air vehicle (NAV), called the pico air vehicle (PAV), based on insect flight. Bioinspiration, Biomimetics, and Bioreplication Three closely related ideas with different names make up one of the fastest growing fields in science and engineering. Microencapsulation produces uniform drug release vehicle Microencapsulation produces uniform drug release vehicle. Biomedical Materials and Devices Materials of all kinds, but especially nanomaterials, are being exploited for image enhancement, drug delivery, wound healing, electronic/photonic/fluidic devices for diagnosis and therapy, and regenerative medicine. Electronic/Photonic Materials and Devices New and still largely theoretical areas of research active at Penn State include plasmonics, spintronics, and metamaterials. Polymeric Systems Polymer research crosses many disciplinary boundaries, including chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, bioengineering, and medicine. Interdisciplinary Research at Penn State A strong group of faculty researchers are working across boundaries to solve important scientific and societal problems in five broad areas of interdisciplinary materials research. Nanomaterials, Nanostructures, and Nanofabrication At Penn State, nearly one hundred research groups are engaged in high-impact science and engineering at the nanoscale. Penn State is one of only 14 university members of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN). Penn State: Inspiring Researchers Nanoscience View how Jim Adair and his team at Penn State are tansforming the way we treat and detect cancer through their nanoscience research with a new drug delivery and imaging system utilizing nanojackets. Materials, Processes, and Tools At Penn State, we have faculty whose primary focus is metals, ceramics, glass, powder processing, laser welding, microwave processing, mechanical testing, materials characterization, modeling and simulation.

IMS operates and maintains extensive state-of-the-art instrumentation including a wide range of laboratories. Support facilities include an electronics shop and an instrument and machine shop. Over 100 faculty members from twenty departments including the UConn Health Center are affiliated with IMS, contributing to the Institute’s interdisciplinary research programs. Primary disciplines represented are chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, polymer science, pharmacy, molecular and cell biology, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, biomaterials, and biosciences. IMS supports over 100 graduate students in three primary fields of study, Materials Science and Engineering, Polymer Science, and Materials Science. In addition, graduate students in affiliated departments use IMS facilities to perform materials-related research. The Institute is also home to the Industrial Affiliates Program, an industry outreach program which assists Connecticut companies in their research and development efforts to improve new and existing products. The Industrial Affiliates Program provides many benefits for member companies, including access to facilities and faculty at UConn, short courses, and other resources that can assist in materials-related problem solving for industry. Industrial Affiliates Program Short Course: ‘Digital Alchemist’ Uses Computer to Design New Materials Serge Nakhmanson describes himself as a ‘digital alchemist.’ A former scientist with the Argonne National Laboratory, he specializes in the computer-based design and discovery of advanced multifunctional materials.
