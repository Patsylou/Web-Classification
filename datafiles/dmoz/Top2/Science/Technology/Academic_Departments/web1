It combines academic rigour with high quality applied research and uses a combination of academic, industry and defence experience to take a holistic approach to solving problems for the entire system development and deployment cycle. Our innovative research and high quality teaching and training is aimed at allowing the viability of complex new technologies, products, practices, infrastructure acquisitions and capabilities to be developed concurrently with the conception of new deployment and service approaches, and hence reducing project risk and total system cost. We maintain significant government and industry relationships with the Department of Defence, the Defence Science Technology Organisation (DSTO) and other key players in the Australian defence industry sector. We also maintain significant connections with a large number of SME’s in the non-defence sector. Our extensive collaborative relationships with universities and government research centres in the US, UK and Asia supports our leading edge research. Our postgraduate degrees (also offered online) are industry-relevant. We also offer short courses which can be customised to the needs of clients and delivered on-site or remotely. If you are interested in becoming involved with DASI as a future student, researcher or client, please contact us today.
