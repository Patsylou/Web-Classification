 Close Ad " Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot stay in the cradle forever! " --Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky-- Introduction by Mark Somers Another avenue being investigated is a concept of nano robotics called "Swarms". Swarms are nano robots that act in unison like bees. They theoretically, will act as a flexible cloth like material and being composed of what's called Bucky tubes, this cloth will be as strong as diamond. Add to this cloth of nano machines nano computers and you have smart cloth. This smart cloth could be used to keep astronauts from bouncing around inside their spacecraft while they sleep, a problem that arises when the auto pilot computer fires the course correction rockets. The cloth like material will be able to offset the sudden movements and slowly move the sleeping astronaut back into position. Still another application for the nano robot swarms, being considered, is that the smart cloth could be used in the astronauts space suits. -- Benjamin Franklin -- Updated March 20 2004 Copyright Mark Somers All Rights Reserved

That world is the field of nanotechnology, the realm of atoms and nanostructures. Nanotechnology i­s so new, no one is really sure what will come of it. Even so, predictions range from the ability to reproduce things like diamonds and food to the world being devoured by self-replicating nanorobots. In order to understand the unusual world of nanotechnology, we need to get an idea of the units of measure involved. A centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter, a millimeter is one-thousandth of a meter, and a micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, but all of these are still huge compared to the nanoscale. A nanometer (nm) is one-billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair [source: Berkeley Lab ]. As small as a nanometer is, it's still large compared to the atomic scale. An atom has a diameter of about 0.1 nm. An atom's nucleus is much smaller -- about 0.00001 nm. Atoms are the building blocks for all matter in our universe. You and everything around you are made of atoms. Nature has perfected the science of manufacturing matter molecularly. For instance, our bodies are assembled in a specific manner from millions of living cells . Cells are nature's nanomachines. At the atomic scale, elements are at their most basic level. On the nanoscale, we can potentially put these atoms together to make almost anything. In a lecture called Small Wonders:The World of Nanoscience, Nobel Prize winner Dr. Horst Störmer said that the nanoscale is more interesting than the atomic scale because the nanoscale is the first point where we can assemble something -- it's not until we start putting atoms together that we can make anything useful. In this article, we'll learn about what nanotechnology means today and what the future of nanotechnology may hold. We'll also look at the potential risks that come with working at the nanoscale. In the next section, we'll learn more about our world on the nanoscale. Launch Video Print Cite This!

There are numerous introductions to nanotechnology available on the internet but it is still difficult to understand exactly what it is. By definition, nanotechnology is the science of microengineering. Microengineering is the science of engineering that deals with particle manipulation if those particles are smaller than 100 nanometers. Atomic and molecular manipulation is the essential core of nanotechnology. This science is used to create applicable particles. Any introduction to nanotechnology is likely to be a bit hard to grasp on a rational level for those who like to deal in the concrete. However, it should be stated that one can visualize the concrete from the results of the particle manipulation. It is often the basics of our everyday materials. Some of the earliest instances of nanotechnology include the manipulation of materials to make new materials. Rubber, static electricity, and the atomic bomb are considered by many to be the early rudimentary stages of nanotechnology. From those early grass roots, nanotechnology has grown into a realm of science all its own. Now, the smallest particles are manipulated into products that many of us rely on without knowing that nanotechnology had anything to do with its production. Sunscreen is a product of nanotechnology. The zinc or titanium oxide found has been recently created by nanotechnology. While zinc oxide, as well as titanium oxide, has been around without the help of nano. A sunscreen or sun block that was created without the help of nanotechnology will stay white on the skin for a long period of time. Nanotechnology not only helps make the application process faster and cleaner, but it also provides for smaller particles that coat the skin better which provides much better sunscreen protection. Rash guards with UV protection are also the result of nanotechnology. Similar particles that protect the skin from sunburn on the beach are now coating articles of clothing to make the clothing stylish and sun resistant. For surfers, wake boarders, windsurfers, and other water athletes are saving themselves from the potential of skin cancer. Hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts are finding clothing that is protecting them as well. Your car will keep your finish longer and your eyeglasses are now less prone to scratches and gouges thank to nanotechnology. For a very simple introduction to nanotechnology all you have to do is look at the historical evolution of car finishes. Anti—scratch technology comes from the tiny particles that are now involved in the creation of coatings that make things like car finishes and eyeglass lenses last much longer. Part of an introduction to nanotechnology includes understanding the size of the particles that the scientists of the smallest bits deal with. One millimeter is about the size of a pin head. This pin head is equal to 1 million nanometers. This does not mean that all particles that are generally too small to be seen are included in the nanotechnology field. For most of us, picking out one single red blood cell is a significant challenge. However, for the nanotechnologists, this is a rather large particle since it measures 2,500 nanometers. Nanotechnology is now spreading across the many scientific fields, mostly out of necessity. Scientists of yesterday are finding a need to understand nano in order to perform their own research better. For instance, biologists need to take several comprehensive courses in nanotechnology in order to understand some of the smallest particles that keep life going. Engineers need to have a firm grasp of this very tiny scientific scale in order to build materials that will stand up to natural disasters and the force of time. The stronger we can build materials the less likely natural disasters will be to include loss of life. The tiniest of computers need to have the smallest of processors in order to make light and small computers more accessible. This will require smaller and smaller wiring capabilities. The smallest of wiring materials is engineered by the nanotechnology. The continuous experimentation with molecules and atoms will hopefully one day bring the technology to materialize objects at the push of a button. Replicators are already being tested and retested, which would give us the power to purchase dinner from our favorite restaurant and instead of waiting for delivery the replicator will make our meal materialize right in front of us. Imagine the limitless future that nanotechnology will bring citizens of the world.
