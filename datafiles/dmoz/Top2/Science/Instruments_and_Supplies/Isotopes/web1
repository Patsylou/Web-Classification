Its major areas of interest are the synthesis and applications of isotopicaly labeled compounds; the analysis and purification of isotopicaly labeled compounds; the applications of isotopes in various fields of science, industry as well as medicine; and uses in the discovery of new drugs. Â  The makers and users of isotopes have developed the Society as an international forum representing their specific needs to present their achievements and consult directly on their common denominator â the preparation and applications of isotopes. The Journal of Labeled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals is the official journal of the Society .

About Products Support Contact Gallery PicoTrace is a spin-off company, founded by members of the Faculty of Geosciences of the University of GĂśttingen, Germany. Our University has a well known tradition in geochemistry, established by Viktor Moritz Goldschmidt. C.W. Correns caused the University to found the first Institute of Geochemistry in Germany in 1962. K.H. Wedepohl was the first director of this institute. Nowadays at our Faculty of Geosciences a wide spectrum of geochemical methods is used in basic and applied geosciences, with special attempt on ICP mass spectrometry and isotope geochemistry. Since V. M. Goldschmidt, it is also traditional to enhance the limits of geochemical analysis by the development of special methods and equipment. The promoters of PicoTrace behold themselves in this tradition. The violent evolution in mass spectrometry exposed the problems of sample preparation. In this field, PicoTrace tries to close the gap. We know that the best systems of today are only average tomorrow. So it is our ambition, not only to facilitate our own experiences, but also to learn from our colleagues and walk on the same road with them. The systems, produced by PicoTrace have been developed for our own scientific work. They have been improved over a couple of years. In 1994 we decided to put them on the market. In our labs they are used continuously by students and experts. Limits and weakness, but also the quality of the systems is proofed every day. Therefore we are always close to your problems and ready for serious discussions.
