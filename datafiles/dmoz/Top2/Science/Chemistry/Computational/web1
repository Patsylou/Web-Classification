Many of these properties mirror those that can be measured experimentally. Through careful selection of methodology, the results of calculations can be used to predict molecular features, interpret experimental data, and understand molecular effects and behaviour. Intertek provides commercial computational chemistry services to customers on a contract basis. We possess the hardware and software platforms, and the expertise in selecting the best methodology, setting up and running calculations. We interpret the results, leaving you free to think about how the results fit into the bigger scientific picture. Molecular Structure and Interactions: Molecular geometry optimisation - determine the form of the structure that is most energetically favourable Conformational energetics - based on relative energies, determining how likely it is other forms will exist Effect of state on geometries and energetics - gas phase vs. solution vs. solid state The results of these calculations provide insight into structural properties, including molecular flexibility, isomerisation, tautomerism, solvation, aggregation and complexation. Molecular Property Calculations: Physical Property Prediction   - including pK a (dissociation constant), logP (partition coefficient, K ow ), logD and aqueous solubility Molecular stability / molecular reactivity - susceptibility to attack by nucleophiles, electrophiles and radicals Excited State Property Prediction  - including electronic transition energies and probabilities Excited state reactivity Magnetic property prediction - dipoles, multipoles and NMR shielding Vibrational property prediction - normal mode frequencies and activities The results of these calculations can be used to help understand properties, including ionisation, solubility, chromatographic separation, reactivity, degradation mechanisms, colour, UV/vis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) , infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies, and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD).

A: Gynecomastia is the overdevelopment of male breasts. The glandular tissue of the breast swells, usually in response to an excess of estrogen or a lack of testosterone. In addition to having enlarged breasts, men or boys with gynecomastia may notice their breasts feel rubbery or firm. Gynecomastia can usually be diagnosed from a physical examination and medical history. In most cases, tests are not necessary. However, if the breast lump is unusually large, one-sided, tender, or hard and fixed, a biopsy may be done to rule out other problem. Q: In what ways can one get rid of gynecomastia? A: Gynecomastia can disappear on its own in a year or more, as hormone levels correct themselves. However, be wary of pills and creams that claim to treat the condition. These are often expensive and do not deliver real results. Plastic Surgery is the only effective treatment for gynecomastia that will not go away. Q: How do I know if I am a candidate for male breast reduction? A: Treating the underlying cause of the gynecomastia may lead to improvement in the condition. Patients should talk with their doctor about revising any medications that are found to be causing gynecomastia. Following this, if the gynecosmastia continues to be a prominent problem, the only effective treatment option is surgery. This procedure, in which the excess breast tissue is removed, is safe for most patients who have struggled with gynecomastia and wish to correct it.

Dr. Anna Wooten, MD, FACS Shared publicly 2014-02-19 #CosmeticSurgeryPittsburgh #CosmeticProcedures #PlasticSurgery Several Ways to Make Your Hands Youthful: There are various signs of aging that everyone may experience. Some of these visible signs are sun spots on your body, wrinkles and lines on your face, and even wrinkles on your hands. Some people are sensitive enough with their face and hands since these are the parts which will be noticed by everyone. Fortunately, there are some steps they can take so as to ensure that their hands stay young and good-looking. You may consider the following techniques and ways on how to keep your hands youthful and good-looking: • Use the best products on the market. There are lots of products you can apply to your hands. These may include lotions, creams, moisturizers and others. Make sure that these products are recommended by your physician to not face any risks or complications. At some point, these products can help you to make your hands youthful. Furthermore, according to dermatologists, most people won’t see any signs of aging on their hands if they are not yet in their 30’s or 40’s. However, it is still advisable to use and apply products like lotions and creams while you are in your 20’s in order to prevent wrinkles and lines on your hands later on. Always remember that it is better to protect your hands at a younger age than to search for solutions to wrinkles when you get older. • Undergo cosmetic procedures. If you are not satisfied with the products on the market, you may start looking for some cosmetic treatments. There are many surgeons who can help you with your concerns. So, you may consult them for the maintenance of your youthful hands. One of the treatments that you may undergo is hand rejuvenation. This procedure can remove sunspots and other blemishes on your skin. Also, it can maintain the good-looking surface of your hands. If you take any cosmetic surgeries like hand rejuvenation, it is very important to look for a certified board cosmetic surgery. Of course, the best surgeon will give you an assurance that you will have a successful treatment. http://la-beleza.com/cosmetic-surgery-pittsburgh/several-ways-to-make-your-hands-youthful/ #CosmeticSurgeryPittsburgh #CosmeticProcedures ﻿ Read more Show less Several Ways to Make Your Hands Youthful | Plastic Surgeons Pittsburgh PA la-beleza.com 1 Add a comment... Dr. Anna Wooten, MD, FACS Shared publicly 2014-02-14 #Wrinkles #AntiAging #Skincare Wrinkles and facial lines will inevitably occur, especially in old age. But why is it that some people have some facial lines and wrinkles at a young age and others do not? What do you think are the primary reasons? First, the appearance of wrinkles and some facial lines at a young age is primarily because of some vices like smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages and not using sunscreen. Of course, if you don’t use sunscreen while you are working under the heat of the sun, it may also cause skin damage and eventually give you some lines and wrinkles on your face. These primary factors are true and apply to all. However, there is a new study that claims that the potential cause of early wrinkles and facial lines is down to the genes you receive from your mother. The new study reveals that the mitochondria or the power houses of cells can do something in terms of aging. If the mitochondria sustain further damage, they transform and may lose their ability to reproduce energy. This may result in cell breakdown and eventually lead to the signs of aging. The DNA of mitochondria can possibly be passed down to you by your mother which also influences your aging process. So, if your mother had facial wrinkles and lines at a young age, then you might also have these wrinkles at a young age as well. How to Get Rid of Your Facial Lines and Wrinkles: To remove your facial lines and wrinkles, there are numerous treatments that are available. Some of these treatments are less invasive and some treatments cost a high amount of money. Here are some of the best treatments you may utilize to get rid of your wrinkles and facial lines: • Collagen injection – This is one of the most common treatments used in order to fill some facial lines and flatten the skin’s surface. In this procedure, your skin’s surface will look softer and smoother. • Laser resurfacing – This is a popular treatment that removes the skin’s top layer. It promotes new healthy skin for beauty enhancement. • Botox injections – This is a type of treatment that can remove wrinkles and prevent the skin muscles from contracting. These treatments are essential in reducing deep wrinkles and facial lines. However, if you want to undergo any of these procedures, it is advisable to consult your doctor first, as they will examine you to see if you are a good candidate for the procedure.﻿ Read more Show less Plastic Surgery Pittsburgh - Plastic Surgeon Dr. Anna Wooten, MD, FACS la-beleza.com 1 Add a comment...

The treatment, however, uses sound that occurs at frequencies only dolphins and bats can detect...ultrasound. This ultrasound is not only used to image the skin (like in a sonogram); the sound wave juice gets bumped up and the pulses are prolonged to also treat the skins tissue. As a result of the treatment, the bodys own healing process kicks in to stimulate collagen production and gradually lift the skin over the course of three to six months. http://www1.plasticsurgery.org/find_a_surgeon/default.aspx?zip=15219member=wooten #pittsburgh #boardcertifiedplasticsurgeonspittsburgh #boardcertifiedplasticsurgeon #plasticsurgery #plasticsurgeon #ultherapy  ﻿ Read more Show less Find a Plastic Surgeon: Board-Certified, ASPS | The American Society of Plastic Surgeons www1.plasticsurgery.org 1 Add a comment...

A: Gynecomastia is the overdevelopment of male breasts. The glandular tissue of the breast swells, usually in response to an excess of estrogen or a lack of testosterone. In addition to having enlarged breasts, men or boys with gynecomastia may notice their breasts feel rubbery or firm. Gynecomastia can usually be diagnosed from a physical examination and medical history. In most cases, tests are not necessary. However, if the breast lump is unusually large, one-sided, tender, or hard and fixed, a biopsy may be done to rule out other problem. Q: In what ways can one get rid of gynecomastia? A: Gynecomastia can disappear on its own in a year or more, as hormone levels correct themselves. However, be wary of pills and creams that claim to treat the condition. These are often expensive and do not deliver real results. Plastic Surgery is the only effective treatment for gynecomastia that will not go away. Q: How do I know if I am a candidate for male breast reduction? A: Treating the underlying cause of the gynecomastia may lead to improvement in the condition. Patients should talk with their doctor about revising any medications that are found to be causing gynecomastia. Following this, if the gynecosmastia continues to be a prominent problem, the only effective treatment option is surgery. This procedure, in which the excess breast tissue is removed, is safe for most patients who have struggled with gynecomastia and wish to correct it. Q: Is male breast reduction to address gynecomastia covered by insurance? A: For cases of gynecomastia, surgery is the only known physical remedy. In some cases the surgery can be covered by insurance. This is not standard, and varies according to each individual patient’s insurance provider and their specific condition. http://la-beleza.com/gynecomastia-surgery-pittsburgh/faq-about-gynecomastia-and-male-breast-reduction/ #GynecomastiaSurgeryPittsburgh #GynecomastiaPittsburgh ﻿ Read more Show less FAQ about Gynecomastia and Male Breast Reduction | Plastic Surgeons Pittsburgh PA la-beleza.com 1 Add a comment...

Surgical operations can probably help you in some significant ways. However, there are some instances in which risks and complications may occur due to plastic surgeons that are unprofessional and do not have enough knowledge or skills. For you to avoid any possible risks or complications during and after the surgical operations, it is advisable to choose the best surgeon for your treatment. As your guide, you may consider the following tips and reminders on how you can find the best and most professional plastic surgeon: • You may start researching your surgeon online using doctor-rating sites. You can check if a surgeon is on the lists of the Certified Board of Medicine and be able to know if the doctor had a suspension or a revoke of his or her service. In this way, you may know if the surgeon suits your standards and qualifications. • Make sure that your surgeon is not practicing in any field which is not in line with his or her expertise. There are some surgeons that offer their services though they are not qualified. So, you must do extensive research and investigate if they are capable of rendering the service for you. • If you want to undergo any kind of plastic surgery, you have to consider a certified surgeon by the ABPS or the American Board of Plastic Surgery. You may also consider a surgeon that is certified by ASAPS or the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. In other words, there must be a surgeons’ certification before they perform such surgical operations. • You may also ask some of the doctors and nurses in your town about plastic surgery providers. Of course, they will know the doctors who have a good reputation in your locality. • It is advisable to get an opinion from other people. Some people will know the best service providers for the plastic surgery, so they may be able to help you in choosing the right one. These tips can greatly help you when looking for a professional plastic surgeon. However, always bear in mind that most doctors are ethical people, honest and patient-oriented since they always put the interest of the patients first.

Facial facelift – Its Benefits and Advantages Both men and women may undergo a facial facelift or Rhytidectomy. With this type of procedure, they can rejuvenate their physical appearance and they can even minimize the lines and wrinkles on their face. Also, Rhytidectomy helps to enhance some visible signs of aging in certain parts of the body, such as: • Double chin • Displaced fat • Drooping in the middle part of the face • Deep creases on the nose • Deep creases underneath your lower eyelids • Loss of muscle tone on some parts of your face Actually, there are 3 main types of facial facelift surgery and these are the traditional, keyhole surgery and MACS, which is also known as the minimal access cranial suspension. In a traditional facelift, the incision begins on the hairlines, goes on the ears and ends in the lower part of scalp. Sometimes, the deeper layer of the muscles and face are lifted in this procedure. In keyhole surgery, the surgeon creates small incisions on the skin surface of the patient’s face. In most cases, this procedure is typically used for upper facelifts and brow lifts. It also provides minimal scarring and short downtime. In the MACS surgery, there is only a smaller incision on the face. Removal of excess fat and tightening of the facial muscles are done through this small surgical incision.

Women tend to undergo some kind of plastic surgery because they know it can help them enhance their appearance. So, with the help of the plastic surgeons, they can possibly achieve the physical look that they are aiming for. Some of them undergo breast augmentation because they want to have a bigger size and they also want to reshape their breasts.

Some patients have also testified that this treatment provides great results and is safe. So, you don’t need to fret about the procedure. Here are some essential tips on how to make your breasts look more natural through plastic surgery: • If you consider an implant procedure, you should talk to your surgeon first about the treatment. You cannot instantly choose a specific size for your implant since there are several factors that should be considered. Some of these factors are the breast width, rib cage size and your overall health condition. • Stay away from breasts which are 360 degrees in border. You should also avoid over sized implants which can create a bony and wide gap between your breasts. You may talk to your doctor about a specific size that is suitable for you. • You may add extra style to your breasts. Some surgeons use silicone cutlet inserts in order to fully enhance the size of your breasts. • Maintain the appearance of your breasts by avoiding too much exposure to the heat of the sun. This is because your breasts may droop due to the breakage of the collagen. Whatever the size and shape of your breasts will be, you have to be confident enough in facing the world. For professional assistance on plastic surgery, you may contact a certified board plastic surgeon in your locality and find out several ways on how you can achieve breasts that are more natural.
