 atomicalex.com Katherine, in real life About me Cars Motorbikes Ride Reports Things I will miss about Germany Rhenish Bauernsalat Posted by atomicalex on 26 January , 2014 Style Leave a Comment It doesnt sound like a at all. Greens, fried potatoes, and fried eggs. Most people I talk to tell me that it completely defeats the purpose of eating a salad. No, not at all. A deftige Bauernsalat farmer salad is one of the Rhein regions true culinary delights. It starts with some field greens, placed on one half of a plate. Dress them, then add vegetables of your choosing. Top with cubes of fresh cheese, a wonderful feta-like preparation. On the other side, bring on the Bratkartoffeln, those strange yellow potatoes that have been boiled and fried with plenty of salt and spices. Top those off with two Spiegeleier sunny-side up eggs. It goes from just salad to meal in no time at all. And its yummy. It does not defeat the purpose of salad at all. It makes just a salad into a real dinner.

We were in our temporary apartment in Germany, I was in the shower, and someone had decided to wash dishes. Oh. My. God. My skin was suddenly peeling off thanks to alternate bursts of freezing cold and boiling hot water. The German conciousness includes the perjorative term literally a person who likes hot showers, or moreso, a person who eschews cold ones. Basically, a person who likes comfort. After all, who could possibly want to be comfortable? That would be inefficient and self-centered, right? I dont mind being uncomfortable, sleeping outdoors is fun, and come on, I ride motorcycles until the roads ice up. The elements are not foreign to me. But that abrupt switch from nicely hot water to cold (or worse, even hotter) in the shower? How about NO. The demand for energy efficiency, combined with a lack of caring about whether a shower is a nice place to be or not led to the demise of the (apparently) horribly inefficient hot water tank in Germany. Enter the Durchlauferhitzer an extremely efficient version  of the basic in-line on-demand water heater. It is a horrible little 5 to 20l electronic confection that claims to deliver hot water exactly where and when you need it. It does, with one caveat its pressure drop actuated so FSM help you if there is more than one fixture connected to it. Unlike on-demand units in the US that regulate the outlet water temperature and pressure to maintain some semblance of control at the faucet, the German variety of the unit is either on, or, off. And because its pressure drop actuated, getting any control at the mixing valve is a delicate ballet of pressure balancing. Wait. They dont have pressure balancing mixer valves over here, either. We moved into the house eventually, and my hopes for Fernwärme (city steam) were dashed. Three of the miserable little devices were installed instead of a single hot water tank or simple valve in the basement. The device in the kitchen was the most damned of all of them a 5l unit that delivered what amounted to either cold water or steam. In steam mode, one had about five minutes of dish washing and rinsing time before the it was back to cold water. Fifteen minutes later, the steam was back on. No amount of twiddling with the dial produced any temperature other than scalding or cold. So much for adjustability. It looked adjustable. I guess that was good enough. The unit on the upper floor was equally useless. It had two settings, both of which were at the mercy of the incoming water temperature. Eventually, we gave up on it and allowed the boys to shower on the first floor, where the installed 20l unit had not only a temperature dial to set, but a selector to choose how many of the three heating elements one wished to use! We monitored the seasons and the weather in the nearby mountains in an attempt to predict how to adjust the dials to achieve that elusive hot-but-not-scalding water. This unit was so sensitive to pressure drop changes that we did not do anything with household water when a shower was underway. Eventually, we found it best to use it as the thermal control for the shower and just run the shower valve straight hot, avoiding most pressure drop issues. One thing we found with each of the horrible little misery machines was that they leak water out of the outlet side when heating. Not a problem when you are running water, but when not, there is a constant drip. Because the water is hard as a rock, you get constant calcium buildup. Id post a picture, but honestly, who wants to see that? The time spent soaking various parts of faucets and other water-use devices in vinegar and other forms of chemistry became measurable as time in the house dragged on. The chiseling of hard water deposits out of the toilets was a special task reserved for the boys. The one place that we did not have to worry about calcium buildup was the dishwasher. German dishwashers include a built-in water softener. You pull out the racks and add salt to a container in the base of the tub. I was shocked by this. I refused to believe it was required. Then, I had to clean the filters. OK, wheres that salt? Of course, the lack of a soft food disposer didnt make that job any easier. Over here, you do have to wash the stupid dishes before you put them in. Mind-boggling. I did not expect the stupid dishwasher to be a Warmduscher. I expected it to wash my dishes without needing help. Ironically, one cannot turn off the heated dry cycle on most German dishwashers. Who was that carrying on about energy savings? I wont miss the water in Germany with all of its issues at all. I will go home to my 50 gallon gas-fired hot water tank full of nice, naturally soft Great Lakes water. I will stuff my dishwasher with dirty plates, turn it on, and use the time Ive saved by not washing them first to take a long and just-perfectly-hot shower without worrying about temperature fluctuations. I will be a Warmduscher in the literal sense. And it will be glorious.

A blue Golf. He was thinking about getting an A1, but didnt like the loud colors. This from a guy who wears purple plaid shirts to work. Southern Germans, specifically Audi , basically invented the boring silver car that seems to drive the perception of and image of German people in the US. The real reason for the silver cars is that most German execs dont want to be seen driving flashy cars, to the point that they will order the boring silver car with the badges removed. No chance at identifying it as better than anyone elses, that might attract envy. Whatever. The only other color Audis seem to be available in over here is trash-truck orange. I dont get the dichotomy, but I do love it. image credit autoblog.com German people are a colorful dichotomy in every part of their lives. They decry the possibility of sharing personal data, but give out their bank account information like candy on St Martins Day. They dont want to be seen, but dress in beautifully colorful and creatively designed, extremely close-fitting clothes. Which they happily remove completely at sauna. They are the first to blur their license plates and house numbers on Google Maps, but they drive bright green cars which they park directly out front. Have I mentioned the number of personalized license plates? They are everywhere! I love the color. I love the patterns. I love the lack of grey in daily life in Germany. I love the close-fitting tailored clothes. I love the fact that the typical German person takes the time to carefully choose what to show and what to hide, rather simply hiding everything or showing everything, like we do in American culture. Lets face it if you are worried about your thighs in the US, you wear a grey suit cut like a flour sack to work, regardless of the fact that your upper half would make the cover of Vogue. Here in Germany, ladies pay little or no attention to their less-stellar-looking parts and focus on drawing attention to what looks good or even great.  Guys are the same way dressing for what works, rather than for what doesnt. And the color! Did I mention the color? Or the prints? Or the plaids? Oh, fabulous!! There is a reason Desigual is beloved here. Before I left, quite a few colleagues mentioned that I would likely fit in much better in Germany due to my clothing habits. And I did. Then I went even further. I put aside all of my grey sack suits and I bought a hot pink suit that is cut just so. I customer ordered pink and white motorcycle leathers. I dropped a small fortune at Desigual, and I have a few more items in mind to grab before I leave. Oh, wait, Ill be back, so there will be no end to my Desigual habit, I think! It drives my American colleagues nuts when I and my attire walk into a room. I no longer care I am sorry that they are afraid to look awesome. I am not any more.  I am no longer ashamed of my body or of my colorful sense of self. I will continue to use color for purpose. I am contemplating replacing my old blue Passat with a froggy green Golf one day. Or a yellow Elise. Yes. A yellow Elise sounds just about perfect. Bookmark on Delicious Digg this post Recommend on Facebook share via Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet about it Subscribe to the comments on this post Things I will miss about Germany the TÜV Posted by atomicalex on 19 January , 2014 Motorbikes , Style Leave a Comment I will miss Germany, for sure. Germany is cool. A different cool than Detroit, which I have missed for the past 3.5+ years. I will also miss the TÜV. Germanys much maligned inspection authority is not really the end of the world. Sometimes, its the only way to get things done. Last month, I was back home in Detroit and needed to visit the tyre shop. Two of my snow tyres were leaking air, and I wanted to get them checked out and probably remounted. Ive been using this shop for more than ten years, and sent countless friends there. I dont know how many tyres Ive bought from them, its a large number. The techs remember me, even though I havent been around (or buying lots of tyres) for the past three years. However, they refused to work on the car at all. They added air and sent me packing with no technical assistance whatsoever. Why? Because I run spacers up front to correct the offset on the wheels I use for winter driving. The VW OEM Classix wheels I use require 10mm of additional offset to clear the suspension on my B5 Passat and keep the steering geometry properly arranged. I use a nice set of HR hub-centric spacers and proper-length bolts. The rear wheels, which do not require this modification, do not run spacers, and they were the ones leaking. I fully understood that the shop would not touch the fronts, but for sure the rears. Nope. No way. The car has spacers, no touchy. Now I have to find a new tyre shop. One that is not averse to properly setup cars. One that can get beyond panic attacks when  customer shows up with something out of the ordinary. One that can measure bolts and add. In Germany, this would not have been an issue. I would have showed up, handed over my paperwork, and gotten the repairs done. My paperwork would (and does) consist of a stack of ABEs allgemeine Betriebserlaubnisscheine the documents that say, yes, this is approved for general use on one or another cars. A matching set of papers for my wheels, spacers, and bolts, and no problem, because the tyre shop would have written proof that everything was in order and therefore safe to work on. For as much moaning and groaning as the Germans do, there are far far far more officially modified cars as a percentage of the general population in Germany than in the US. Nearly every car owner has a set of extra wheels or tyres or so on that requires papers. And once you have papers, you have papers. End of discussion. Just keep track of them. Youre going to need them at the tyre shop, but so will everyone else. My German colleagues, right down to the least-car-aware of them, were shocked that I would run into such an issue in the US, because who needs papers over there, right? The truth is that the TÜV serves as a backstop for just about everything. Not sure where to place blame? Ask the TÜV. Better yet, ask for TÜV papers. Have them, and you are golden. Nope? Maybe sweat a bit, and go get them in a hurry. Its really far less of an issue than anyone makes it out to be. Of course, I always have papers. Maybe Ill get lucky and find a new shop that does motorcycles tyres, too. I am going to need some of them. And maybe they will even accept my ABEs.

So, as I found myself awake at my normal time (that being 0500 in England), I decided to hop the ferry and spend the rest of the day poking around France, Belgium, and then getting home before dark. I hit the internet to book a PO ticket. The Peninsular and Oriental Line is the largest ferry operator in the world, and runs ferries between Dover and Calais and Dover and Dunkirk. The Calais route was a bit cheaper and 30 minutes shorter, so I selected that one. I chose an 8.25 departure Id surely make that, and perhaps they have the same deal as le Shuttle arrive early and leave early when possible. The Port of Dover is nothing to mess with. Its huge, with four ferry operators moving mostly freight across the English Channel at all hours of the day and night. POis the largest with the most ships and two berths. The arrival process is virtually identical to that of the train first clear your ticket/reservation, then immigration and customs. I was not checked out of England, only checked in to France, and customs was again a wa(i)ve through. After finding the right lane as you leave customs, you must find the lane for the ferry you have chosen and the type of vehicle you are driving you receive a hangtag with a time on it, and a slip with a lane number. You then are signed through the port along a snakey route to your departure lane. From the departure lane, you enter the ferry. Freight boards on the lower deck, cars, caravans, and bikes on the upper deck. I was on deck seven. Riding up the ramp made me quite happy to have my little billy goat of a bike its a bit steep and steel. Bikes are strapped down over the seat at the rear of the ferry there is room for up to 24 bikes on the Spirit of Britain and its sister ship, the Spirit of France. Both are among the newest and most up-to-date ships plying the Channel waterway. It is the riders responsibility to insure that the crew have secured the bike. Within minutes, the crew was uncoupling the ferry from the dock and we were off, but not before the crew had shooed me upstairs unlike le Shuttle, the rider does not remain with her vehicle. Once again, the last to load, this time by mere minutes. Upstairs, the boat is quite well-fitted out. Several cafes, a room full of video games, another room full of slot machines, a food court, a Club Lounge, a family area, and a reserved area for freight drivers all compete with the ubiquitous duty-free shop. I was disappointed again to find no stickers for sale. I spent most of the time out on the rear observation deck, watching the cliffs fade into the distance. The 90 minute trip is just right time enough to explore without getting bored. The ship is well-maintained, and like all good ships, contantly being cleaned and observed by the staff. I was not prepared for the drinking Englishmen its 9AM, people even the Germans are not in the beer that early. Disembarkment was the reverse of loading, with the exception that riders can scoot off behind the first lane of exiting cars. Like in Dover, the Port of Calais is simple to navigate on the exit. I stopped in Dunkirk to see the belfry and St Eloi church, and on the way into town could not resist snapping a pic of a very silly restaurant. It was market day, and the entire downtown was crowded with shoppers. The next stop was an architecturally interesting rest stop, which like so many other things in France, was not functional. Pretty to look at in a weird 80s way. I headed over to Brugge to grab a Belgie sticker. My trusty Garmin navi then took me on a bunch of backroads, where I found that whereever Donk is, it wasnt there. I had to ignore it for a while on the next leg, as it was trying to route me around a  traffic jam. I wanted to stay on teh highway, as the lanes are wider and easier to split. The 32 minute posted delay was more like a five minute delay for me. My last stop was the Circuit Zolder in Belgium, where a testing day was taking place. Then it was into the ridiculous rain and wind and on to home, with a few more countries on the bike, and the Channel crossing complete. Bookmark on Delicious Digg this post Recommend on Facebook share via Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet about it Subscribe to the comments on this post Channel Crossings 1: le Shuttle Posted by atomicalex on 3 November , 2013 Motorbikes , Style Leave a Comment I decided to take a ride to Kent, UK. No real plans, but did want to try out the Channel Tunnel train and the ferry. Here is a brief bit about how to cross the English Channel relatively stress-free. The first step is committing to go. All ferries and the train are cheaper if you book at least a week ahead. But even as a last minute rider, you can still take advantage of one loophole in booking book early for the latest passage you think youll make, and you can take whatever is open up until then. I booked le Shuttle, the French name for the train that goes under the big gash, for a 13.50 departure. The Euro Tunnel trains are priced in two-hour intervals, so I booked the latest train in the interval in which I planned to arrive. I arranged my riding to bring me to Calais a full two hours earlier to allow for some stops if I found them necessary. The Port of Calais has a rather nice shopping area, but do not count on buying postcards or stickers, there are none available. The shopping is focused on the old-school duty-free mindset of buy as much alcohol and perfume as you can. When you arrive, you come first to a booth which asks you to either buy a ticket or check-in. I punched in my reservation number and was advised that I was early and could choose any one of the three remaining shuttles in my booking window. I picked the next one and received a hangtag for my mirror printed with the shuttle code and a receipt. The next step was customs and border control. The UK is not Shengen, so one must get ones passport stamped after answering the usual questions. As an American living in Germany, I had a few more to answer, but nothing profound. I passed first through the French border station, then through the UK station, then through Customs. Motorcycles are typically waved through Customs, how much could we be carrying anyway? Once through the paperwork (about 15-20 minutes), you are directed to a parking area near the shopping/food court.  A large LED board shows the calls for trains, and you wait or shop until you are called. Then it is off along a winding path to the boarding area. One goes up the ramp over the train tracks, then down to board. Bikes are pooled up to board last. All bikes board on the lower level the cars are sent up and down. Unlike the AutoZug, there is plenty of clearance to ride in comfortably and walk around inside of the cars. Apparently the last two cars are reserved for bikes. I was the only rider on my train, so had an entire compartment to myself. You enter the train over a steel and then ride in. I was wisely advised to avoid the metal strip in the center its not the stiffest piece of metal and stay to one side. Bikes are best ridden in on the right side, then turned across the way at an angle and parked with the front tyre up against the left edge. Out comes the sidestand, and thats it. Youre loaded on. A few safety checks, intercomparment doors are closed, and youre off! Each car is equipped with a bathroom, but that is it. No amenities for the 35 minute trip that is 35 minutes. No longer. Its barely enough time to snap some photos and notice that the train is moving. I was able to scarf down the sandwich Id brought with and chat with the steward for a few moments, but it seemed like no time at all and we were back in the light. le Shuttle, as its called in French, is clearly designed to remain in motion. We arrived at Folkstone and began the disembarkment process. About halfway out of the train, I looked back and discovered that they were already loading the next cars. Leaving the train, one can see the forward section that is full-height and used to move freight trucks. As immigration and customs were completed in Calais, one simply rides out of the terminal, up a ramp (the inductive sensor did not pick up my bike and I had to cross against the light), and into a right turn. Into the left lane. Then, a traffic circle. Ok, may as well get of that out of the way quickly. There are seemingly hundreds of signs scattered at the road side up to 50kms from Folkstone reminding people in four languages to drive on the left. Id purchased a smallish windscreen cling that showed the driver on the left of the road and how to navigate a traffic circle. I kept it in my map pocket stuck to its white background paper it was a good reminder. Conveniently, it can be reversed for use on the continent. I visited the White Cliffs Nature Park and Canterbury Cathedral. Then off to Margate, which I was completely shocked by. Having spent some time at the Jersey shore, I was floored to discover that its twin exists in England. In fact, throughout my short tour of Kent, I was continually amazed to discover that there is nothing particularly special or unique about the Jersey shore, or larger parts of New Jersey and Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are little carbon copies of Kent, without the cool stuff like Canterbury and Sandwich. Unfortunately, it was a holiday weekend in the UK, so I have no cool BnB story to tell just a PremierInn that wasnt afraid of a chick on a bike, and had a clean and comfy (if noisy due to floor squeaks) room for 65quid.

This craft is a custom tool roll. Tool rolls are used by mechanics to store tools that are all used in one job for example, two wrenches, a pair of pliers, an extension, and four screwdrivers. Sometimes, a full set of wrenches might be stored. However they are stuffed, they make life easy by not only providing a place to keep the tools safe and sound, but also to protect them and provide a soft work surface to lay them out on. Your tool-using buddies will love this, and probably ask for more of them. I use them for my motorcycles first to replace the crappy plastic ones that come with the bikes, and second to make customized ones for trips where I want to take only a certain set of tools in the least amount of space possible. Im thinking of making one for a GF to hold her knitting needles! You need fabric, thread, and twill tape to make this craft. Use a heavy cotton twill or denim fabric. Cotton is great because it will hold some oil and this will keep the tools from rusting. Do not use bias or other types of tape, these will stretch or wear out much more quickly than twill. Start with a rectangle of fabric. For a large tool roll, 24 is a good size. A smaller tool roll might start with 18 or even smaller. All sorts of sizes are possible and useful. A special tool roll with an angled bound edge or bottom edge is also used for certain wrench sets. Fold a length of twill tape once and bind one of the short edges with it. Fold up the bound edge about 1/3 of the way if you have 24 of fabrid, fold up a bit more than 8. Mark off every 2 and sew channels into the folded fabric from the bottom edge up to the bound edge. Place a bar tack at the bound edge end of each channel to support it. For smaller tool rolls, 1 channels will work, too. Smaller than 1 and nothing really fits. Baste the outside edges of the two end channels. Next, fold and iron enough twill tape to stitch around the outside edge. Zigzag this on, paying attention to going around the corners. Fancier tool rolls will have rounded edges at the top. Cut a length of twill tape about 1.5x longer than the tool roll is wide, and bar tack this to the back side just below the bound edge. Flip the tool roll over and fold down the top flap over the bound edge, then roll it up and tie it with the twill tape youve tacked to the back side. This is a completed tool roll. If you have an embroidery machine, it would be very cool to enbroider their names on the outside of the flap.

 Percy Lavon Julian From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Percy Julian ) navigation ,       search Percy Lavon Julian Julian circa 1940–1950 Born ( 1899-04-11 ) April 11, 1899 Montgomery, Alabama Died April 19, 1975 ( 1975-04-19 ) (aged76) Waukegan, Illinois Occupation Chemist Spouse(s) Anna Roselle Johnson Children Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. Parents Elizabeth Lena Adams Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899, Montgomery, Al. – April 19, 1975, Waukegan, Illinois) was a U.S. research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. [ 1 ] He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine , and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones, steroids , progesterone , and testosterone , from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work would lay the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone , other corticosteroids , and birth control pills . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] He later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the Mexican wild yam . His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] During his lifetime he received more than 130 chemical patents. Julian was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctorate in chemistry . He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences , and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field.

James, like his wife, a graduate of what was to be Alabama State University was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the United States Post Office , and his father was a slave . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Elizabeth worked as a school teacher. Percy Julian grew up in the time of the racist Jim Crow laws culture in the United States. Among his childhood memories was finding a lynched man hung from a tree while walking in the woods near his home. While it was generally unheard of for African-Americans at the time to pursue an education beyond the eighth grade, Julian's parents steered all of their children toward higher education. Julian attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana . The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated nature of the town forced social humiliations. Julian was not allowed to live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He worked firing the furnace, as a waiter, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house. In return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian . [ 11 ] By 1930 Julian's father had moved the entire family to Greencastle, Indiana so that all his children could attend college at DePauw. The father was still working as a railroad postal clerk. [ 8 ] Julian wanted to obtain his doctorate in chemistry, but learned it would be difficult for an African-American. After graduating from DePauw, Julian became a chemistry instructor at Fisk University . He then received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry and went to Harvard University in 1923 for his M.S. Worried that white students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship . He was unable to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard. In 1929, while an instructor at Howard University, Julian received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to continue his graduate work at the University of Vienna , where he earned his PhD in 1931. He studied under Ernst Späth and was considered an impressive student. In Europe, he found freedom from the racial prejudices that had nearly stifled him in the States. He freely participated in intellectual social gatherings, went to the opera and found greater acceptance among his peers. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Julian was one of the first African-Americans to receive a PhD in chemistry, after St. Elmo Brady and Edward M. A. Chandler. [ 6 ] [ 14 ] During Julian's lifetime he earned more than 138 chemical patents for his work. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences , and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field. After returning from Vienna , Julian taught at Howard University for one year, where he met his future wife, Anna Roselle Johnson (PhD in Sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They married on December 24, 1935 and had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 – February 24, 2008), who became a prestigious civil rights lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin ; [ 15 ] and Faith Roselle Julian (1944– ), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes moving speeches about her father and his contributions to science. [ 11 ] At Howard, Julian got involved in university politics and set off an embarrassing chain of events. After he goaded, at the University President's request, a white chemist named Jacob Shohan into resigning, Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local African-American newspaper the letters Julian had written to him from Vienna . The letters contained accounts of Julian's sex life, and criticism of individual Howard faculty members. Julian's laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson, also charged he had found his wife and Julian together in a sexual tryst. When Thompson was fired for filing a lawsuit against the University, he also gave the paper racy letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Through the summer of 1932, the Baltimore Afro-American published all of Julian's letters. Eventually, the scandal, and its accompanying pressure, forced Julian to resign. He lost his position, and everything he had worked for. [ 6 ] After the scandal, Julian's mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline at the lowest point in Julian's career. Blanchard offered Julian a position to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, to come to the United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine , and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. was the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not, in fact, created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean . [ 6 ] Julian also extracted stigmasterol , which took its name from Physostigma venenosum , the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time in 1934, Butenandt, and Fernholz, in Germany, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry. Private sector work: Glidden After being denied a professorship at DePauw in 1936 for racial reasons, Julian applied for a job at the Institute of Paper Chemistry (IPC) in Wisconsin. However, the Wisconsin city of Appleton where the institute was located, was a sundown town , forbidding African-Americans from staying overnight, stating directly "No Negro should be bed or boarded overnight in Appleton". DuPauw had offered a job to fellow chemist Josef Pikl, but declined to hire Julian, who had superlative qualifications as an organic chemist, apologizing that they were "unaware he was a Negro". [ 18 ] Julian wrote to the Glidden Company , a supplier of soybean oil products, in part because his wife was suffering infertility , to request a five gallon sample of the oil to use as his starting point for the synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones. [ 3 ] After receiving the request, W.J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses. [ 6 ] Julian supervised the assembly of the plant at Glidden when he arrived in 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints. At the start of World War II Glidden sent a sample of Julian's isolated soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of Kidde Fire Fighting ) of Philadelphia, PA which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam, [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the U.S. Navy's beloved fire-fighting "bean soup"; and while not exactly the Julian's brainchild, was given the meticulous care in the preparation of the soy protein that made the fire fighting foam possible. When a hydrolyzate of isolated soy protein was fed into a water stream, the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It saved the lives of thousands of sailors. [ 20 ] Citing this, in 1947 the NAACP awarded him the Spingarn Medal , its highest honor. Steroids Julian's research at Glidden changed direction in 1940 when he began work on synthesizing progesterone , estrogen and testosterone from the plant sterols , stigmasterol and sitosterol , isolated from soybean oil by a foam technique he invented and patented. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 21 ] At that time clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones. However, only minute quantities could be produced from the extraction of hundreds of pounds of spinal cords. In 1940 Julian was able to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000, in sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides . The result was the female hormone progesterone which was put on the U.S. market in bulk for the first time.The soy stigmasterol was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone, progesterone , and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 was shipped to the buyer in an armored car. [ 5 ] Production of other sex hormones soon followed. [ 22 ] His work made possible the production of these hormones on a larger (kilogram) industrial scale, with the potential of reducing the cost of treating hormonal deficiencies. Julian and his co-workers obtained patents for Glidden on key processes for the preparation of progesterone and testosterone from soybean plant sterols. Product patents held by a former cartel of European pharmaceutical companies prevented a significant reduction in wholesale and retail prices for clinical use of these hormones in the 1940s [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] On April 13, 1949, rheumatologist Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic announced the dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis . The cortisone was produced by Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett . It started with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids . On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide , which was a rare and expensive chemical. [ 26 ] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which may have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone synthesized from the soybean oil sterol, stigmasterol of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S ), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] but unfortunately they were not. [ 29 ] On April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn published the first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales ). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone ( cortisol ). [ 31 ] After two years, Glidden abandoned production of cortisone to concentrate on Substance S. Julian developed an excellent multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone , available in abundance from soybean oil sterols to cortexolone . In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex ). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydro cortisone. [ 29 ] In 1953, Glidden decided to leave the steroid business which had been relatively unprofitable over the years despite Julian's innovative work. [ 32 ] On December 1, 1953, Julian left Glidden after 18 years, giving up a salary of nearly $50,000 a year, to found his own company, Julian Laboratories, Inc., taking over the small, concrete-block building of Suburban Chemical Company in Franklin Park, Illinois . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] On December 2, 1953, Pfizer acquired exclusive licenses of Glidden patents for the synthesis of Substance S. Pfizer had developed a fermentation process for microbial 11β-oxygenation of steroids in a single step that could convert Substance S directly to 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol), with Syntex undertaking large-scale production of cortexolone at very low cost. [ 29 ] Oak Park and Julian Laboratories Around 1950 Julian moved his family from Chicago to the village of Oak Park, Illinois , where the Julians were the first African-American family. [ 35 ] Although some residents welcomed them into the community, there was also opposition by some. Their home was fire-bombed on Thanksgiving Day , 1950, before they moved in. After the Julians had moved to Oak Park, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951. The attacks galvanized the community and a community group was formed to support the Julians. [ 36 ] Julian's son later recounted that during these times, he and his father often kept watch over the family's property by sitting in a tree with a shotgun. [ 6 ] In 1953, Julian founded his own research firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought many of his best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone . To compete against Syntex , he would have to use the same Mexican yam as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Nazi European holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company. In July 1956, Julian and executives of two other American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam. [ 25 ] [ 37 ] The hearings resulted in Syntex signing a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department . While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised not to do so in the future. [ 25 ] Within five years, large American multinational pharmaceutical companies had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico. Four had been Mexican-owned. [ 25 ] Syntex reduced the cost of bulk progesterone as an intermediate more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955. [ 25 ] [ 37 ] Competition from Upjohn and General Mills , who had together made very substantial improvements in the production of progesterone from stigmasterol, forced the price of Mexican progesterone down to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957. The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968. [ 25 ] [ 29 ] In 1958, Upjohn purchased 6,900kg of progesterone from Syntex at $0.135 per gram, 6,201kg of progesterone from Searle (who had acquired Pesa) at $0.143 per gram, 5,150kg of progesterone from Julian Laboratories at $0.14 per gram, and 1,925kg of progesterone from General Mills (who had acquired Protex) at $0.142 per gram. [ 38 ] Despite continually falling bulk prices of steroid intermediates, an oligopoly of large American multinational pharmaceutical companies kept the wholesale prices of corticosteroid drugs fixed and unchanged into the 1960s. Cortisone was fixed at $5.48 per gram from 1954, hydrocortisone fixed at $7.99 per gram from 1954, and prednisone fixed at $35.80 per gram from 1956. [ 25 ] [ 38 ] Merck and Roussel Uclaf concentrated on improving the production of corticosteroids from cattle bile acids. In 1960 Roussel produced almost one-third of the world's corticosteroids from bile acids. [ 29 ] One year Julian Laboratories chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a product on which they were barely breaking even. Julian reduced their price for the product from $4,000 per kg down to $400 per kg. [ 6 ] He sold the company in 1961, for $2.3 million. [ 39 ] The U.S. and Mexico facilities were purchased by Smith Kline and Julian's chemical plant in Guatemala was purchased by Upjohn . In 1964, Julian founded Julian Associates and Julian Research Institute, which he managed for the rest of his life. [ 40 ] National Academy of Sciences He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973 in recognition of his scientific achievements. [ 6 ] He became the second African-American to be inducted, after David Blackwell . Death Julian died of liver cancer on April 19, 1975 in St. Theresa's Hospital in Waukegan, Illinois and was buried in Elm Lawn Cemetery in Elmhurst, Illinois . [ 9 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Legacy and honors In 1950, the Chicago Sun-Times named Percy Julian the Chicagoan of the Year. [ 11 ] From 1975, the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers has presented the Percy L. Julian Award for Pure and Applied Research in Science and Engineering. [ 43 ] In 1975, Percy L. Julian High School was opened on the south side of Chicago, Illinois as a Chicago Public High School. In 1985, Hawthorne School in Oak Park, Chicago , was renamed Percy Julian Middle School in his honor. [ 44 ] In 1980, the science and mathematics building on the DePauw University campus was rededicated as the Percy L. Julian Mathematics and Science Center. In Greencastle, Indiana , where DePauw is located, a street was named after Julian. Illinois State University, where Julian served on the board of trustees, named a hall after him. [ 45 ] In 1990, he was inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame . [ 46 ] In 1993 Julian was honored on a stamp issued by the United States Postal Service . [ 47 ] In 1999, the American Chemical Society recognized Julian's synthesis of physostigmine as a National Historic Chemical Landmark . [ 48 ] In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Percy Lavon Julian on his list of 100 Greatest African-Americans . [ 49 ] In 2011, the Qualifying Exam preparation committee at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was named for Percy Julian Nova documentary Ruben Santiago-Hudson portrayed Percy Julian in the Public Broadcasting Service Nova documentary about his life, called Forgotten Genius. It was presented on the PBS network on February 6, 2007, with initial sponsorship by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation and further funding by the National Endowment for the Humanities . Approximately sixty of Julian's family members, friends, and work associates were interviewed for the docudrama. [ 6 ] [ 50 ] Production on the biopic began at DePauw University 's Greencastle campus in May 2002, and included video of Julian's bust on display in the atrium of university's Percy Lavon Julian Science and Mathematics Center. Completion and broadcasting of the documentary program was delayed in order for Nova to commission and publish a matching book on Julian's life. [ 51 ] According to University of Illinois historian James Anderson in the film, "His story is a story of great accomplishment, of heroic efforts and overcoming tremendous odds... ...a story about who we are and what we stand for, and the challenges that have been there, and the challenges that are still with us."
