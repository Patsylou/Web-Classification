All Rights Reserved. Online ISBN: 9783527306732 DOI: 10.1002/14356007 About this Book ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Celebrating the centennial of the first edition in 2014 ! Welcome to ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry , the benchmark reference in chemistry and chemical and life science engineering. ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry is a state-of-the-art reference work detailing the science and technology in all areas of industrial chemistry. Subject areas include: inorganic and organic chemicals, advanced materials, pharmaceuticals, polymers and plastics, metals and alloys, biotechnology and biotechnological products, food chemistry, process engineering and unit operations, analytical methods, environmental protection, and many more. Fully international in scope and coverage, the contents have been compiled under the supervision of a renowned global Editorial Advisory Board . It contains over 1,000 major articles, written by some 3,000 authors who are experts in their fields and affiliated to leading chemical companies or research institutes. With more than 16 million words, nearly 15,000 tables, 25,000 figures, and innumerable literature sources and cross-references, ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia offers a wealth of comprehensive and well-structured information on all facets of industrial chemistry. History First published in 1914 by Professor Fritz Ullmann in Berlin, the Enzyklopdie der Technischen Chemie (as the German title read) quickly became the standard reference work in industrial chemistry. Generations of chemists have since relied on ULLMANN'S as their prime reference source. Further German editions followed in 1928 - 1932 and 1951 - 1970. The 25 volumes of the 4th Edition, published in 1972 - 1984, were divided into an alphabetically ordered series of 18 volumes and a general series of six volumes which gave an account of the principles and methods of chemical engineering and process technology. ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, was published from 1985 to 1996. This is the first edition that was published in the English language. ULLMANN'S Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 6th Edition, was published in December 2002. The 40 volumes including one index volume contained 800 major articles, organized in alphabetical order. Now in its 7th Edition, again in 40 volumes, ULLMANNS has had over 600 of its articles newly written or substantially updated, in addition to several hundred color figures added throughout. ULLMANN'S 7th Edition is available in print. Click here to find out more about the 40-Volume Set. ULLMANNS Online Since 1997, ULLMANNS Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry has also been available online, allowing easy round-the-clock access and regular content updates. The electronic encyclopedia offers a range of advanced functionalities: HTML format for easy browsing PDF format for printing Search for a word or phrase in the entire text, including highlighting of search terms Perform complicated searches using wildcards and Boolean operators Quality ranking and context display Follow cross references via hyperlinks New and updated articles are added to ULLMANN's Online on a quarterly basis. Since November 2011, over 1,100 articles are available online hundreds of new colour figures have been added a new Further Reading section is available the articles are easier to navigate From the reviews: The Sixth Edition is the culmination of 90 years experience and tradition, fully international in scope and presentation with articles of the highest quality. It deserves a place in every library that aspires to offer comprehensive reference material on industrial chemistry. I can recommend it without reservation. Angewandte Chemie In summary, the Encyclopedia is an excellent addition to a technical library. Its broad coverage provides the reader with an excellent source of up-to-date industrial chemistry information, and the reference citations provide an avenue to more detailed information. Journal of the American Chemical Society Ullmann's is an indispensable gold mine for students, patent attorneys, and researchers [...]. It should be readily available [...] at major public libraries and corporate collections. Today's Chemist at Work What's New Featured Article Micro Process Technology, 3. Applications Timothy Nol, Volker Hessel This article highlights a few important aspects of the use of micro process technology for chemical reactions. For example, thermoresponsive microcapsules can be made of a thermosensitive hydrogel and can encapsulate several water droplets. On temperature increase, the thermosensitive outer core shrinks and eventually bursts. Such materials are interesting for on-demand drug-release applications. 100 Years of Ullmann's: 1914 to 2014 Snapshots from the first Edition Sulfuric acid was one of the commercially most important bulk chemicals at the time, with a global production figure of 5 million tons annually during the early 1910s. The Falding-type plant shown here utilized the SO 2 -containing off-gases from the roasting of sulfidic iron ore.

Soil, Air, Water. A Journal of Sustainability and Environmental Safety CLEAN - Soil, Air, Water is a new, international and interdisciplinary journal covering all aspects of Sustainability and Environmental Safety. It hosts an attractive mixture of peer-reviewed scientific reviews, research papers, and short communications. Combining environmental aspects of soil, air, water, and sustainability technosphere the journal focuses on prevention measures and forward oriented approaches rather than on remediation and pollution cleanup. With editors from all over the world all of them are renowned specialists in their subjects and respective countries and by reflecting the rapid development of environmental sciences CLEAN aims to close the gap between developing and developed countries. Additionally, a magazine section provides an interesting variety of news, facts, personal profiles, forthcoming events and conferences as well as book reviews. Topical Issues bring readers up to date on recent developments on the most crucial areas of research and technological advances. CLEAN focuses on sustainability and environmental safety, analytical topics, processes, and engineering, pollution of the compartments soil, air, water and their boundaries as habitat resulting from interferences of technosphere with ecosphere, tools characterizing the pollutants from both analytical and ecotoxicological view points, recent developments on green chemistry and sustainability issues, holistic approaches, case studies, and best practices from developing and developed countries as examples. CLEAN aims to reflect the rapid development of environmental sciences and sustainability provide a link to emerging countries build a bridge between East and West and North and South encourage environmental scientists of emerging countries to scrutinize technologies and develop them further present holistic approaches and report case studies and best practices from developing and developed countries as examples Download Flyer Readership: agricultural scientists, biologists, biotechnologists, chemists, energy researchers, engineers, environmental chemists, ecologists, ecotoxicologists, environmental engineers, environmental health researchers, environmental scientists, hygienic physic Print ISSN: 1863-0650 Online ISSN: 1863-0669 Volume 42. 12 issues in 2014.

Advanced Synthesis Catalysis (ASC) is the leading primary journal in organic, organometallic, and applied chemistry. The high impact of ASC can be attributed to the unique focus of the journal, which publishes exciting new results from academic and industrial labs on efficient, practical, and environmentally friendly organic synthesis. While homogeneous, heterogeneous, organic, and enzyme catalysis are key technologies to achieve green synthesis, significant contributions to the same goal by synthesis design, reaction techniques, flow chemistry, and continuous processing, multiphase catalysis, green solvents, catalyst immobilization, and recycling, separation science, and process development are also featured in ASC. The Aims and Scope can be found in the Notice to Authors or on the first page of the table of contents in every issue.
