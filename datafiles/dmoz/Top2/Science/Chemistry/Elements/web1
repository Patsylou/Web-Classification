 UNDERSTANDING the periodic table, with its assemblage of columns and rows of elements, has been a perennial challenge for chemistry students. (See the below.) Understanding at the atomic level a remarkable row of elements has been a particular research challenge for Lawrence Livermore scientists over the years. That row is called the actinides, a collection of 14 radioactive elements named after the element actinium. "There's a tremendous amount we don't know about the actinides," says Lawrence Livermore chemist Lou Terminello, who leads the Materials Science and Technology Division of the Chemistry and Materials Science Directorate. To learn more about these elements, he says, the Department of Energy funds about $100 million per year for research at Lawrence Livermore. The research is conducted by teams of chemists, physicists, engineers, metallurgists, and environmental scientists on a diverse set of national security and environmental issues. Terminello says that a more fundamental understanding of actinides is needed to better assess the nation's nuclear stockpile, help stem the clandestine proliferation of nuclear weapons, and better understand the implications of nuclear fuels' (such as enriched uranium) use and storage. Environmental contamination by actinides is also a major concern at several major DOE facilities. In addition, actinides such as uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and americium are the major contributors to the long-term radioactivity of nuclear waste currently targeted for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada. Stockpile stewardship, DOE's program for certifying the long-term safety and performance of the enduring stockpile without underground nuclear testing, has heightened the importance of assessing and predicting the long-term behavior of actinides. A major focus is on obtaining a better scientific understanding of the isotopes uranium-235 and, especially, plutonium-239. Plutonium is the most complex and perplexing element in the periodic table. The element's complexity stems in part from its mercurial nature. Depending on temperature, it assumes one of six different forms or phases, each with a different density and volume. Because of plutonium's enigmatic behavior and the need for stringent safety and environmental procedures when handling the toxic material, much of the extensive characterization work done on other metals has not been performed on plutonium. Surrogates Inadequate Materials scientist Mike Fluss points out that because of plutonium's unpredictability, experimenters prefer not to use surrogate materials. "It's as challenging a material as you can imagine," he says. Even the process of measuring its electrical resistance has proven surprisingly complex because of its unexpected and not fully understood dependency upon temperature. "We're rebuilding plutonium metals science at Lawrence Livermore," says metallurgist Adam Schwartz. He points to a growing number of experiments measuring the structural, electrical, and chemical properties of plutonium and its alloys and determining how they change over time as a result of the cumulative effects of radioactive decay and consequential damage. These measurements will enable scientists to better model and predict the material's long-term behavior in the nation's aging nuclear stockpile. Schwartz also cites the recent acquisition of advanced instruments such as a transmission electron microscope capable of nearly perfect resolution at the atomic scale. Additionally, Livermore experts are taking advantage of one-of-a-kind facilities at Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne national laboratories, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and other DOE sites to more completely characterize the electronic and atomic structure of plutonium alloys and compounds. One line of research is studying the evolution of damage to plutonium metal's crystalline structure on scales as small as a billionth of a meter. This so-called microstructure is always changing because when plutonium-239 decays, it emits a 4-megaelectronvolt alpha particle (a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons) and an 85-kiloelectronvolt recoiling atom of uranium-235. The resulting buildup of gaseous helium atoms and displaced plutonium atoms from the recoiling uranium could produce unacceptable changes in the plutonium metal. Fluss notes that after 10 years, every plutonium atom has been displaced at least once from its lattice site, but most atoms eventually return there. The plutonium decay itself is slow; in about 24,000 years, only half the plutonium-239 has changed to uranium-235. The concern, says Fluss, is that atoms of helium and the actinides americium and uranium, also present in the weapon environment, might slowly change the chemistry of the plutonium metal. At the same time, the accumulation of small-scale radiation damage to plutonium alloys over several decades could affect a weapon's safety or its performance. Like other solids, plutonium metal is made of many crystals (or grains) with different orientations. If vacancies or defects coalesce, they may cause changes in properties, with possible unwanted effects to a warhead. By better understanding the nature of the changes, scientists can refine their predictive codes. 100-Year Predictions Needed "We need to know how plutonium in our stockpile will react over 100 years," says Fluss. "We're asking harder questions today because nuclear weapons must last a lot longer than their designers ever intended." The answer, he says, lies in obtaining fundamental understanding at the atomic level. Schwartz and colleague Mark Wall are using the transmission electron microscope to document the differences between plutonium from old, disassembled nuclear warheads and newly cast plutonium. By using electrons instead of light waves, the transmission electron microscope can image features at near-atomic resolution. They start with plutonium samples measuring less than 3 millimeters in diameter and 120 micrometers thick. The center of each sample is thinned to create a region only 100 nanometers (100 billionths of a meter) thick for the electron beam to pass through. The resulting electron micrographs reveal the nature and extent of defects in unprecedented detail. Researchers are also doing a variety of accelerated aging studies in which plutonium samples are exposed to higher than normal levels of radiation so that the aging process is significantly accelerated. Such experiments provide an important basis for validating computer models. Other aspects of the physics of radiation effects are being studied by ion irradiation using various light and heavy ions to investigate the predictions of the models. Lawrence Livermore scientists are also benefiting from fundamental work on plutonium performed by their colleagues in Russia. One study, done over the past 25 years and announced last year, claims to have produced plutonium's correct phase diagram, the roadmap between its six different phases or structural forms. The Russian study, says Schwartz, clarifies certain details about how delta-phase plutonium transforms to a less desired alpha state. Actinides Can Mean Nuclear Chemistry The group of elements known as the actinides are the elements from actinium (element 89) to lawrencium (element 103). All members of the series can resemble actinium in their chemical and electronic properties, and so they form a separate group within the periodic table. (An element's atomic number is the sum of the protons and neutrons in the nuclei of its atoms.) All actinides are metals and all are radioactive. As a result, they dominate the study of nuclear chemistry. The elements emit energy in the form of alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. By emitting these particles, the atoms lose protons and therefore become another element with a lower atomic number. If the immediate product of radioactive decay is radioactive, it also decays to form another element. This process continues until a stable element is formed. Actinides undergo radioactive decay at different rates; that is, they have different half-lives. Elements with higher atomic numbers have short half-lives and rapid radioactive decay. Some actinides with lower atomic numbers, however, have half-lives ranging between thousands to millions of years. The two actinides of most interest to Livermore scientists are uranium and plutonium. Uranium, a silver and lustrous metal, has four main isotopes. Because uranium-235 is fissionable, it is used to fuel nuclear power plants and as a component in nuclear weapons. Plutonium is a silver-gray metal that has 16 isotopes. The isotope of chief interest is plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is fissionable. Most nuclear weapons are based on plutonium-239, while plutonium-238 is used as a power source in long-mission space probes. New Look at Old Data According to nuclear chemist Ken Moody, new measuring techniques and instruments, along with improved understanding of actinide chemistry, warrant revisiting test data that are decades old. Moody is one of a dwindling number of nuclear chemists who did the original chemical separation of actinides from underground tests before they ceased in 1992. He notes that stored actinide samples and even debris from tests could be a treasure-trove of data, despite their reduced radioactivity due to age. The reanalysis could give stockpile stewards a clearer idea of how the nuclear devices performed when they were detonated and how those same designs would perform today. Lawrence Livermore's actinide forensics capabilities are formidable, Moody says. Radiochemical methods can reveal, for example, when a sample of plutonium was manufactured and even the chemical techniques used in its creation. They can also readily show if a suspect material is a hoax rather than a real threat. Creating Element 114 The accumulated knowledge of actinides' nuclear structure has helped Lawrence Livermore scientists create entirely new elements. In 1989, a Livermore team led by nuclear chemist Ken Hulet (now retired) began a collaboration with scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Over the past decade, the international team discovered isotopes of elements 106, 108, and 110 at the Russian institute. The researchers' goal in 1998 was far more challenging: to create element 114 and demonstrate a long-postulated region of enhanced nuclear stability against spontaneous fission. This region, considered by some impossible to reach, was theorized to lie amidst a "sea" of extremely short-lived, super-heavy nuclei. The most recent experiment, led by Moody, involved a team of five Livermore scientists and 17 Russian researchers. The team bombarded ions of the rare isotope calcium-48 onto a target of plutonium-244 (the heaviest long-lived plutonium isotope) supplied by Livermore. It took the team 40 days of irradiation to create one atom of the new super-heavy element 114 in December 1998. The new element lasted 30 seconds, some 100,000 times longer than if there were no enhanced stability in that area of the periodic table. Moody believes the discovery of element 114 has strengthened interest in heavy-element science. Since the discovery, Lawrence Berkeley researchers have found two new elements-116 and 118. The continuing discoveries are providing important insights into the arrangement of electrons in atoms and chemical bonding. Plutonium Moves Differently An important aspect of Lawrence Livermore actinide research is studying how these elements behave in the environment, particularly how they migrate underground in solution. The research results have challenged some long-established scientific assumptions. For example, scientists assumed that plutonium, because of its low solubility in water and its strong tendency to sorb (adhere) to clumps of dirt and rocks, does not travel far in groundwater. A Lawrence Livermore-Los Alamos team led by Livermore geochemist Annie Kersting has shown, however, that plutonium can adhere to colloids, which are naturally occurring particles of rock smaller than a micrometer in diameter. In this way, small amounts of plutonium can be transported considerable distances by groundwater. The team studied the distances plutonium ions had traveled from the Pahute Mesa region of DOE's Nevada Test Site. The group analyzed some of the groundwater pumped from two deep sampling wells dug near the sites where four underground nuclear tests had been conducted. The researchers discovered that colloids filtered from the water contained more than 99 percent of the small amount of plutonium found in the well-water samples. (In contrast, 99 percent of the tritium was found in solution, and virtually none was found in the filtrates.) The team proposed that small amounts of plutonium had adhered to mineral colloids that were transported by groundwater away from the test location. The team ascertained which of the four tests conducted in the area had produced the plutonium by measuring the ratio of the plutonium-240 isotope to the plutonium-239 isotope. (Every nuclear test can produce a unique ratio of the two plutonium isotopes.) The isotopic ratio measured on the groundwater colloids matched that of the 1968 Benham underground test, which was conducted 1.3 kilometers from one of the wells. "We were surprised to find that the plutonium in the wells was from the Benham test because 1.3 kilometers is a long distance for plutonium to migrate," says Kersting. She adds, however, that the detected plutonium concentration was extremely small and did not pose a health risk. The team's findings have important implications for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada (see S , March 2000 , Building a Virtual Time Machine .) The findings may also be applicable to other DOE sites such as Rocky Flats in Colorado and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington, although their underground geology differs from the Nevada Test Site's. In light of the team's research, Kersting says that models that do not allow for transport of plutonium by colloids may significantly underestimate how far and fast the element can travel. She also notes that colloids may be important in the transport of other actinides. "We want to know how other actinides such as neptunium, americium, and uranium move underground," she says. The colloid discovery, she says, emphasizes the importance of linking precisely controlled laboratory experiments with field studies. "If you only look at results from experiments in the laboratory, you won't necessarily understand what's happening in the field." From the arid stretches of the Nevada Test Site to physics research laboratories of Russia, Lawrence Livermore researchers are pursuing wide-ranging aspects of actinide science. They are combining theory, fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations on scales ranging from atoms to kilometers, all with the aim of uncovering the secrets of the actinides. Arnie Heller Educating Future Actinide Scientists The Department of Energy national laboratories have long been the stewards of expertise in actinides in the United States. However, many actinide experts are retired or in the process of retiring, and they are not being replaced in adequate numbers. The situation largely results from a sharp downturn in the number of students graduating with specialties in nuclear chemistry. Across the nation, only a few colleges and universities still provide facilities for actinide research, and professors teaching actinide science have mostly retired. Also, fewer undergraduates are expressing an interest in pursuing careers in nuclear chemistry. According to Livermore actinide experts, U.S. leadership in heavy-element science will fast erode unless the national laboratories address this issue, which is vital to DOE stockpile stewardship and other missions such as nuclear waste disposition. "One of the most important challenges facing stockpile stewardship is the successful passing of the torch in actinide science," says Lawrence Livermore chemist Lou Terminello. The University of California's Glenn T. Seaborg Institute for Transactinium Science is attempting to remedy the labor shortage by attracting and training the next generation of actinide scientists. The institute was established in 1991 with facilities at both Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories. (A third chapter was added in 1997 at Los Alamos National Laboratory.) The institute is named for the late UC Berkeley professor in recognition of his enormous contributions to the field, including the discovery of 10 elements, among them plutonium. The institute advances fundamental and applied science and technology of transactinium elements (actinides and beyond). Workshops, conferences, lectures, and research projects focus on national security, nuclear energy, environmental protection and remediation, and nuclear waste isolation and disposition. The institute emphases training at the undergraduate through postgraduate levels. In this way, says Terminello, who serves as institute director, Lawrence Livermore is making a long-term investment in its future. To that end, the institute's Livermore facility operates a summer school for undergraduates who have shown an interest in nuclear chemistry. "We want to capture the imagination of young people by giving them hands-on experience in nuclear science. We want them to go to graduate school and return to Livermore, where they will form our next generation of actinide scientists," Terminello says. Performing research on actinides for stockpile stewardship often requires training beyond that which is available from universities. As a result, the institute also trains chemists who have recently obtained a Ph.D. For example, young scientists are learning the techniques of x-ray absorption that were refined for actinides by Livermore chemists such as Patrick Allen, deputy director of the institute. The researchers use the facilities of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, a part of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The laboratory generates synchrotron radiation, a name given to x rays produced by electrons circulating in a storage ring at nearly the speed of light. The extremely bright x rays excite electrons closest to the nucleus, yielding detailed information about the chemical nature, molecular structure, and electron distribution of actinide-containing materials. Lawrence Livermore researchers use x-ray absorption to probe samples of uranium and plutonium alloys and compare the results to current computer models. The results are useful in addressing stockpile stewardship issues as well as understanding the behavior of actinides in contaminated soils and potential radioactive waste storage facilities.

Actinium glows in the dark due to its intense radioactivity with a blue light. Actinium was discovered in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne, a French chemist, who separated it from pitchblende. Friedrich Otto Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902. The chemical behavior of actinium is similar to that of the rare earth lanthanum . The word actinium comes from the Greek aktis, aktinos, meaning beam or ray. Applications It is about 150 times as radioactive as radium, making it valuable as a neutron source. Otherwise it has no significant industrial applications. Actinium-225 is used in medicine to produce Bi-213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radio-immunotherapy. Actinium in the environment It is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227-Ac, an α and β emitter with a half-life of 21.773 years. One ton of uranium ore contains about a tenth of a gram of actinium. Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but more commonly is made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226-Ra in a nuclear reactor. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300-degrees C. Naturally occurring actinium is composed of 1 radioactive isotope; with 227-Ac being the most abundant (100% natural abundance). 27 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 227-Ac with a half-life of 21.773 years, 225-Ac with a half-life of 10 days, and 226-Ac with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-life's that are less than 10 hours and the majority of these have half life's that are less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 meta states. Purified actinium-227 comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days, and then decays according to its 21.773-year half-life. The isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206 amu (206-actinium) to 234 amu (234-actinium). Health effects of actinium Actinium-227 is extremely radioactive, and in terms of its potential for radiation induced health effects, actinium-227 is about as dangerous as plutonium. Ingesting even small amounts of actinium-227 would represent a serious health hazard. The greatest threat of radioactivity to life as we know it is damage to the gene pool, the genetic make-up of all living species. Genetic damage from radiation exposure is cumulative over lifetimes and generations. Even low-dose exposures are carcinogenic after extended exposure. The current generation, the one in uterus, and all that follow may suffer cancers, immune system damage, leukemia, miscarriages, stillbirths, deformities, and fertility problems. While many of these health problems are on the rise, individuals cannot prove either increase in "background" radiation or specific exposure as the cause. Only epidemiological evidence is scientifically acceptable to impute cause. Perhaps the most extreme outcome over time would be simply the wholesale cessation of the ability to reproduce. Radiation is a known cause of sterility. Environmental effects of actinium The development of nuclear technology has been accompanied by gross as well as minute releases of radioactivity into the atmosphere, the soil, the oceans, seas, and water table, showing up worldwide in animal, vegetable, and inert matter. Radiation crosses species and concentrates through the food chain, subjecting other animals and humans to its damaging effects. Actinium-227 is extremely radioactive. Radioactivity damages the gene pool not only of humans, but of all living creatures, causing cancers, immune system damage, leukemia, miscarriages, stillbirths, deformities, and fertility problems. Furthermore, genetic damage from radiation exposure is cumulative over lifetimes and generations. Sources of periodic table . Back to the periodic table of elements .

It was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated. Polonium , radium and radon were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table . A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores as the isotope 227 Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta particles . One tonne of uranium ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 Ra in a nuclear reactor . Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.

He separated it from pitchblende residues left by Marie and Pierre Curie after they had extracted radium . In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to titanium [ 2 ] and (in 1900) as similar to thorium . [ 3 ] Friedrich Oskar Giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 [ 4 ] as a substance being similar to lanthanum and called it "emanium" in 1904. [ 5 ] After a comparison of the substances half-lives determined by Debierne, [ 6 ] Hariett Brooks in 1904, and Otto Hahn and Otto Sackur in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Articles published in the 1970s [ 9 ] and later [ 10 ] suggest that Debierne's results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. [ 11 ] A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. [ 10 ] He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89. The name actinium originates from the Ancient Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. [ 12 ] Its symbol Ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium, such as acetyl , acetate [ 13 ] and sometimes acetaldehyde . [ 14 ] Properties [ edit ] Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] radioactive , metallic element. Its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead . [ 17 ] Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. [ 18 ] Actinium has similar chemical properties as lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation. [ 19 ] The first element of the actinides , actinium gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides . The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1945 that Glenn T. Seaborg proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev 's periodic table , by introducing the actinides. [ 20 ] Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. [ 15 ] As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium exists in the oxidation state +3, and the Ac 3+ ions are colorless in solutions. [ 21 ] The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d 1 7s 2 electronic configuration of actinium, that is it easily donates 3 electrons assuming a stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon . [ 16 ] The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH 2 ). [ 22 ] Chemical compounds [ edit ] Only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including AcF 3 , AcCl 3 , AcBr 3 , AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac 2 S 3 , Ac 2 O 3 and AcPO 4 . Except for AcPO 4 , they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds and contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. [ 21 ] [ 23 ] In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.

Density was not measured directly but calculated from the lattice parameters. Oxides [ edit ] Actinium oxide (Ac 2 O 3 ) can be obtained by heating the hydroxide at 500 °C or the oxalate at 1100 °C, in vacuum. It crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals. [ 24 ] Halides [ edit ] Actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 °C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000 °C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 °C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product. [ 24 ] [ 29 ] AcF 3 + 2 NH 3 + H 2 O → AcOF + 2 NH 4 F Actinium trichloride is obtained by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960 °C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride can be prepared by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000 °C. However, in contrast to the oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia . [ 24 ] Reaction of aluminium bromide and actinium oxide yields actinium tribromide: Ac 2 O 3 + 2 AlBr 3 → 2 AcBr 3 + Al 2 O 3 and treating it with ammonium hydroxide at 500 °C results in the oxybromide AcOBr. [ 24 ] Other compounds [ edit ] Actinium hydride was obtained by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300 °C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH 2 hydride. The source of hydrogen in the reaction was uncertain. [ 30 ] Mixing monosodium phosphate (NaH 2 PO 4 ) with a solution of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO 4 ·0.5H 2 O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400 °C for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide Ac 2 S 3 . It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 °C. [ 24 ] Isotopes [ edit ] Main article: Isotopes of actinium Naturally occurring actinium is composed of one radioactive isotope ; 227 Ac . Thirty-six radioisotopes have been identified, the most stable being 227 Ac with a half-life of 21.772 years, 225 Ac with a half-life of 10.0 days and 226 Ac with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is 217 Ac (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through alpha decay and electron capture . Actinium also has two meta states . [ 31 ] Purified 227 Ac comes into equilibrium with its decay products at the end of 185 days. It decays according to its 21.772-year half-life emitting mostly beta (98.8%) and some alpha particles (1.2%); [ 21 ] the successive decay products are part of the actinium series . Owing to the low available amounts, low energy of its beta particles (46 keV) and low intensity of alpha radiation, 227 Ac is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products. [ 21 ] The isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 206 u ( 206 Ac ) to 236u ( 236 Ac ).

Actinium is found only in traces in uranium ores as 227 Ac – one tonne of ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The actinium isotope 227 Ac is a transient member of the actinium series decay chain , which begins with the parent isotope 235 U (or 239 Pu ) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207 Pb . Another actinium isotope ( 225 Ac) is transiently present in the neptunium series decay chain , beginning with 237 Np (or 233 U) and ending with thallium ( 205 Tl) and near-stable bismuth ( 209 Bi). The low natural concentration, and the close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. [ 24 ] Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 Ra in a nuclear reactor . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] The reaction yield is about 2% of the radium weight. 227 Ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of 228 Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone- benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). [ 32 ] An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid , which can result in a separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant . [ 35 ] 225 Ac was first produced artificially at the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) in Germany using a cyclotron and at St George Hospital in Sydney using a linac in 2000. [ 36 ] This rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium-226 target with 20–30 MeV deuterium ions. This reaction also yields 226 Ac which however decays with a half-life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate 225 Ac. [ 37 ] Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 °C. Higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of the product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation. Lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile. [ 12 ] [ 15 ] Applications [ edit ] Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium currently has no significant industrial use. [ 12 ] 227 Ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators , for example in spacecraft. The oxide of 227 Ac pressed with beryllium is also an efficient neutron source with the activity exceeding that of the standard americium-beryllium and radium-beryllium pairs. [ 38 ] In all those applications, 227 Ac (a beta source) is merely a progenitor which generates alpha-emitting isotopes upon its decay. Beryllium captures alpha particles and emits neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction: The 227 AcBe neutron sources can be applied in a neutron probe – a standard device for measuring the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Such probes are also used in well logging applications, in neutron radiography , tomography and other radiochemical investigations. [ 41 ] DOTA carrier for 225 Ac in radiation therapy. 225 Ac is applied in medicine to produce 213 Bi in a reusable generator [ 35 ] or can be used alone as an agent for radiation therapy , in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213 Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225 Ac itself, but also its decay products emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225 Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver for a period of tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225 Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its decay products might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225 Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N`,N``,N```,N````,N`````-hexaacetic acid) [ 42 ] or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor . The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia , lymphoma , breast , ovarian , neuroblastoma and prostate cancers . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] The medium half-life of 227 Ac (21.77 years) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters. The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235 U. Its decay product, 231 Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant. 231 Pa decays to 227 Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231 Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227 Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both 231 Pa and 227 Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Precautions [ edit ] 227 Ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a glove box . When actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats, about 33% of actinium is deposited into the bones and 50% into the liver. Its toxicity is comparable to, but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium.

From the Latin word for alum, alumen . Say what? Aluminum is pronounced as ah-LOO-men-em . History and Uses: Although aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust , it is never found free in nature. All of the earth's aluminum has combined with other elements to form compounds. Two of the most common compounds are alum, such as potassium aluminum sulfate (KAl(SO 4 ) 2 12H 2 O), and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ). About 8.2% of the earth's crust is composed of aluminum. Scientists suspected than an unknown metal existed in alum as early as 1787, but they did not have a way to extract it until 1825. Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish chemist, was the first to produce tiny amounts of aluminum. Two years later, Friedrich Whler, a German chemist, developed a different way to obtain aluminum. By 1845, he was able to produce samples large enough to determine some of aluminum's basic properties. Whler's method was improved in 1854 by Henri tienne Sainte-Claire Deville, a French chemist. Deville's process allowed for the commercial production of aluminum. As a result, the price of aluminum dropped from around $1200 per kilogram in 1852 to around $40 per kilogram in 1859. Unfortunately, aluminum remained too expensive to be widely used. Two important developments in the 1880s greatly increased the availability of aluminum. The first was the invention of a new process for obtaining aluminum from aluminum oxide. Charles Martin Hall, an American chemist, and Paul L. T. Hroult, a French chemist, each invented this process independently in 1886. The second was the invention of a new process that could cheaply obtain aluminum oxide from bauxite. Bauxite is an ore that contains a large amount of aluminum hydroxide (Al 2 O 3 3H 2 O), along with other compounds. Karl Joseph Bayer, an Austrian chemist, developed this process in 1888. The Hall-Hroult and Bayer processes are still used today to produce nearly all of the world's aluminum. With an easy way to extract aluminum from aluminum oxide and an easy way to extract large amounts of aluminum oxide from bauxite, the era of inexpensive aluminum had begun. In 1888, Hall formed the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which is now known as the Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa. When it opened, his company could produce about 25 kilograms of aluminum a day. By 1909, his company was producing about 41,000 kilograms of aluminum a day. As a result of this huge increase of supply, the price of aluminum fell rapidly to about $0.60 per kilogram. Today, aluminum and aluminum alloys are used in a wide variety of products: cans, foils and kitchen utensils, as well as parts of airplanes, rockets and other items that require a strong, light material. Although it doesn't conduct electricity as well as copper , it is used in electrical transmission lines because of its light weight. It can be deposited on the surface of glass to make mirrors, where a thin layer of aluminum oxide quickly forms that acts as a protective coating. Aluminum oxide is also used to make synthetic rubies and sapphires for lasers.

Aluminium versus aluminum Following up a Topical Words piece on the international spelling of what British English writes as sulphur , many American subscribers wrote in to ask about another element with two spellings: aluminium . alumina , which itself had only been named in English by the chemist Joseph Black in 1790. Black took it from the French, who had based it on alum , a white mineral that had been used since ancient times for dyeing and tanning, among other things. Chemically, this is potassium aluminium sulphate (a name which gives me two further opportunities to parade my British spellings of chemical names). alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum , and finally settling on aluminium in 1812. His classically educated scientific colleagues preferred aluminium right from the start, because it had more of a classical ring, and chimed harmoniously with many other elements whose names ended in ium , like potassium , sodium , and magnesium , all of which had been named by Davy. um continued in occasional use in Britain for a while, though that in ium soon predominated. In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Websters Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum , though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the nineteenth century was aluminium ; it was the preferred version in The Century Dictionary of 1889 and is the only spelling given in the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913. Searches in an archive of American newspapers show a most interesting shift. Up to the 1890s, both spellings appear in rough parity, though with the ium version slightly the more common, but after about 1895 that reverses quite substantially, with the decade starting in 1900 having the um spelling about twice as common as the alternative; in the following decade the ium spelling crashes to a few hundred compared to half a million examples of um ium to um took place progressively over a period starting in about 1895, when the metal began to be widely available and the word started to be needed in popular writing. It is easy to imagine journalists turning for confirmation to Websters Dictionary, still the most influential work at that time, and adopting its spelling. The official change in the US to the um spelling happened quite late: the American Chemical Society only adopted it in 1925, though this was clearly in response to the popular shift that had already taken place. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially standardised on aluminium in 1990, though this has done nothing, of course, to change the way people in the US spell it for day to day purposes.

Aluminum was the original name given to the element by Humphry Davy but others called it aluminum and that became the accepted name in Europe. However, in the USA the preferred name was aluminum and when the American Chemical Society debated on the issue, in 1925, it decided to stick with aluminum. Aluminum is a soft and lightweight metal. It has a dull silvery appearance, because of a thin layer of oxidation that forms quickly when it is exposed to air. Aluminum is nontoxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. Aluminum has only one naturally occurring isotope, aluminium-27, which is not radioactive. Applications A silvery and ductile member of the poor metal group of elements, aluminum is found primarily as the ore bauxite and is remarkable for its resistance to oxidation (aluminum is actually almost always already oxidized, but is usable in this form unlike most metals), its strength, and its light weight. Aluminum is used in many industries to make millions of different products and is very important to the world economy. Structural components made from aluminum are vital to the aerospace industry and very important in other areas of transportation and building in which light weight, durability, and strength are needed. The use of aluminum exceed that of any other metal except iron. Pure aluminum easily forms alloys with many elements such as copper , zinc , magnesium , manganese and silicon . N early all modern mirrors are made using a thin reflective coating of aluminum on the back surface of a sheet of float glass. Telescope mirrors are also coated with a thin layer of aluminum. Other applications are electrical transmission lines, and packaging (cans, foil, etc.). Because of its high conductivity and relatively low price compared to copper, aluminum was introduced for household electrical wiring to a large degree in the US in the 1960s. Unfortunately problems on the functioning were caused by its greater coefficient of thermal expansion and its tendency to creep under steady sustained pressure, both eventually causing loosening the connection; galvanic corrosion increasing the electrical resistance. The most recent development in aluminum technology is the production of aluminum foam by adding to the molten metal a compound (a metal hybrid), which releases hydrogen gas. The molten aluminum has to he thickened before this is done and this is achieved by adding aluminum oxide or silicon carbide fibers. The result is a solid foam which is used in traffic tunnels and in space shuttle. Aluminum in the environment Aluminum is an abundant element in Earth's crust: it is believed to be contained in a percentage from 7.5% to 8.1%. Aluminum is very rare in its free form. Aluminum contribute greatly to the properties of soil, where it is present mainly as insoluble aluminum hydroxide. Aluminum is a reactive metal and it is hard to extract it from its ore, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ). Aluminum is among the most difficult metals on earth to refine, the reason is that aluminum is oxidized very rapidly and that its oxide is an extremely stable compound that, unlike rust on iron, does not flake off. The very reason for which aluminum is used in many applications is why it is so hard to produce. Several gemstones are made of the clear crystal form of aluminum oxide known as corundum. The presence of traces of other metals creates various colors: cobalt creates blues sapphires, and chromium makes red rubies. Both these are now easy and cheap to manufacture artificially. Topaz is aluminum silicate coloured yellow by traces of iron. Recovery of this metal from scrap (via recycling) has become an important component of the aluminum industry. Industrial production world-wide of new metal is around 20 million tons per year, and a similar amount is recycled. Known reserves of ores are 6 billion tones. Health effects of aluminum Aluminum is one of the most widely used metals and also one of the most frequently found compounds in the earth's crust. Due to these facts, aluminum is commonly known as an innocent compound. But still, when one is exposed to high concentrations, it can cause health problems. The water-soluble form of aluminum causes the harmful effects, these particles are called ions. They are usually found in a solution of aluminum in combination with other ions, for instance as aluminum chlorine. The uptake of aluminum can take place through food, through breathing and by skin contact. Long lasting uptakes of significant concentrations of aluminum can lead to serious health effects, such as: - Damage to the central nervous system - Dementia - Loss of memory - Listlessness - Severe trembling Aluminum is a risk in certain working environments, such as mines, where it can be found in water. People that work in factories where aluminum is applied during production processes may endure lung problems when they breathe in aluminum dust. Aluminum can cause problems for kidney patients when it enters the body during kidney dialyses. Inhalation of finely divided aluminum and aluminum oxide powder has been reported as a cause of pulmonary fibrosis and lung damage. This effect, know as Shaver’s Disease, is complicated by the presence in the inhaled air of silica and oxides of iron . May also be implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Environmental effects of aluminum The effects of aluminum have drawn our attention, mainly due to the acidifying problems. Aluminum may accumulate in plants and cause health problems for animals that consume these plants. The concentrations of aluminum appear to be highest in acidified lakes. In these lakes the number of fish and amphibians is declining due to reactions of aluminum ions with proteins in the gills of fish and the embryo's of frogs. High aluminum concentrations do not only cause effects upon fish, but also upon birds and other animals that consume contaminated fish and insects and upon animals that breathe in aluminum through air. The consequences for birds that consume contaminated fish are eggshell thinning and chicks with low birth-weights. The consequences for animals that breathe in aluminum through air may be lung problems, weight loss and a decline in activity. Another negative environmental effect of aluminum is that its ions can react with phosphates, which causes phosphates to be less available to water organisms. High concentrations of aluminum may not only be found in acidified lakes and air, but also in the groundwater of acidified soils. There are strong indications that aluminum can damage the roots of trees when it is located in groundwater.

It is a silvery white, soft, ductile metal . Aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon ), and the most abundant metal , in the Earth 's crust . It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals . [ 5 ] The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite . Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation . Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the oxides and sulfates . Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically . In keeping with its pervasiveness, aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. [ 6 ] Owing to their prevalence, potential beneficial (or otherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.

It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of visible light and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far infrared radiation. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa , while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa. [ 7 ] Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel . It is easily machined , cast , drawn and extruded . Aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. Aluminium has a stacking-fault energy of approximately 200 mJ/m 2 . [ 8 ] Aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor , having 59% the conductivity of copper, both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of copper's density. Aluminium is capable of being a superconductor , with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 Kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss (10 milliteslas ). [ 9 ] Chemical Corrosion resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation . The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper . [ 7 ] This corrosion resistance is also often greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals. Owing to its resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retain silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of silver-colored paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200–400nm ( UV ) and the 3,000–10,000nm (far IR ) regions; in the 400–700nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the 700–3000 (near IR) by silver , gold , and copper . [ 10 ] Aluminium is oxidized by water to produce hydrogen and heat: 2 Al + 3 H 2 O → Al 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. Challenges include circumventing the formed oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction and the expenses associated with the storage of energy by regeneration of the Al metal. [ 11 ] Isotopes Main article: Isotopes of aluminium Aluminium has many known isotopes , whose mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only 27 Al ( stable isotope ) and 26 Al ( radioactive isotope, t 1/2 = 7.2×10 5 y ) occur naturally. 27 Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. 26 Al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic-ray protons . Aluminium isotopes have found practical application in dating marine sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, quartz in rock exposures, and meteorites . The ratio of 26 Al to 10 Be has been used to study the role of transport, deposition, sediment storage, burial times, and erosion on 10 5 to 10 6 year time scales. [ 12 ] Cosmogenic 26 Al was first applied in studies of the Moon and meteorites. Meteoroid fragments, after departure from their parent bodies, are exposed to intense cosmic-ray bombardment during their travel through space, causing substantial 26 Al production. After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces 26 Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that 26 Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26 Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago. [ 13 ] Natural occurrence See also: List of countries by bauxite production Stable aluminium is created when hydrogen fuses with magnesium either in large stars or in supernovae . [ 14 ] In the Earth's crust , aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by weight) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon). [ 15 ] Because of its strong affinity to oxygen, it is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. Feldspars , the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes. [ 16 ] Native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the South China Sea and Chen et al. (2011) [ 17 ] have proposed a theory of its origin as resulting by reduction from tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH) 4 – to metallic aluminium by bacteria . [ 17 ] It also occurs in the minerals beryl , cryolite , garnet , spinel and turquoise . Impurities in Al 2 O 3 , such as chromium or iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire , respectively. Although aluminium is an extremely common and widespread element, the common aluminium minerals are not economic sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite (AlO x (OH) 3–2 x ). Bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions. [ 18 ] Large deposits of bauxite occur in Australia, Brazil , Guinea and Jamaica and the primary mining areas for the ore are in Australia , Brazil, China , India , Guinea, Indonesia , Jamaica, Russia and Suriname . Production and refinement See also: Category:Aluminium minerals and List of countries by aluminium production iron minerals. Aluminium forms strong chemical bonds with oxygen. Compared to most other metals, it is difficult to extract from ore, such as bauxite , due to the high reactivity of aluminium and the high melting point of most of its ores. For example, direct reduction with carbon , as is used to produce iron , is not chemically possible because aluminium is a stronger reducing agent than carbon. Indirect carbothermic reduction can be carried out using carbon and Al 2 O 3 , which forms an intermediate Al 4 C 3 and this can further yield aluminium metal at a temperature of 1900–2000 °C. This process is still under development; it requires less energy and yields less CO 2 than the Hall-Héroult process , the major industrial process for aluminium extraction. [ 19 ] Electrolytic smelting of alumina was originally cost-prohibitive in part because of the high melting point of alumina, or aluminium oxide, (about 2,000°C (3,600°F)). Many minerals, however, dissolve into a second already molten mineral, even if the temperature of the melt is significantly lower than the melting point of the first mineral. Molten cryolite was discovered to dissolve alumina at temperatures significantly lower than the melting point of pure alumina without interfering in the smelting process. In the Hall-Héroult process , alumina is first dissolved into molten cryolite with calcium fluoride and then electrolytically reduced to aluminium at a temperature between 950 and 980 °C (1,740 to 1,800 °F). Cryolite is a chemical compound of aluminium and sodium fluorides : (Na 3 AlF 6 ). Although cryolite is found as a mineral in Greenland , its synthetic form is used in the industry. The aluminium oxide itself is obtained by refining bauxite in the Bayer process . The electrolytic process replaced the Wöhler process , which involved the reduction of anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium . Both of the electrodes used in the electrolysis of aluminium oxide are carbon. Once the refined alumina is dissolved in the electrolyte, it disassociates and its ions are free to move around. The reaction at the cathode is: Al 3+ + 3 e − → Al Here the aluminium ion is being reduced . The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off, usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing. At the anode , oxygen is formed: 2 O 2− → O 2 + 4 e − To some extent, the carbon anode is consumed by subsequent reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The anodes in a reduction cell must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process. The cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes and metal movement. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear. Aluminium electrolysis with the Hall-Héroult process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always less viable economically or ecologically. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 MJ /kg). The most modern smelters achieve approximately 12.8kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the heat of reaction , 31 MJ/kg, and the Gibbs free energy of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Reduction line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kiloamperes ; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells. [ citation needed ] The Hall-Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the Hoopes process . The process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the U.S. [ 22 ] Aluminum producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive—such as the United Arab Emirates with its large natural gas supplies, and Iceland and Norway with energy generated from renewable sources . The world's largest smelters of alumina are People's Republic of China, Russia, and Quebec and British Columbia in Canada . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 2005, the People's Republic of China was the top producer of aluminium with almost a one-fifth world share, followed by Russia, Canada, and the USA, reports the British Geological Survey . Over the last 50 years, Australia has become a major producer of bauxite ore and a major producer and exporter of alumina (before being overtaken by China in 2007). [ 23 ] [ 25 ] Australia produced 68 million tonnes of bauxite in 2010. The Australian deposits have some refining problems, some being high in silica, but have the advantage of being shallow and relatively easy to mine. [ 26 ] Recycling recycling code Main article: Aluminium recycling Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the International Resource Panel 's Metal Stocks in Society report , the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is 80kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (350–500kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (35kg per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling. Recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important use of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to the public awareness. Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as dross (ash-like oxide). [ 27 ] An aluminum stack melter produces significantly less dross, with values reported below 1%. [ 28 ] The dross can undergo a further process to extract aluminium. In Europe aluminium experiences high rates of recycling, ranging from 42% of beverage cans, 85% of construction materials and 95% of transport vehicles. [ 29 ] Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is for extrusion. White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially. [ 30 ] The process produces aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a mixture of gases (including, among others, hydrogen , acetylene , and ammonia ), which spontaneously ignites on contact with air; [ 31 ] contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste has found use as a filler in asphalt and concrete . [ 32 ] Compounds Oxidation state +3 The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The coordination number of such compounds varies, but generally Al 3+ is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless. [ 15 ] Halides All four trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, aluminium fluoride (AlF 3 ) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF 3 is related to the compactness of fluoride ion, six of which can fit around the small Al 3+ centre. AlF 3 sublimes (with cracking) at 1,291°C (2,356°F). With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. Acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centres, which are feature both halide and aquo ligands . When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as [AlF(H O) ] 2+ , AlF (H O) , and [AlF ] 3− . In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al 13 O 4 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12 ] 7+ . Oxide and hydroxides Aluminium forms one stable oxide, known by its mineral name corundum . Sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are boehmite and diaspore . There are three trihydroxides: bayerite , gibbsite , and nordstrandite , which differ in their crystalline structure ( polymorphs ). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful. Carbide, nitride, and related materials Aluminium carbide (Al 4 C 3 ) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1,000°C (1,832°F). The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centres. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane . The acetylide , Al 2 (C 2 ) 3 , is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium. Aluminium nitride (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral Al centres. It can be made from the elements at 800°C (1,472°F). It is air-stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity . Aluminium phosphide (AlP) is made similarly, and hydrolyses to give phosphine : AlP + 3 H 2 O → Al(OH) 3 + PH 3 Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides Main article: Organoaluminium compound trimethylaluminium , a compound that features five-coordinate carbon. A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR 3 and AlR 1.5 Cl 1.5 exist. [ 33 ] These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers, e.g. " trimethylaluminium " has the formula Al 2 (CH 3 ) 6 (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as triisobutylaluminium . Such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric . Few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds except for large organic groups. The important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH 4 ), which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry . It can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride: 4 LiH + AlCl 3 → LiAlH 4 + 3 LiCl Several useful derivatives of LiAlH 4 are known, e.g. sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate . The simplest hydride, aluminium hydride or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH 3 ) n , in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride with the formula (BH 3 ) 2 . Oxidation states +1 and +2 Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al 3+ centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al 3+ species. Aluminium(I) AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition AlI is unstable at room temperature with respect to the triiodide: [ 34 ] 3 AlI → AlI 3 + 2 Al A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine , Al 4 I 4 (NEt 3 ) 4 . Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al 2 O and Al 2 S. Al 2 O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al 2 O 3 , with silicon at 1,800°C (3,272°F) in a vacuum . [ 34 ] Such materials quickly disproportionates to the starting materials. Aluminium(II) Very simple Al(II) compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of Al metal with oxidants. For example, aluminium monoxide , AlO, has been detected in the gas phase after explosion [ 35 ] and in stellar absorption spectra. [ 36 ] More thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula R 4 Al 2 where R is a large organic ligand . [ 37 ] Analysis The presence of aluminium can be detected in qualitative analysis using aluminon . Applications General use Aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal . [ 38 ] Global production of aluminium in 2005 was 31.9 million tonnes. It exceeded that of any other metal except iron (837.5 million tonnes). [ 39 ] Forecast for 2012 is 42–45 million tonnes, driven by rising Chinese output. [ 40 ] Aluminium is almost always alloyed, which markedly improves its mechanical properties, especially when tempered . For example, the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium. [ 41 ] The main alloying agents are copper, zinc , magnesium , manganese , and silicon (e.g., duralumin ) and the levels of these other metals are in the range of a few percent by weight. [ 42 ] aluminium foil Austin "A40 Sports" (c. 1951) Some of the many uses for aluminium metal are in: Transportation ( automobiles , aircraft, trucks , railway cars , marine vessels, bicycles , etc.) as sheet, tube, castings, etc. Packaging ( cans , foil, frame of etc.) Construction ( windows , doors , siding , building wire, etc.). [ 43 ] A wide range of household items, from cooking utensils to baseball bats , watches. [ 44 ] Street lighting poles, sailing ship masts , walking poles , etc. Outer shells of consumer electronics, also cases for equipment e.g. photographic equipment, MacBook Pro 's casing Electrical transmission lines for power distribution MKM steel and Alnico magnets Super purity aluminium (SPA, 99.980% to 99.999% Al), used in electronics and CDs . Heat sinks for electronic appliances such as transistors and CPUs . Substrate material of metal-core copper clad laminates used in high brightness LED lighting . Powdered aluminium is used in paint , and in pyrotechnics such as solid rocket fuels and thermite . Aluminium can be reacted with hydrochloric acid or with sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen gas. A variety of countries, including France , Italy , Poland , Finland , Romania , Israel , and the former Yugoslavia , have issued coins struck in aluminium or aluminium-copper alloys. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Some guitar models sport aluminium diamond plates on the surface of the instruments, usually either chrome or black. Kramer Guitars and Travis Bean are both known for having produced guitars with necks made of aluminium, which gives the instrument a very distinct sound. Aluminium is usually alloyed – it is used as pure metal only when corrosion resistance and/or workability is more important than strength or hardness. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited onto a flat surface by physical vapour deposition or (very infrequently) chemical vapour deposition or other chemical means to form optical coatings and mirrors . Aluminium compounds Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications. Alumina Main article: Aluminium oxide Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. About 10% of the production capacity is used for other applications. A major use is as an absorbent. For example, alumina removes water from hydrocarbons, which enables subsequent processes that are poisoned by moisture. Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes, e.g. the Claus process for converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and for the alkylation of amines . Many industrial catalysts are "supported" , meaning generally that an expensive catalyst (e.g., platinum ) is dispersed over a high surface area material such as alumina. Being a very hard material ( Mohs hardness 9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive and the production of applications that exploit its inertness, e.g., in high pressure sodium lamps. Sulfates Several sulfates of aluminium find applications. Aluminium sulfate (Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 (H 2 O) 18 ) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in water treatment . The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a mordant, in fire extinguisher , as a food additive, in fireproofing, and in leather tanning. Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called ammonium alum , (NH 4 )Al(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O, is used as a mordant and in leather tanning. [ 6 ] Aluminium potassium sulfate ([Al(K)](SO 4 ) 2 )(H 2 O) 12 is used similarly. The consumption of both alums is declining. Chlorides Aluminium chloride (AlCl 3 ) is used in petroleum refining and in the production of synthetic rubber and polymers. Although it has a similar name, aluminium chlorohydrate has fewer and very different applications, e.g. as a hardening agent and an antiperspirant . It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal. Niche compounds Given the scale of aluminium compounds, a small scale application could still involve thousands of tonnes. One of the many compounds used at this intermediate level include aluminium acetate , a salt used in solution as an astringent . Aluminium borate (Al 2 O 3 ·B 2 O 3 ) is used in the production of glass and ceramics . Aluminium fluorosilicate (Al 2 (SiF 6 ) 3 ) is used in the production of synthetic gemstones , glass and ceramic. Aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4 ) is used in the manufacture: of glass and ceramic, pulp and paper products, cosmetics , paints and varnishes and in making dental cement . Aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH) 3 ) is used as an antacid , as a mordant, in water purification, in the manufacture of glass and ceramic and in the waterproofing of fabrics. Lithium aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry . Organoaluminiums are used as Lewis acids and cocatalysts. For example, methylaluminoxane is a cocatalyst for Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl polymers such as polyethene . Aluminium alloys in structural applications Main article: Aluminium alloy Aluminium foam Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ( ANSI ) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ( DIN and ISO ). The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation. One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their fatigue strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined fatigue limit , meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. This implies that engineers must assess these loads and design for a fixed life rather than an infinite life. Another important property of aluminium alloys is their sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures involving heating are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Forming operations where a blow torch is used therefore require some expertise, since no visual signs reveal how close the material is to melting. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, also are subject to internal stresses following heating operations such as welding and casting. The problem with aluminium alloys in this regard is their low melting point , which make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Controlled stress relief can be done during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect annealing the stresses. The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded their use in rocketry; even for use in constructing combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500K. The Agena upper stage engine used a regeneratively cooled aluminium design for some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region. Another alloy of some value is aluminium bronze (Cu-Al alloy). History Anteros (commonly mistaken for either The Angel of Christian Charity or Eros ) in Piccadilly Circus , London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium. Ancient Greeks and Romans used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds; alum is still used as a styptic . In 1761, Guyton de Morveau suggested calling the base alum alumine. In 1808, Humphry Davy identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed alumium and later aluminum (see etymology section , below). The metal was first produced in 1825 in an impure form by Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted . He reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam , yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin. [ 47 ] Friedrich Wöhler was aware of these experiments and cited them, but after redoing the experiments of Ørsted he concluded that this metal was pure potassium. He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and yielded aluminium. [ 47 ] Wöhler is generally credited with isolating aluminium ( Latin alumen , alum). Further, Pierre Berthier discovered aluminium in bauxite ore and successfully extracted it. [ 48 ] [ betterneeded ] Frenchman Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville improved Wöhler's method in 1846, and described his improvements in a book in 1859, chief among these being the substitution of sodium for the considerably more expensive potassium. [ 49 ] Deville likely also conceived the idea of the electrolysis of aluminium oxide dissolved in cryolite; Charles Martin Hall and Paul Héroult might have developed the more practical process after Deville. Prior to commercial electrical generation in the early 1880s, and the Hall-Héroult process in the mid 1880s, aluminium was exceedingly difficult to extract from its various ores . This made pure aluminium more valuable than gold. [ 50 ] Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1855 . [ 51 ] Napoleon III of France is reputed to have given a banquet where the most honoured guests were given aluminium utensils, while the others made do with gold. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Aluminium was selected as the material to use for the 100 ounce (2.8kg) capstone of the Washington Monument in 1884, a time when one ounce (30grams) cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project. [ 54 ] The capstone, which was set in place on December 6, 1884, in an elaborate dedication ceremony, was the largest single piece of aluminium cast at the time, when aluminium was as expensive as silver. [ 54 ] The Cowles companies supplied aluminium alloy in quantity in the United States and England using smelters like the furnace of Carl Wilhelm Siemens by 1886. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Charles Martin Hall of Ohio in the U.S. and Paul Héroult of France independently developed the Hall-Héroult electrolytic process that made extracting aluminium from minerals cheaper and is now the principal method used worldwide. Hall's process, [ 58 ] in 1888 with the financial backing of Alfred E. Hunt , started the Pittsburgh Reduction Company today known as Alcoa . Héroult's process was in production by 1889 in Switzerland at Aluminium Industrie, now Alcan , and at British Aluminium , now Luxfer Group and Alcoa, by 1896 in Scotland . [ 59 ] By 1895, the metal was being used as a building material as far away as Sydney , Australia in the dome of the Chief Secretary's Building . With the explosive expansion of the airplane industry during World War I (1914-1917), major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light, strong airframes. They often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems. [ 60 ] Many navies have used an aluminium superstructure for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard USS Belknap that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the Falklands War , led to many navies switching to all steel superstructures. The Arleigh Burke class was the first such U.S. ship, being constructed entirely of steel. Aluminium wire was once widely used for domestic electrical wiring. Owing to corrosion-induced failures, a number of fires resulted. Etymology Two variants of the metal's name are in current use, aluminium ( pronunciation: / ˌ æ l (j) ʊ ˈ m ɪ n iː ə m / ) and aluminum ( / ə ˈ l uː m ɪ n ə m / )—besides the obsolete alumium . The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both. [ 61 ] IUPAC prefers the use of aluminium in its internal publications, although nearly as many IUPAC publications use the spelling aluminum . [ 62 ] Most countries use the spelling aluminium . In the United States and Canada, the spelling aluminum predominates. [ 15 ] [ 63 ] The Canadian Oxford Dictionary prefers aluminum , whereas the Australian Macquarie Dictionary prefers aluminium . In 1926, the American Chemical Society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as "chiefly British". [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The various names all derive from its status as a base of alum . It is borrowed from Old French ; its ultimate source, alumen , in turn is a Latin word that literally means "bitter salt". [ 66 ] The earliest citation given in the Oxford English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium , which British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral alumina . The citation is from the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London : "Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium." [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Davy settled on aluminum by the time he published his 1812 book Chemical Philosophy : "This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina." [ 69 ] But the same year, an anonymous contributor to the Quarterly Review , a British political-literary journal, in a review of Davy's book, objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium , "for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound." [ 70 ] The -ium suffix conformed to the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, -um spellings for elements were not unknown at the time, as for example platinum , known to Europeans since the 16th century, molybdenum , discovered in 1778, and tantalum , discovered in 1802. The -um suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide (as opposed to aluminia), as lanthana is the oxide of lanthanum , and magnesia , ceria , and thoria are the oxides of magnesium , cerium , and thorium respectively. The spelling used throughout the 19th century by most U.S. chemists was aluminium , but common usage is less clear. [ 71 ] The aluminum spelling is used in the Webster's Dictionary of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal 1892, Charles Martin Hall used the -um spelling, despite his constant use of the -ium spelling in all the patents [ 58 ] he filed between 1886 and 1903. [ 72 ] It has consequently been suggested [ by whom? ] that the spelling reflects an easier to pronounce word with one fewer syllable, or that the spelling on the flier was a mistake. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that the spelling aluminum became the standard in North America. Health concerns NFPA 704 0 0 0 Fire diamond for aluminium shot Despite its natural abundance, aluminium has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic, aluminium sulfate having an LD50 of 6207mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500grams for an 80kg person. [ 6 ] The extremely low acute toxicity notwithstanding, the health effects of aluminium are of interest in view of the widespread occurrence of the element in the environment and in commerce. Some toxicity can be traced to deposition in bone and the central nervous system, which is particularly increased in patients with reduced renal function. Because aluminium competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminium may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation. In very high doses, aluminium can cause neurotoxicity , and is associated with altered function of the blood–brain barrier . [ 73 ] A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis , digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium, such as antipersperants or antacids. In those without allergies, aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals , but there is evidence of some toxicity if it is consumed in excessive amounts. [ 74 ] Although the use of aluminium cookware has not been shown to lead to aluminium toxicity in general, excessive consumption of antacids containing aluminium compounds and excessive use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants provide more significant exposure levels. Studies have shown that consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium significantly increases aluminium absorption, [ 75 ] and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nervous and osseus tissue. [ 76 ] Furthermore, aluminium increases estrogen -related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. [ 77 ] The estrogen-like effects of these salts have led to their classification as a metalloestrogen . The effects of aluminium in antiperspirants has been examined over the course of decades with little evidence of skin irritation. [ 6 ] Nonetheless, its occurrence in antiperspirants , dyes (such as aluminium lake ), and food additives is controversial in some quarters. This article contains weasel words : vague phrasing that often accompanies biased or unverifiable information . Such statements should be clarified or removed . (February 2014) Although there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adults, [ 78 ] some studies point to risks associated with increased exposure to the metal. [ 79 ] Aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water. [ 80 ] Some researchers have expressed concerns that the aluminium in antiperspirants may increase the risk of breast cancer, [ 81 ] and aluminium has controversially been implicated as a factor in Alzheimer's disease . [ 82 ] The Camelford water pollution incident involved a number of people consuming aluminium sulfate . Investigations of the long-term health effects are still ongoing, but elevated brain aluminium concentrations have been found in post-mortem examinations of victims, and further research to determine if there is a link with cerebral amyloid angiopathy has been commissioned. [ 83 ] According to the Alzheimer's Society , the medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and Alzheimer's disease. [ 84 ] Nevertheless, some studies, such as those on the PAQUID cohort , [ 85 ] cite aluminium exposure as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease . Some brain plaques have been found to contain increased levels of the metal. [ 86 ] Research in this area has been inconclusive; aluminium accumulation may be a consequence of the disease rather than a causal agent. In any event, if there is any toxicity of aluminium, it must be via a very specific mechanism, since total human exposure to the element in the form of naturally occurring clay in soil and dust is enormously large over a lifetime. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Scientific consensus does not yet exist about whether aluminium exposure could directly increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. [ 84 ] In case of suspected sudden intake of large amount of aluminium, deferoxamine mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation . [ 89 ] Effect on plants Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acid soils. Although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH-neutral soils, the concentration in acid soils of toxic Al 3+ cations increases and disturbs root growth and function. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than hydrogen ions . The acidity of the soil is therefore a result of hydrolysis of aluminium compounds. [ 94 ] This concept of "corrected lime potential" [ 95 ] to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in soil testing laboratories to determine the " lime requirement" [ 96 ] of soils. [ 97 ] Wheat 's adaptation to allow aluminium tolerance is such that the aluminium induces a release of organic compounds that bind to the harmful aluminium cations . Sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat. It was shown that sorghum's aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene, as for wheat. [ 98 ] This is not the case in all plants. Biodegradation The fungi Geotrichum candidum has been found to consume the aluminum in compact discs . [ 99 ] [ 100 ] The bacteria Ps. Acruginosa and the fungi C. resinae are commonly detected in aircraft engines, and can degrade aluminum in cultures.

 WebElementsPeriodic Table Aluminium Essential information Aluminium WebElements: the periodic table on the web Posters T-shirts Education Mugs Elements Compounds Periodicity News Shop Chemdex Aluminium: the essentials Pure aluminium is a silvery-white metal with many desirable characteristics. It is light, nontoxic (as the metal), nonmagnetic and nonsparking. It is somewhat decorative. It is easily formed, machined, and cast. Pure aluminium is soft and lacks strength, but alloys with small amounts of copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese, and other elements have very useful properties. Aluminium is an abundant element in the earth's crust, but it is not found free in nature. The Bayer process is used to refine aluminium from bauxite, an aluminium ore. Table: basic information about and classifications of aluminium. Name : Aluminium Symbol : Al Atomic number : 13 Atomic weight : 26.9815386 (8) Standard state : solid at 298 K CAS Registry ID : 7429-90-5 Group in periodic table : 13 Group name : (none) Period in periodic table : 3 Block in periodic table : p-block Colour : silvery Classification : Metallic Advent Research Materials via their web catalogue. Aluminium: historical information Aluminium was discovered by Hans Christian Oersted at 1825 in Denmark. Origin of name : from the Latin word " alumen " meaning " alum ". The ancient Greeks and Romans used alum in medicine as an astringent, and in dyeing processes. In 1761 de Morveau proposed the name "alumine" for the base in alum. In 1807, Davy proposed the name alumium for the metal, undiscovered at that time, and later agreed to change it to aluminum. Shortly thereafter, the name aluminium was adopted by IUPAC to conform with the "ium" ending of most elements. Aluminium is the IUPAC spelling and therefore the international standard. Aluminium was also the accepted spelling in the U.S.A. until 1925, at which time the American Chemical Society decided to revert back to aluminum, and to this day Americans still refer to aluminium as "aluminum". Aluminium is one of the elements which as alum or alumen, KAl(SO 4 ) 2 , has an alchemical symbol (the symbol to the right shows Scheele's symbol, alchemy is an ancient pursuit concerned with, for instance, the transformation of other metals into gold). Aluminium was first isolated by Hans Christian Oersted in 1825 who reacted aluminium chloride (AlCl 3 ) with potassium amalgam (an alloy of potassium and mercury). Heating the resulting aluminium amalgam under reduced pressure caused the mercury to boil away leaving an impure sample of aluminium metal.

Aluminium is mined in huge scales as bauxite (typically Al 2 O 3 .2H 2 O). Bauxite contains Fe 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , and other impurities. In order to isolate pure aluminium, these impurities must be removed from the bauxite. This is done by the Bayer process. This involves treatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, which results in a solution of sodium aluminate and sodium silicate. The iron remains behind as a solid. When CO 2 is blown through the resulting solution, the sodium silicate stays in solution while the aluminium is precipitated out as aluminium hydroxide. The hydroxide can be filtered off, washed, and heated to form pure alumina, Al 2 O 3 . The next stage is formation of pure aluminium. This is obtained from the pure Al 2 O 3 by an electrolytic method. Electrolysis is necessary as aluminium is so electropositive. It seems these days that electrolysis of the hot oxide in a carbon lined steel cell acting as the cathode with carbon anodes is most common.

Named for the Americas. Say what? Americium is pronounced as am-er-ISH-ee-em . History and Uses: Americium was discovered in 1944 by the American scientists Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, Leon O. Morgan and Albert Ghiorso. They produced americium by bombarding plutonium -239, an isotope of plutonium, with high energy neutrons . This formed plutonium-240, which was itself bombarded with neutrons. The plutonium-240 changed into plutonium-241, which then decayed into americium-241 through beta decay . This work was carried out at the University of Chicago 's Metallurgical Laboratory, now known as Argonne National Laboratory . Americium's most stable isotope , americium-243, has a half-life of about 7,370 years. It decays into neptunium -239 through alpha decay . Americium can be produced in kilogram quantities and has a few practical uses. It is used in smoke detectors and can be used as a portable source of gamma rays. Americium-241, with a half-life of 432.2 years, is used in these products because it is easier to produce relatively pure samples of this isotope.

Seaborg in 1945 Americium Americium is a silvery-white synthetic metal. It slowly tarnishes in dry air, but it is resistent to alkalis. It is denser than lead. Several americium compounds have been made and these are generally coloured - for example, the chloride is pink. Applications Americium has some uses: it is used in some smoke detectors, as portable gamma ray source in radiography, to help to create flat glass. However this isotope is extremely expensive to produce in usable quantities. Americium in the environment Americium probably does occur naturally on Earth, but only in incredibly tiny amounts in uranium minerals where nuclear reactions may occasionally produce an atom. There are no natural sources of americium, but it is likely to have been present at times in the past when local concentrations of uranium where sufficient to cause nuclear reactions. Americium can be added during accidental release in nuclear production plants. Americium, as the isotope americium-243, is produced in kilogram quantities from plutonim-239. Health effects of americium Humans may be exposed to higher concentrations of americium through food, breathing or skin contact, because of the release of americium during nuclear production and nuclear accidents. People that work in nuclear power plants and people that live near nuclear power plants may be exposed to higher levels of americium. The radiation from exposure to americium is the primary cause of health effects from absorbed americium. Americium moves rapidly through the body after uptake and is concentrated within the bones for a long period of time. During this storage americium will slowly decay and release radioactive particles and rays. These rays can cause alteration of genetic materials and bone cancers. Damage to organs due to americium exposure is highly unlikely for humans, because americium is accumulated in organs only a short period of time. Environmental effects of americium Americium consists mainly of manmade radioactive isotopes. These may be present in soils and waters in very small amounts as a result of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to the nuclear test ban of 1963. Americium from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests may remain in the atmosphere for decades travelling all around the world and settling slowly to earth. Its isotopes decay very slowly in the environment and as a result they can do harm to plants and animals. When animals are exposed to extreme levels of americium, results may be damage to organs such as the lungs, liver and thyroid. Americium that is present in soils may end up in plants, but only in small amounts. Usually americium particles are stored in parts of the plant that animals will not eat. Within fish very little americium builds up in the flesh or other edible parts and as a result it will not accumulate within food chains.

This transuranic element of the actinide series is located in the periodic table below the lanthanide element europium , and thus by analogy was named after another continent, America . [ 2 ] Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley . Although it is the third element in the transuranic series , it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium . The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors , as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242m Am, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer . Americium is a relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance. Its most common isotopes are 241 Am and 243 Am. In chemical compounds, they usually assume the oxidation state +3, especially in solutions. Several other oxidation states are known, which range from +2 to +7 and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra. The crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contains intrinsic defects, which are induced by self-irradiation with alpha particles and accumulate with time; this results in a drift of some material properties.

Seaborg , Leon O. Morgan, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso . They used a 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. [ 4 ] The element was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National Laboratory ) of the University of Chicago . Following the lighter neptunium , plutonium , and heavier curium , americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered. At the time, the periodic table had been restructured by Seaborg to its present layout, containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one. This led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium; it was thus by analogy named after another continent, America : "The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series." [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The new element was isolated from its oxides in a complex, multi-step process. First plutonium -239 nitrate ( 239 PuNO 3 ) solution was coated on a platinum foil of about 0.5cm 2 area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide (PuO 2 ) by annealing. After cyclotron irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid , and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution . The residue was dissolved in perchloric acid . Further separation was carried out by ion exchange , yielding a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the Berkeley group as pandemonium (from Greek for all demons or hell ) and delirium (from Latin for madness ). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes: 241 Am, 242 Am, 239 Am and 238 Am. Americium-241 was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of one neutron. It decays by emission of a α-particle to 237 Np; the half-life of this decay was first determined as 510 ± 20 years but then corrected to 432.2 years. [ 12 ] The times are half-lives The second isotope 242 Am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already-created 241 Am. Upon rapid β-decay , 242 Am converts into the isotope of curium 242 Cm (which had been discovered previously). The half-life of this decay was initially determined at 17 hours, which was close to the presently accepted value of 16.02 h. [ 12 ] The discovery of americium and curium in 1944 was closely related to the Manhattan Project ; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the Quiz Kids , five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. [ 8 ] After the discovery of americium isotopes 241 Am and 242 Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. [ 13 ] The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at 1100°C. [ 14 ] Occurrence [ edit ] See also: Nuclear reprocessing Ivy Mike nuclear test. The longest-lived and most common isotopes of americium, 241 Am and 243 Am, have half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370 years, respectively. Therefore, all primordial americium (americium that was present on Earth during its formation) should have decayed by now. Existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster . For example, the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb , Ivy Mike , (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll ), revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium; due to military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956. [ 15 ] Trinitite , the glassy residue left on the desert floor near Alamogordo , New Mexico , after the plutonium -based Trinity nuclear bomb test on 16 July 1945, contains traces of americium-241. Elevated levels of americium were also detected at the crash site of a US B-52 bomber, which carried four hydrogen bombs, in 1968 in Greenland . [ 16 ] In other regions, the average radioactivity of surface soil due to residual americium is only about 0.01 picocuries /g (0.37 mBq /g). Atmospheric americium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils. [ 17 ] Americium is produced mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241 Am and 243 Am. [ 18 ] Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, have to be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation , but it is still being developed for americium. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] A few atoms of americium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium -bearing deposits. [ 21 ] Synthesis and extraction [ edit ] Isotope nucleosyntheses [ edit ] Chromatographic elution curves revealing the similarity between the lanthanides Tb, Gd, and Eu and the corresponding actinides Bk, Cm, and Am. Americium has been produced in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241 Am and 243 Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. [ 22 ] Nevertheless, since it was first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241 Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. [ 23 ] The heavier isotope 243 Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Americium is not synthesized directly from uranium – the most common reactor material – but from the plutonium isotope 239 Pu. The latter needs to be produced first, according to the following nuclear process: The capture of two neutrons by 239 Pu (a so-called (n,γ) reaction), followed by a β-decay, results in 241 Am: The plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel contains about 12% of 241 Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to 241 Am, 241 Pu can be extracted and may be used to generate further 241 Am. [ 23 ] However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241 Pu decays to 241 Am after about 15 years, and the 241 Am amount reaches a maximum after 70 years. [ 26 ] The obtained 241 Am can be used for generating heavier americium isotopes by further neutron capture inside a nuclear reactor. In a light water reactor (LWR), 79% of 241 Am converts to 242 Am and 10% to its nuclear isomer 242m Am: [ note 1 ] [ 27 ] 79%: 10%: Americium-242 has a half-life of only 16 hours, which makes its further up-conversion to 243 Am, extremely inefficient. The latter isotope is produced instead in a process where 239 Pu captures four neutrons under high neutron flux : Metal generation [ edit ] Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes in oxide forms, from which isotopes of americium need to be separated. In a typical procedure, the spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel ) is dissolved in nitric acid , and the bulk of uranium and plutonium is removed using a PUREX -type extraction ( P lutonium – UR anium EX traction) with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon . The lanthanides and remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ( raffinate ) by a diamide -based extraction, to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Americium compounds are then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques [ 28 ] with an appropriate reagent. A large amount of work has been done on the solvent extraction of americium. For example, a recent EU funded project codenamed "EUROPART" studied triazines and other compounds as potential extraction agents. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Bis -triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent as highly selective to americium (and curium). [ 34 ] Separation of americium from the highly similar curium can be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone , at elevated temperatures. Both Am and Cm are mostly present in solutions in the +3 valence state; whereas curium remains unchanged, americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes which can be washed away. [ 35 ] Metallic americium is obtained by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride was first used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten . [ 14 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] An alternative is the reduction of americium dioxide by metallic lanthanum or thorium : [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Physical properties [ edit ] In the periodic table , americium is located to the right of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium , with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm 3 , americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm 3 ) and plutonium (19.8g/cm 3 ); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm 3 )—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. [ 39 ] Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C). [ 38 ] [ 38 ] [ 40 ] At ambient conditions, americium is present in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry , and a space group P6 3 /mmc with lattice parameters a = 346.8 pm and c = 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell . The crystal consists of a double- hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. [ 36 ] [ 40 ] The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic ( fcc ) symmetry, space group Fm 3 m and lattice constant a = 489pm. This fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. [ 36 ] [ 40 ] Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. [ 39 ] There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium . [ 41 ] As with many other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties, such as electrical resistivity . [ 42 ] So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium , but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium. [ 1 ] Americium is paramagnetic in a wide temperature range, from that of liquid helium , to room temperature, and above. This behavior is markedly different from that of its neighbor curium which exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. [ 43 ] The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2) × 10 −6 /°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4) × 10 −6 /°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. [ 40 ] The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (Δ f H °) of aqueous Am 3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol −1 . The standard potential Am 3+ /Am 0 is 2.08 ± 0.01V. [ 44 ] Chemical properties [ edit ] 3+ (left) and Am 4+ (right). Am 3+ is colorless at low and reddish at higher concentrations. Americium readily reacts with oxygen and dissolves well in acids . The most common oxidation state for americium is +3, [ 45 ] in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride , oxalate , iodate , hydroxide , phosphate and other salts. [ 45 ] Other oxidation states have been observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am 3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am 4+ (yellow-reddish), Am V O + ; (yellow), Am VI O 2+ (brown) and Am VII O 5− (dark green). [ 46 ] [ 47 ] All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm. [ 51 ] Americium compounds with oxidation state +4 and higher are strong oxidizing agents, comparable in strength to the permanganate ion ( MnO − ) in acidic solutions. [ 52 ] Whereas the Am 4+ ions are unstable in solutions and readily convert to Am 3+ , the +4 oxidation state occurs well in solids, such as americium dioxide (AmO 2 ) and americium(IV) fluoride (AmF 4 ). All pentavalent and hexavalent americium compounds are complex salts such as KAmO 2 F 2 , Li 3 AmO 4 and Li 6 AmO 6 , Ba 3 AmO 6 , AmO 2 F 2 . These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) can be prepared from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, [ 53 ] with silver(I) oxide in perchloric acid , [ 51 ] or with ozone or sodium persulfate in sodium carbonate solutions. [ 50 ] The pentavalent oxidation state of americium was first observed in 1951. [ 54 ] It is present in aqueous solution in the form of AmO + ions (acidic) or AmO − ions (alkaline) which are however unstable and subject to several rapid disproportionation reactions: [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Chemical compounds [ edit ] Oxygen compounds [ edit ] Two americium oxides are known, with the oxidation states +3 (Am 2 O 3 ) and +4 (AmO 2 ). Americium(III) oxide is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205°C. [ 58 ] Americium(IV) oxide is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic ( fluorite ) crystal structure. [ 59 ] The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the chemical formula Am 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 ·7H 2 O. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240°C and starts decomposing into AmO 2 at 300°C, the decomposition completes at about 470°C. [ 45 ] The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25g/L. [ 60 ] Halides [ edit ] Halides of americium are known for the oxidation states +2, +3 and +4, [ 61 ] where the +3 is most stable, especially in solutions. [ 62 ] Oxidation state F Cl Br I +4 Americium(IV) fluoride 4 +3 Americium(III) fluoride 3 Americium(III) chloride 3 Americium(III) bromide 3 Americium(III) iodide 3 +2 Americium(II) chloride 2 Americium(II) bromide 2 Americium(II) iodide 2 Reduction of Am(III) compounds with sodium amalgam yields Am(II) salts – the black halides AmCl 2 , AmBr 2 and AmI 2 . They are very sensitive to oxygen and oxidize in water, releasing hydrogen and converting back to the Am(III) state. Specific lattice constants are: Orthorhombic AmCl 2 : a = 896.3 ± 0.8 pm, b = 757.3 ± 0.8 pm and c = 453.2 ± 0.6 pm Tetragonal AmBr 2 : a = 1159.2 ± 0.4 and c = 712.1 ± 0.3 pm. [ 63 ] They can also be prepared by reacting metallic americium with an appropriate mercury halide HgX 2 , where X = Cl, Br or I: [ 64 ] Americium(III) fluoride (AmF 3 ) is poorly soluble and precipitates upon reaction of Am 3+ and fluoride ions in weak acidic solutions: The tetravalent americium(IV) fluoride (AmF 4 ) is obtained by reacting solid americium(III) fluoride with molecular fluorine : [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Another known form of solid tetravalent americium chloride is KAmF 5 . [ 65 ] [ 67 ] Tetravalent americium has also been observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH) 4 was dissolved in 15- M NH 3 F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which is similar to that of AmF 4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles. [ 49 ] Most americium(III) halides form hexagonal crystals with slight variation of the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl 3 ) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P6 3 /m) and the melting point of 715°C. [ 61 ] The fluoride is isotypic to LaF 3 (space group P6 3 /mmc) and the iodide to BiI 3 (space group R 3 ). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr 3 -type structure and space group Cmcm. [ 62 ] Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl 3 ·6H 2 O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure. [ 68 ] Oxyhalides of americium in the form Am VI O 2 X 2 , Am V O 2 X, Am IV OX 2 and Am III OX can be obtained by reacting the corresponding americium halide with oxygen or Sb 2 O 3 , and AmOCl can also be produced by vapor phase hydrolysis : [ 64 ] Chalcogenides and pnictides [ edit ] The known chalcogenides of americium include the sulfide AmS 2 , [ 69 ] selenides AmSe 2 and Am 3 Se 4 , [ 69 ] [ 70 ] and tellurides Am 2 Te 3 and AmTe 2 . [ 71 ] The pnictides of americium ( 243 Am) of the AmX type are known for the elements phosphorus , arsenic , [ 72 ] antimony and bismuth . They crystallize in the rock-salt lattice. [ 70 ] Silicides and borides [ edit ] Americium monosilicide (AmSi) and "disilicide" (nominally AmSi x with: 1.87 x 2.0) were obtained by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with elementary silicon in vacuum at 1050°C (AmSi) and 1150−1200°C (AmSi x ). AmSi is a black solid isomorphic with LaSi, it has an orthorhombic crystal symmetry. AmSi x has a bright silvery lustre and a tetragonal crystal lattice (space group I 4 1 /amd), it is isomorphic with PuSi 2 and ThSi 2 . [ 73 ] Borides of americium include AmB 4 and AmB 6 . The tetraboride can be obtained by heating an oxide or halide of americium with magnesium diboride in vacuum or inert atmosphere. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Organoamericium compounds [ edit ] 8 -C 8 H 8 ) 2 Am structure Analogous to uranocene , americium forms an organometallic compound with two cyclooctatetraene ligands, that is (η 8 -C 8 H 8 ) 2 Am. [ 76 ] It also makes trigonal (η 5 -C 5 H 5 ) 3 Am complexes with three cyclopentadienyl rings. [ 77 ] Formation of the complexes of the type Am(n-C 3 H 7 -BTP) 3 , where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C 3 H 7 -BTP and Am 3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS . Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with americium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. [ 78 ] Biological aspects [ edit ] Americium is an artificial element, and thus a biological function involving the element would be impossible. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. [ 81 ] Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria [ 82 ] [ 83 ] and fungi. [ 84 ] Fission [ edit ] The isotope 242m1 Am (half-life 141 years) has the largest cross sections for absorption of thermal neutrons (5,700 barns ), [ 85 ] that results in a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction . The critical mass for a bare 242m1 Am sphere is about 9–14kg (the uncertainty results from insufficient knowledge of its material properties). It can be lowered to 3–5kg with a metal reflector and should become even smaller with a water reflector. [ 86 ] Such small critical mass is favorable for portable nuclear weapons , but those based on 242m1 Am are not known yet, probably because of its scarcity and high price. The critical masses of two other readily available isotopes, 241 Am and 243 Am, are relatively high – 57.6 to 75.6kg for 241 Am and 209kg for 243 Am. [ 87 ] Scarcity and high price yet hinder application of americium as a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors . [ 88 ] There are proposals of very compact 10-kW high-flux reactors using as little as 20grams of 242m1 Am. Such low-power reactors would be relatively safe to use as neutron sources for radiation therapy in hospitals. [ 89 ] Isotopes [ edit ] See also: Isotopes of americium About 19 isotopes and 8 nuclear isomers are known for americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241 Am and 243 Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1 Am has a long half-life of 141years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64microseconds for 245m1 Am to 50.8hours for 240 Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons have relatively high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass. [ 12 ] Americium-241 decays to 237 Np emitting alpha particles of 5 different energies, mostly at 5.486MeV (85.2%) and 5.443MeV (12.8%). Because many of the resulting states are metastable, they also emit gamma rays with the discrete energies between 26.3 and 158.5keV. [ 90 ] Americium-242 is a short-lived isotope with a half-life of 16.02h. [ 12 ] It mostly (82.7%) converts by β-decay to 242 Cm, but also by electron capture to 242 Pu (17.3%). Both 242 Cm and 242 Pu transform via nearly the same decay chain through 238 Pu down to 234 U. Nearly all (99.541%) of 242m1 Am decays by internal conversion to 242 Am and the remaining 0.459% by α-decay to 238 Np. The latter breaks down to 238 Pu and then to 234 U. [ 12 ] Americium-243 transforms by α-emission into 239 Np, which converts by β-decay to 239 Pu, and the 239 Pu changes into 235 U by emitting an α-particle. Applications [ edit ] Outside and inside view of an americium-based smoke detector Ionization detectors [ edit ] Main article: Americium smoke detector Americium is the only synthetic element to have found its way into the household, where one common type of smoke detector uses 241 Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation . [ 91 ] This isotope is preferred over 226 Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful γ-radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq ) or 0.28 microgram . This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium -237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber , an air-filled space between two electrodes , and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Radionuclide [ edit ] As 241 Am has a significantly longer half-life than 238 Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), it has been proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators , for example in spacecraft. [ 96 ] Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241 Am and 6.31mW/g for 243 Am [ 1 ] (cf. 390mW/g for 238 Pu) [ 96 ] – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, the European Space Agency is planning to use americium for its space probes. [ 97 ] Another proposed space-related application of americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It relies on the very high rate of nuclear fission of 242m Am, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] The fission products of 242m Am can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator . [ 100 ] One more proposal which utilizes the high nuclear fission rate of 242m Am is a nuclear battery. Its design relies not on the energy of the emitted by americium alpha particles, but on their charge, that is the americium acts as the self-sustaining "cathode". A single 3.2kg 242m Am charge of such battery could provide about 140kW of power over a period of 80 days. [ 101 ] With all the potential benefits, the current applications of 242m Am are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer . [ 100 ] Neutron source [ edit ] The oxide of 241 Am pressed with beryllium is an efficient neutron source . Here americium acts as the alpha source, and beryllium produces neutrons owing to its large cross-section for the (α,n) nuclear reaction: The most widespread use of 241 AmBe neutron sources is a neutron probe – a device used to measure the quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. 241 Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in neutron radiography , tomography and other radiochemical investigations. [ 102 ] Production of other elements [ edit ] Americium is a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and transactinides – for example, 82.7% of 242 Am decays to 242 Cm and 17.3% to 242 Pu. In the nuclear reactor, 242 Am is also up-converted by neutron capture to 243 Am and 244 Am, which transforms by β-decay to 244 Cm: Irradiation of 241 Am by 12 C or 22 Ne ions yields the isotopes 247 Es ( einsteinium ) or 260 Db ( dubnium ), respectively. [ 102 ] Furthermore, the element berkelium ( 243 Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding 241 Am with alpha particles, in 1949, by the same Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research , Dubna , Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of 243 Am with 15 N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium , discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243 Am with 18 O. [ 7 ] Spectrometer [ edit ] Americium-241 has been used as a portable source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 60-keV gamma ray emissions from 241 Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers . For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to help create flat glass. [ 22 ] Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). [ 103 ] Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete. Health concerns [ edit ] As a highly radioactive element, americium and its compounds must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons which have a long penetration depth. [ 104 ] If consumed, americium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, roughly 45% of it goes to the liver and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over cortical and trabecular surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of 241 Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the gonads (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes formation of cancer cells as a result of its radioactivity. [ 17 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Americium often enters landfills from discarded smoke detectors . The rules associated with the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In the U.S., the "Radioactive Boy Scout" David Hahn was able to concentrate americium from smoke detectors after managing to buy a hundred of them at remainder prices and also stealing a few. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] There have been cases of humans being contaminated with americium, the worst case being that of Harold McCluskey , who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 as a result of an explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75, not as a result of exposure, but of a heart disease which he had before the accident.
