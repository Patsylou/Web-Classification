For elements that have no stable nuclides, the value enclosed in brackets indicates the mass number of the longest-lived isotope of the element. However three such elements ( thorium , protactinium and uranium ) do have a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, and for these an atomic weight is tabulated ( Atomic Weights of the Elements 2007 , Pure Appl. Chem. , Vol. 81 , No. 11, (2009) 2131-2156). Two new elements added to the Periodic Table! ONLINE CONTENTS Why is the periodic table shaped like it is? Organization of chemical elements in alphabetical order by their names (or symbols ) doesn't tell us anything about their properties but it is useful when searching for an element. We can list elements in order of increasing atomic number but it wouldn't be a periodic table any more. The periodic table is a chart that organizes the elements by increasing atomic number and their chemical and physical properties . Rows are arranged so that elements with similar properties fall into the same vertical columns ("groups"). Long form of the periodic table The lanthanides and actinides should actually be placed in the middle of the table as well, after lanthanum and actinium, but, because of their similarity to each other, they are removed from the middle to save space.

Xx Gases Xx Solids Xx Liquids Xx Synthetically prepared elements Our policy for Including New Elements on our periodic table Our policy is to only create individual element pages for elements on our periodic table that have been officially recognized and named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC). Likewise we only list unnamed elements on our table above whose discovery has been tentatively recognized by IUPAC. Thus at this point in time we have not created individual element pages for elements 114 and above as they have not been officially named. Likewise even though some scientists have claimed to have isolated elements 113 and 115 we do not list these two elements because their discovery has not yet been acknowledged by IUPAC. The "discovery" of element 118 is still very much in debate. It was reportedly isolated in 1999 by the Ninov et al. Berkeley collaboration, but that report was retracted in 2002. In Oct. 2006 it was again reportedly isolated by scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and their Russian partners at the Dubna nuclear research center in Russia, but IUPAC has not yet commented on this. IUPAC Announces Proposes Names for Elements 114 and 116 On December 1st 2011, the IUPAC announced the proposed names for elements 114 and 116 . Element 114 would be named flerovium with the symbol Fl, while element 116 would be named livermorium with the symbol Lv. There will be a five month comment period for the new names. If all goes well the names will become official in May of 2012.

F. Collier, p17. Henry Moseley, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 26, 1913, p1030. The Periodic Table Author: Dr. Doug Stewart The periodic table we use today is based on the one devised and published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev found he could arrange the 65 elements then known in a grid or table so that each element had: 1. A higher atomic weight than the one on its left. For example, magnesium (atomic weight 24.3) is placed to the right of sodium (atomic weight 23.0): 23.0 Na 24.3 Mg 9.01 Be 24.3 Mg 40.1 Ca 87.6 Sr Mendeleev realized that the table in front of him lay at the very heart of chemistry. And more than that, Mendeleev saw that his table was incomplete - there were spaces where elements should be, but no-one had discovered them.  Just as Adams and Le Verrier could be said to have discovered the planet Neptune on paper, Mendeleev could be said to have discovered germanium on paper. He called this new element eka-silicon , after observing a gap in the periodic table between silicon and tin: 28.1 Si ?? ?? 119 Sn Similarly, Mendeleev discovered gallium ( eka -aluminum) and scandium ( eka -boron) on paper, because he predicted their existence and their properties before their actual discoveries.

The standard form of the table includes periods (usually horizontal in the periodic table) and groups (usually vertical). Elements in groups have some similar properties to each other. There is no one single or best structure for the periodic table but by whatever consensus there is, the form used here is very useful. The periodic table is a masterpiece of organised chemical information. The evolution of chemistry's periodic table into the current form is an astonishing achievement with major contributions from many famous chemists and other eminent scientists. Latest news On 10 September 2013 a paper published in Phys. Rev. Lett by D. Rudolph and others outlines additional evidence for the claims that fusion-evaporation reactions between 48 Ca and 243 Am ions lead to the 288 Uup ( 288 115) and 287 Uup ( 287 115). A total of thirty correlated -decay chains were observed following the reactions. On 12 August 2013 experiments involving zinc ions travelling at 10% of the speed of light colliding with a thin bismuth layer apparently produced a very heavy ion followed by a chain of six consecutive alpha decays identified as products of an isotope of element 113 278 Uut - see new evidence for elements 113 . Confirmation of the discoveries of and name proposals for elements 114 (flerovium) and 116 (livermorium) A news reports from IUPAC ( more about flerovium and livermorium ) indicates the confirmation of the discoveries of elements 114 and 116: Discovery of the Elements with Atomic Number 114 and 116 . Proposals by the discoverers for the names of the two elements have now announced as: element 114: Flerovium (Fl) after the physicist Georgiy Flerov. Georgiy N. Flerov (1913-1990) was a renowned physicist who discovered the spontaneous fission of uranium and was a pioneer in heavy-ion physics. element 116: Livermorium (Lv), after the Livermore laboratories. A group of researchers from the Laboratory, along with scientists at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, participated in the work carried out in Dubna on the synthesis of superheavy elements, including element 116.

A paper just published (5 April 2010) in Physical Review Letters by Yu. Ts. Oganessian and others claims the synthesis of a new element with atomic number 117. The abstract states "The discovery of a new chemical element with atomic number Z=117 is reported. The isotopes 293 117 and 294 117 were produced in fusion reactions between 48 Ca and 249 Bk. Decay chains involving eleven new nuclei were identified by means of the Dubna Gas Filled Recoil Separator. The measured decay properties show a strong rise of stability for heavier isotopes with Z=111, validating the concept of the long sought island of enhanced stability for super-heavy nuclei."
