Table of Contents Site map Water Structure and Science Liquid water is not a bit player in the theatre of life its the headline act Water science Water (H 2 O) is often perceived to be ordinary as it is transparent, odorless, tasteless and ubiquitous. It is the simplest compound of the two most common reactive elements, consisting of just two hydrogen atoms attached to a single oxygen atom. Indeed, very few molecules are smaller or lighter. Liquid water, however, is the most extraordinary substance. Although we drink it, wash, fish and swim in it, and cook with it (although probably not all at the same time), we nearly always overlook the special relationship it has with our lives. Droughts cause famines and floods cause death and disease. It makes up over about half of us and, without it, we die within a few days. Liquid water has importance as a solvent, a solute, a reactant and a biomolecule, structuring proteins, nucleic acids and cells and controlling our consciousness. H 2 O is the second most common molecule in the Universe (behind hydrogen, H 2 ), the most abundant solid material and fundamental to star formation. There is a hundred times as many water molecules in our bodies as the sum of all the other molecules put together. Life cannot evolve or continue without liquid water, which is why there is so much excitement about finding it on Mars and other planets and moons. It is unsurprising that water plays a central role in many of the World's religions. This web site discusses many aspects of water science with the exception of availability, agricultural and environmental issues. Water properties Water is the most studied material on Earth but it is remarkable to find that the science behind its behavior and function are so poorly understood (or even ignored), not only by people in general, but also by scientists working with it every day. It can be extremely slippery and extremely sticky at the same time. The small size of its molecule belies the complexity of its actions and its singular capabilities. Liquid water's unique properties and chameleonic nature seem to fit ideally into the requirements for life as can no other molecule. A number of explanations of the complex behavior of liquid water have been published, many quite recently, with several stirring up great controversy. In this web site, I have attempted to present these ideas in a self-consistent and balanced manner, which I hope will encourage both its understanding and further work.

The most common methods are listed below. Inherent to the most precise of these techniques is to measure the weight of the meniscus. Accordingly, it is really the quality of the balance which determines the quality of the measured data. This is also why Kibron outperforms all competing tensiometers, with no exceptions. Yet, this is only one the secrets behind Kibron's unparalleled performance: our products have revolutionized the measurement of surface tension also because of utilizing the most precise measurement technique. Maximum pull on a rod (Du Noüy-Padday) - the method of choice This high precision variant of the Du Noüy method was developed by Padday et al. (J Chem Soc Far Trans I 71: 1919-1931, 1974). The technique is very simple: a thin rod (instead of a ring or a plate) is immersed into the sample and then pulled out and the maximum force is measured. The diameter of the probe is irrelevant and only if the diameter changes there is a need to recalibrate. This is automated and fast in all Kibron instruments. When calibration is done using a liquid with a known surface tension there is no need for correction. The weight of the meniscus depends only on surface tension, rod diameter, and the density of the liquid (see the above article by Padday et al.). After years of experience we can confirm that this is without doubt the absolutely most accurate method for recording surface tension, used in Kibron's high precision tensiometers. Good demonstration of the accuracy of the Kibron technology is when measuring small changes in surface tension (see pdf for test of the sensitivity of our portable, low cost tensiometer, AquaPi). Notably, the low cost AquaPi actually beats the performance of the top of the line, expensive tensiometers of our competitors! Last but not least, unlike the ring and Wilhelmy plate, the rod method also works for highly viscous liquids: oils, polymers, paints and the like, as used in Kibron's most advanced new tensiometer, EZ-PI Plus. See how it works: AquaPi in action Rod vs ring? Importantly, the geometry of the precision manufactured DyneProbes developed by Kibron makes correction for buoyancy unnecessary, unlike when using the ring method. This is simply due to the fact that at the point of maximal pull no part of the probe is immersed into the liquid. The unmatched sensitivity, excellent resolution (better than 0.2 micrograms), and the very low noise of Kibron's microbalance allow to use very small diameter rods, with pure water giving a meniscus of only 11.8 mg. Notably, some of our competitors offer platinum rods for 'small sample volume measurements' and show data measured with their rods and tensiometers, revealing large scatter. However, the poor quality of their data merely reveals the noise of their balance and the poor quality of their Pt-rods, further reflecting the overall poor quality of their manufacturing. It is also stated by companies making ring tensiometers that it is the Du Noüy-ring which should be used as a reference. This does not make any sense. After all, as expected the ring and rod do yield the same surface tension values (see comparison here ). Ring was simply used by Du Noüy because of the insensitivity of the balances available to him. In essence, the only difference between the Padday et al. and Du Noüy methods is the probe geometry. High sensitivity balance does not require large meniscus and allows to use a miniature rod. To summarize, compared to ring the rod has the following advantages: small sample volumes (minimally 50 microliters) can be measured. no need for buoyancy correction (for ring this is mandatory). also highly viscous samples (oils, paints, polymers etc.) are accurately measured by AutoPi. no problems with bending etc. damage. This is well known to ring users and also the reason why companies are selling devices to correct for ring geometry. However, those familiar with the technique also know that repairing a damaged ring is very difficult. Platinum is soft and it is very easy to distort the ring geometry to make it useless. the rod can be cleaned also automatically, as in Kibron Delta-8 and AutoPi, with no need for a Bunsen torch. rod allows surface tension to be measured very fast (approx. 20 seconds), as demonstrated for AquaPi. Multiple channels can be used: 8 microbalances in Delta-8, two in AutoPi. Delta-8 further uses the standard 96-well plate footprint disposable cuvettes.  Importantly, the rod can also be used for continuous monitoring of surface pressure, such as recording of compression isotherms. In this case maximum pull force is not recorded, but the rod touching the surface is used as a miniature Wilhelmy probe. Again, because of the inherent high sensitivity of Kibron balance long perimeter for wetting is not necessary, allowing sample volumes as small as 45 microliters to be measured. None of the instruments sold by our competitors come even close! Further, one measurement takes only approx. 20 seconds and in Kibron's Delta-8, with 8 microbalances, 96 surface tension measurements are done in less than three minutes. Wilhelmy plate A thin plate (perimeter about 40 mm) is lowered to the surface of a liquid and the downward force to the plate is measured. Surface tension is the force divided by the perimeter of the plate. The long perimeter is used so as to compensate for the insensitivity of the balance. For example, for a Wilhelmy plate with a wetted length of 40 mm the meniscus of water weighs 492 milligrams. The plate must be completely wetted before the measurement to ensure that the contact angle between the plate and the liquid is zero. If this is not true the Wilhelmy method is not valid. For reproducible results the position of the plate must be maintained constant, meaning that the lower end of the plate is exactly on the same level than the surface of the liquid. Nevertheless, for accurate results the values measured should be corrected for buoyancy. Word of warning: using filter paper as a Wilhelmy plate Occasionally one still sees a filter paper used instead of a Pt-plate, particularly in the low cost Langmuir-troughs and tensiometers. The benefit of the filter paper is that wetting is very efficient. However, the downside is a significant loss of material and the well known "chromatography effect". The easiest way to see this is to include a small amount of a fluorescent tracer (such as a fluorescent lipid) into the monolayer and record the surface pressure. First, you will see that the time needed to reach equilibrium is long because of adsorption of material to the filter paper. Second, if you inspect the filter paper fluorescence upon UV-illumination, you will see a significant amount of the fluorescent tracer accumulated at the top of the filter paper. This is essentially chromatography on the filter paper of your lipids and other film materials. We NEVER recommend using filter paper. Du Noüy ring A ring (standard perimeter about 60 mm) is pulled through the liquid/air interface and the maximum downward force to the ring is measured. This method is not direct. One must use correction factors which take account the dimensions of the ring (the perimeter, ring wire thickness and the effect of the opposite inner sides of the ring to the measurement), as well as correction for buoyancy. Another factor making this technique prone for errors is that the ring geometry must not be distorted or dented. This is the reason why companies sell ring repair tools. Yet, this repair seldom works and to be on the on the safe side it is best to purchase a new Pt-ring. Unfortunately, these are rather expensive. Pendant drop The liquid is injected from a needle so that it forms a drop on the tip of the needle. The drop is then optically observed and the surface tension is calculated from the shape of the drop. For tensiometers, which use this method, a computer controlled instrument and a sophisticated software is mandatory. Spinning drop This method is used when the surface tension values are so low that tensiometers, utilizing the above methods are not able to reach the measurement range. A small drop of a sample is injected inside a thin tube with another liquid. The tube is then rotated at a high speed and the interfacial surface tension is calculated from the angular speed of the tube and the shape of the drop.   Bubble pressure In this method a capillary tube is first immersed in the liquid sample. subsequently constant flow of gas is purged through the tube forming small bubbles into the liquid. The pressure needed to form a bubble is measured and the surface tension of the sample is calculated from the pressure difference between inside and outside the bubble and the radius of the bubble. This kind of tensiometers are used in many "on-line" measurements. However, the range of surface tensions accessible to this method is limited and cleaning of the system is difficult, resulting in deviation. © Kibron Inc. | Malminkaari 23 A, FIN-00700 Helsinki| tel: +358-10-2811670 | email:  |

Farlin et al. measured the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor in San Diego, California, at hourly intervals during February 2011 using a ground-based sensor. The time period included severe rainstorms and Santa Ana winds. They also used a general circulation model that included simulation of isotope variability to investigate how atmospheric and hydrologic processes affect isotope composition of water vapor near the surface.

The changing ratios of calcium and barium in the teeth of modern humans and macaques chronicle the transition from mother’s milk to solid food — and may provide clues about the weaning habits of Neanderthals, a new study suggests. The predominant mineral in the tooth enamel of primates is hydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. But trace elements present in the bloodstream that are chemically similar to calcium, such as strontium and barium, can be incorporated into enamel as it calcifies, says Manish Arora, an environmental chemist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Teeth begin forming in the gums before birth, and they record daily growth lines throughout their development, so they are good archives of diet and chemical exposure — even in infants.

Five elements at the heart of the periodic table will never look the same again, following an update to their atomic weights. Your chemistry teacher probably said to you atomic weights are constants of nature, but nothing could be further from the truth, says Tyler Coplen, director of the Reston Stable Isotope laboratory in Virginia. In fact, the atomic weight of some elements varies depending on where you are on Earth. Read more at NewScientist.com .

However, this approach requires knowledge on how dietary isotopic values are reflected in consumers tissues. To date, this information has only been obtained for a handful of ectotherms; in particular, little is known about crocodilians. In this study, diet-tissue discrimination factors (DTDFs) and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope turnover rates were estimated for plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), and muscle obtained from broad-snouted caimans ( Caiman latirostris ).

Posted on May 20, 2013 by Camille 5/20/2013 One way to know how much soda people drink is to ask them. The problem? We tend to underestimate, lie or forget what weve consumed. And this is a challenge for researchers who study the links between sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity. A new study published in the Journal of Nutrition explains a technique that could help researchers get a good measurement of sugary beverage consumption — by analyzing a piece of hair or a blood sample.

This photo was taken along the Beaufort Sea coastline of Alaska. (Photo by Susanne Miller, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) High school chemistry class was probably the last time you heard anyone mention the periodic table of elements, which lists 118 building blocks for everything in nature. Nitrogen is one of those elements. If you are Matt Rogers, manager of the stable isotope lab at UAA, nitrogen is a key to unlock natures back stories. Take a tiny piece of animal tissue or a few plant leaves, some water or dirt, and with the help of high-end technology, he can use nitrogen to decipher the ecological story behind any of them. Was that polar bear eating ringed seal or bowhead whale leftovers? How much of a wolfs diet was caribou and how much was salmon? Exactly what nutrients were available in the soil where that shrub grew? Read more at Anchorage Daily News .

In research published today in the prestigious international journal PLOS ONE, the team are able to identify what is likely to be the first group of people to colonise Marlborough’s Wairau Bar possibly from Polynesia around 700 years ago. They also present evidence suggesting that individuals from two other groups buried at the site had likely lived in different regions of New Zealand before being buried at Wairau Bar. The researchers, co-ordinated by the Department of Anatomy’s Associate Professor Hallie Buckley, undertook isotopic analyses of samples recovered from the koiwi tangata (human remains) of the Rangitane iwi tupuna prior to their reburial at Wairau Bar in 2009.

The water is rich in hydrogen and methane, which nourish microbes living today near hydrothermal vents on the seafloor. That means the deposits may harbor ancient lineages of life cut off from the surface for eons, the researchers report in the May 16 Nature .

Their conclusion: The Moons water did not come from comets but was already present on Earth 4.5 billion years ago, when a giant collision sent material from Earth to form the Moon. Water inside the Moons mantle came from primitive meteorites, new research finds, the same source thought to have supplied most of the water on Earth. The findings raise new questions about the process that formed the Moon. Read more at ScienceDaily.com .
