Kittle, aka " Foamman " Introduction THE FOAM BOOK is a mechanism for concentrating the information resources relating to some aqueous based foam systems, their technological applications, published papers, documents, and patents, as well as identifying the major participants involved with the technology developments. THE FOAM BOOK utilizes as many hyperlinks to other resources as possible, involving email addresses, web pages, and secondary sources where information can be obtained libraries, reference sources, trade associations, laboratories, etc. Technical papers and patents are directly available on this web site, mostly in searchable PDF* format. Foamman is only providing information gathered through normal activities, and makes no suggestion that these web pages represent a comprehensive literature search. However, the information provided will allow an interested person to start the information flow, hopefully leading to the answers desired. The selection of topics is arbitrary with no intent to malign those who work in the aqueous foam application areas, but are omitted here (e.g., cosmetics, personal care products, and conventional cleaning systems). Some editorial comments have been added. The information provided is entirely "public domain," thereby, obviously, does not include some of the technology being practiced and being developed commercially.

 Welcome to the Soil Water Biogeochemistry Laboratory (SWBL) Department of Agronomy Principal Investigator Dr. Elisa Marie D'Angelo Contents Research Current Projects Join the Team Facilities Teaching Biographical Information of Elisa D'Angelo (Principal Investigator) Key Personnel Refereed Publications Related Links Contact Information Information about the Commonwealth of Kentucky (Photograph of a typical bottomland hardwood forest wetland that dominated much of KY prior to the 1800's. At the state and federal levels, there is interest in preserving and recreating these systems to recover lost wetland functions, such as water quality improvement, habitat, and recreation. The SWBL at UK is investigating how well the replacement, or mitigated wetlands, are performing biogeochemical C, N, and P cycling processes compared to "pristine" bottomland hardwood forest wetlands. This information is necessary to properly identify suitable sites, and monitor, and manage mitigated wetlands so that the "No Net Loss" wetland goal can be achieved. Exciting new results!!! ) Research Aerobic and anaerobic microbial ecology and diversity in the soil-water-rhizosphere environment Microbial transformations of organic and inorganic pollutants Regulators of microbial processes Bioavailability of pollutants and environmental fate Biogeochemical processes affecting water quality in lakes and constructed/natural wetlands Soil bioremediation Research Justification internet casino slots Expanding agricultural and industrial production have significantly improved the socioeconomic status of many Kentuckians. Associated with some of these activities, however, are impeded soil and water quality that impact the health and quality of life for many citizens and the environment. The essence of Biogeochemistry is to gain an understanding of biological and chemical processes that govern the fate of contaminants in the environment, and to use this knowledge to develop solutions to environmental problems. A critical issue facing Kentuckians is how to remediate soils and sediments contaminated with agricultural and industrial toxic organic compounds. For example, pollution of soils and sediments with toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from improper industrial waste disposal has resulted in several recent fish consumption advisories in Kentucky and surrounding states. On a statewide and national basis, PCBs are one of twenty top hazardous substances , and we still do not know the extent of contamination largely because of high sampling and analytical costs. In collaboration with the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky, we are developing biosensors using genetically engineered microorganisms that sensitively detect low levels of PCBs and their degradation intermediates in soil and water samples ( Abstract ). With this technology, we can rapidly survey large numbers of samples and notify the public of potential health risks. Once toxic contaminants are detected, we can take steps to remediate these systems. For example, we now know that if natural microbial populations are provided appropriate growing conditions, they will detoxify the pollutants by degrading them or binding them with soil organic matter. Once relationships between environmental conditions and detoxification processes are understood, it will be possible to manipulate them to enhance removal of toxic chemicals in these environments. Another concern facing Kentuckians is the widespread contamination of rivers, streams, and lakes with phosphorus and bacteria originating from domestic waste and surface runoff from manure applied land. These pollutants cause surface waters to be unfit for drinking, swimming, boating and fishing, thereby reducing the quality of life for Kentuckians as well as for visitors to the Commonwealth ( 1998 Water Quality Report to Congress ). Fortunately, some soils and other solid materials have high capacities to sorb these pollutants, thereby reducing chances of pollution to sensitive water bodies. We are taking advantage of this process by evaluating the trapping efficiency of several soils and other sorbents, and choosing the most suitable ones to construct combined grass filter strip-sorbent systems to trap pollutants in the landscape. Flirting Body Language : Tips to Perfect Flirting | Accounting outsourcing can shed your workload | Advanced Blackjack Strategy About 90% of Kentucky's wetlands have been lost since settlement in the 1700's. With these losses, we have lost several important wetland functions including wildlife habitat, water purification, and flood control. In accordance with the goal of "No Net Loss" of wetlands by the US administration, we are assigned the task of saving remaining wetlands and constructing replacement wetlands that fulfill these functions. In Kentucky, new wetland impacts are required to be mitigated at a minimum ratio of two acres restored for each one acre lost. One question facing Kentuckians is, "How do we know whether constructed/restored wetlands are adequately performing the functions of original, undisturbed wetlands?" We are in the process of evaluating water purification processes and microbial diversity in disturbed and undisturbed wetlands to determine whether easily measurable indicators can be used to assess the success of wetland restoration. free internet casino games My research focuses on the biological and chemical fate pathways of toxic organic chemicals (chlorinated aromatic compounds) and other contaminants (phosphorus) in soils, water and wetlands. Several projects are in progress that address these issues: development of genetically-engineered microbial detection systems for chlorinated aromatics in soils and water, evaluate the microbial ecology and degradation/humification of chlorinated aromatics in wetland and upland soils, determine the capacity of Kentucky soils and other sorbents to sequester animal manure-derived phosphorus and bacteria in the landscape, and evaluate the use of biogeochemical indicators as tools to assess the health of natural and constructed/restored wetlands. Back to top Current Projects (2000-2005; listed in order of funding date) 1. Biosensor detection of chlorinated pesticides in soils and water (Funding NIH; Investigators Daunert, D'Angelo, Guan, Xu, and Ghosh) This project is a collaborative effort between researchers in the Departments of Chemistry, Agronomy, and Biochemistry. We are developing new sensing systems for a toxic group of substances known as polychlorinated biphenyls and their breakdown products in environmental samples, including water, soils, and biological tissues. Methods consist of developing efficient PCB extraction procedures from different matrices and detection using genetically engineered biosensing systems ( Abstract ). 2. Enhanced mineralization of chlorinated pesticides at aerobic-anaerobic, plant-soil-water interfaces (Funding RCG; Investigators D'Angelo and Meade) Highly chlorinated organic compounds are only partially degraded under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions, generating several toxic by products. This project investigates whether sequential anaerobic and aerobic microbial processes in the plant rhizosphere and soil-water interface will enhance the degradation of chlorinated organic chemicals in flooded soils. Results will be valuable for the design of treatment systems for soils contaminated with this class of compounds. 3. Microbial population dynamics during PCB bioremediation in soils (Funding NSF-Career Grant; Investigator D'Angelo and Wensui) Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most common and toxic substances at Superfund sites, and contamination has resulted in several fish consumption advisories in Kentucky rivers and streams. This study investigates ways to promote biodegradation and binding-attachment of PCBs to soil organic matter through stimulation of key microbial communities, so that contaminants no longer pose a threat to humans or the environment. 4. Linkages between microbial diversity and processes along nutrient gradients in wetlands (Funding NSF; Investigators: Ogram, Reddy, D'Angelo) free internet casino Over 50% of US wetlands have been lost or impacted by urban and agricultural activities, hence there is interest in protecting and restoring these ecosystems. This study investigates whether genomic diversity and metabolic processes of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are sensitive bioindicators of ecosystem impact and recovery. 5. In situ testing of integrated grass filter strip-permeable reactive barrier systems for groundwater protection (Funding KWRRI; Investigators: D'Angelo, Vandiviere, and Coyne) We are testing the ability of different sorbents to sequester important domestic waste and agricultural contaminants phosphorus and bacteria from water. Suitable sorbents are to be installed in agronomic settings as part of integrated grass filter strip-permeable reactive barrier systems with the goal of preventing water pollution from runoff and leaching from fertilizer and manure-amended soils. 6. Phosphorus behavior in soils and potential impacts on water quality (Funding SB 271; Investigators: D'Angelo, Vandiviere, Thom, and Sikora) In this study, we are (1) developing sorption-desorption isotherms for P in a spectrum of Kentucky soils, (2) describing P sorption behavior using a variety of models (3) establishing relationships between easily measurable soil properties and sorption behavior, (4) validating these relationships on new sets of KY soils, and (5) elucidating the fate and distribution of P in fertilizer and manure-amended soils. Results of these studies will ultimately be used during the development of "Best Management Practices" and regulations for P in KY ( Research Brief and Abstract ). 7. Soil Biogeochemical Indicators to Assess Water Quality Improvement Function of Wetlands (Funding USDA-NRI; Investigators: D'Angelo, Karathanasis, Wehr, Ritchey, and Sparks) In this project, we are investigating nutrient cycling processes, biogeochemical indicators, and the HGM system in a series of laboratory and in situ studies with soil and litter obtained from low-gradient, riverine wetlands, with the goal of linking actual wetland processes to biogeochemical indicators and HGM variables. Results will ultimately be useful by providing diagnostic tools to assess the water quality improvement function of created and restored wetland ecosystems. The study will also generate data required for development of N and P nutrient quality standards for wetlands as required by EPA in the year 2003.

 Environmental chemistry From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia navigation ,       search Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. It should not be confused with green chemistry , which seeks to reduce potential pollution at its source. It can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air , soil , and water environments; and the effect of human activity and biological activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric , aquatic and soil chemistry , as well as heavily relying on analytical chemistry and being related to environmental and other areas of science. Environmental chemistry involves first understanding how the un contaminated environment works, which chemicals in what concentrations are present naturally, and with what effects. Without this it would be impossible to accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals . Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical species in the environment . Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations , solutions , units , sampling , and analytical techniques . [ 1 ] Contents 1 Contamination 2 Environmental indicators 3 Applications 4 Methods 5 Published analytical methods 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading 9 External links Contamination [ edit ] A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] This may be due to human activity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with pollutant , which is a substance that has a detrimental impact on the surrounding environment. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Whilst a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date. [ 6 ] The "medium" (e.g. soil) or organism (e.g. fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a receptor , whilst a sink is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant. Environmental indicators [ edit ] Main article: Freshwater environmental quality parameters Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen (DO) , chemical oxygen demand (COD) , biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) , total dissolved solids (TDS) , pH , nutrients ( nitrates and phosphorus ), heavy metals (including copper , zinc , cadmium , lead and mercury ), and pesticides . See also: Category:Water quality indicators Applications [ edit ] Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales ), the Environmental Protection Agency (in the United States ) the Association of Public Analysts , and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include: Heavy metal contamination of land by industry. These can then be transported into water bodies and be taken up by living organisms. Nutrients leaching from agricultural land into water courses, which can lead to algal blooms and eutrophication . [ 7 ] Urban runoff of pollutants washing off impervious surfaces ( roads , parking lots , and rooftops ) during rain storms. Typical pollutants include gasoline , motor oil and other hydrocarbon compounds, metals, nutrients and sediment (soil). [ 8 ] Organometallic compounds. [ 9 ] Methods [ edit ] Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies. [ 10 ] Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric , titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry : Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (ICP-AES) or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools. Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals . These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms. Published analytical methods [ edit ] Peer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and private research organizations. [ 13 ] Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.

 EnvironmentalChemistry.com Environmental , Chemistry Hazardous Materials News, Careers Resources Skip to page content Skip to site menu on this page We provide environmental, chemistry and hazardous materials news, information & resources including: in depth articles; a detailed periodic table of elements ; chemical substance database ; hazmat emergency response guides ; hazmat placarding information ; and much more. We are more than just a great reference resource; we strive to provide hard science articles written by highly qualified scientists like Wilma Pretorius, PhD . Articles and resources are divided into five major subject areas (environmental issues, chemistry resources, hazardous materials, "go green" and careers), which are further broken down into sub-topics. For instance our environmental section is sub-divided into the following sections: Climate Change, Consumer Health & Food Safety, Energy, Environmental Disasters, Politics and Public Policy, Pollution, Sustainability, Waste Recycling. Go Green Going green can save money while helping to protect the environment. 70s House Eco Renovation A series of articles documenting the eco renovation a house built in 1970 and reviewing products used in the renovation. We expect the renovations to be spread out over a few years. Redecorating Eradicating the color green: This phase of our eco renovation focused primarily on aesthetics, interior decoration, and critical safety issues. Painting Walls Bright walls require less light, Low VOC options, recycled painting supplies. Replacing Carpets Soybean based padding, recycled PET carpets, low VOCs, reduced health concerns Updating Light Fixtures Better ambiance, energy efficient CFLs Bathroom Renovation This make over may come in stages as we may replace the most wasteful fixtures before the full bathroom renovation takes place. Installing a low flow showerhead An easy DIY project that will result in immediate savings. Switching to Renewable Energy One of the ways we will reduce our carbon footprint will be to replace some of our fossil fuel energy consumption over to carbon neutral renewable energy sources. Buying local clean power electricity One of the easiest ways for us to reduce our carbon footprint by around 1.5 tons per year was to start buying our electricity from a clean power provider. Kitchen Renovation - Coming in 2010 or 2011 Weatherization - Coming late 2009 The most important part of reducing one's energy usage is weatherizing one's home. The first step in this is conducting an energy audit. Energy Audit This energy audit was conducted on our house to help us prioritize weatherization and energy efficiency projects. Revised ROI Calculations These are updated return on investment calculations for the energy audit that was conducted on our house and reflect updated information.

We aim to explore what we know, and what we dont know, about estuarine and coastal biogeochemistry, and evaluate our ability to predict estuarine processes at a time of great natural and man-induced environmental change. Holistic approaches to the biogeochemistry and modelling of estuarine and coastal processes will be addressed, including the controls imposed by physical processes and process-oriented research in biogeochemistry. The Symposium will encompass a wide spectrum of analytes in the estuarine and coastal setting, including metals, radionuclides, organic micropollutants, nutrients and organic carbon, as well as emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and nanoparticles. The Symposium will be of interest to estuarine and marine chemists, geochemists, biologists, ecologists, physicists and modellers, and regulators, policy makers and environmental consultants. You can stay updated through checking the Symposium website Posted on: 4 July 2012, 21:22 by: Comment EMEC13, furtherannouncement Dear colleagues!

Albert Lebedev Posted on: 22 June 2012, 19:07 by: Comment Nutrient AnalysisWorkshop Plymouth University, 26-28th June 2012 This hands-on workshop will focus on methods for the determination of the macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Attendees will have the opportunity to learn about, and discuss, quality issues pertaining to N and P analysis in water samples before embarking on a series of practical sessions. There will be an opportunity to get hand-on experience with techniques for the determination of N and P species in water samples: namely spectrophotometry using a segmented flow analyser (nitrate and phosphate), fluorimetry (ammonium), high temperature catalytic combustion (organic nitrogen). In addition, the application of flow injection techniques will be introduced to present attendees with ideas for building their own system for nutrient determinations. The course will include lectures on analytical quality control and the cycling of N and P in aquatic systems and there will be ample opportunity for discussion, data analysis and interpretation, and networking. The fee for this 3-day course will be £450, which includes pre-course materials, daily refreshments and lunch, and a workshop dinner on the 27th June.

In the lead off column: Plastics in the Marine Environment From Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management Dempster-Shafer theory applied to regulatory decision-making for safer alternatives to toxic chemicals in consumer products With uncertainty often influencing decisions to regulate chemicals in consumer products, what are regulatory agencies to do? Park et al. presents an integrative approach for dealing with this dilemma. The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory allows the analyst to combine multiple pieces of evidence and judgments from independent sources of information with its integrative risk analytic framework. Through the application of D-S theory to toxicity risk assessment, Park et al. show how multiplesometimes conflicting lines of evidence can be converted into a unified risk estimate and effectively used for comparative assessments to select potentially less toxic, alternative chemicals.

Published online 11 December 2013 The development of electrochemical methods for determining nanoparticles in the environment. Part II. Chronoamperometric study of FeS in sodium chloride solutions Environmental context.  In anoxic environments FeS is both an important mediator in the Fe and S biogeochemical cycles and plays a vital role in controlling the scavenging and availability of many trace metals. Electrochemical detection of colloidal and particulate FeS in natural waters can be done by voltammetric measurements. The recorded anodic waves, however, are rather qualitative and lack information on the FeS concentration and size distribution. Abstract Published online 09 December 2013 The development of electrochemical methods for determining nanoparticles in the environment. Part I. Voltammetry and in-situ electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscopy (EC-STM) study of FeS in sodium chloride solutions Environmental context.  The dramatic change in physical and chemical characteristics that substances experience at reduced length scales (1–100 nm), together with a potential risk of ecotoxicity, are two of the reasons for the scientific interest in nanoparticles. The current understanding of the behaviour and fate of nanoparticles in natural waters is limited because of a lack of efficient methods for their characterisation. Electrochemistry is a promising tool for the determination and characterisation of nanoparticles in the natural environment. Abstract Published online 26 September 2013 Voltammetric characterisation of macroalgae-exuded organic ligands (L) in response to Cu and Zn: a source and stimuli for L Environmental context.  Identifying the source and stimuli responsible for organic ligands in seawater is crucial to understanding trace metal availability. Voltammetric techniques were employed to characterise the water chemistry of seaweed cultures exposed to low levels of Cu or Zn over 7 days. The results suggest that seaweeds are a potential source of metal complexing ligands and Cu and Zn appear to stimulate ligand production; further research is required to determine if this is applicable to macroalgae and metals outside this study. Abstract Supplementary Material (98 KB) Published online 20 September 2013 Deposition and dissolution of metal sulfide layers at the Hg electrode surface in seawater electrolyte conditions Environmental context.  The electrochemical detection of many sulfur compounds in natural waters is based on the deposition of a HgS layer at the Hg electrode. In samples containing metal ions in excess of sulfide species, electrochemical exchange reactions between the HgS and the metal ion produce metal-sulfide voltammetric peaks. These peaks can easily be misinterpreted as dissolved sulfide species, and hence do not reflect the bulk state of the solution. Abstract Environmental Chemistry Subscriber Login Hard X-ray synchrotron biogeochemistry: piecing together the increasingly detailed puzzle pp. 1-3 Scaling up: fulfilling the promise of X-ray microprobe for biogeochemical research pp. 4-9 Environmental context.  Although biogeochemical processes in the environment are often considered on large spatial scales, critical processes can occur at fine-spatial scales. Quantifying these processes is a challenge, but significant recent developments in microprobe X-ray absorption spectroscopy in terms of data collection and analysis greatly facilitate micro-scale observations at the sample-level. These mapping methods create datasets that can be integrated with bulk observations with the potential for widespread application to biogeochemical research. Abstract Visualising Fe speciation diversity in ocean particulate samples by micro X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy pp. 10-17 Environmental context.  Iron-bearing particles in the ocean have attracted interest due to the role of iron as an essential nutrient for microscopic algae, which form the base of the marine food chain. Modern techniques make it possible to analyse individual particles of iron to determine their composition, but the resulting flood of data can be overwhelming. We show a method of simplifying the data to answer such questions as what groups of minerals are present and whether they are different between ocean basins. Abstract | Full Text PDF (779 KB) Supplementary Material (4 MB) Effect of biogeochemical redox processes on the fate and transport of As and U at an abandoned uranium mine site: an X-ray absorption spectroscopy study pp. 18-27 Environmental context.  Uranium and arsenic, two elements of human health concern, are commonly found at sites of uranium mining, but little is known about processes influencing their environmental behaviour. Here we focus on understanding the chemical and physical processes controlling uranium and arsenic transport at an abandoned uranium mine. We find that the use of sedimentation ponds limits the mobility of uranium; however, pond conditions at our site resulted in arsenic mobilisation. Our findings will help optimise restoration strategies for mine tailings. Abstract Supplementary Material (788 KB) Synchrotron X-ray distinction of seasonal hydrological and temperature patterns in speleothem carbonate pp. 28-36 Environmental context.  Speleothem chemical records are used to reconstruct environmental change on a broad range of timescales. However, one of the biggest challenges is to link the records contained within speleothems at the sub-annual timescale to changing meteorological conditions. Seasonal infiltration patterns and cave ventilation dynamics are reconstructed through high resolution analysis of speleothem trace element content by synchrotron radiation, building towards proxy records of hydrological variability and winter duration as indices of recent climatic change beyond the instrumental period. Abstract Supplementary Material (239 KB) Environmental chemistry: a discipline standing on two shoulders pp. 37-40 Diffusion limitation of zinc fluxes into wheat roots, PLM and DGT devices in the presence of organic ligands pp. 41-50 Environmental context.  Zinc is an essential micronutrient for plants and many arid areas of the world have zinc-deficient soils. The bioavailability of Zn to plants is influenced by diffusion limitations and complex lability in the soil solution. To identify the relative importance of these two factors, we investigated the influence of diffusion layer thickness on Zn uptake by wheat and by two bio-mimetic devices in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and two natural ligands found in soil. Abstract Supplementary Material (469 KB) Photolysis and TiO 2 -catalysed degradation of diclofenac in surface and drinking water using circulating batch photoreactors pp. 51-62 Environmental context.  Diclofenac, a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is not completely removed from surface and drinking water by conventional treatment methods. Consequently, this drug is present in the aquatic environment and has been subsequently linked to toxic effects on organisms. We show that photolysis and TiO 2 -catalysed degradation in circulating batch reactors efficiently results in diclofenac removal under a variety of conditions. These photochemical methods thus may lead to more effective water treatment processes. Abstract 2 A method to determine silver partitioning and lability in soils pp. 63-71 Environmental context.  Soils contaminated with silver can have detrimental environmental effects because of silver’s toxicity to a range of soil-dwelling organisms. The total concentration of silver in soil, however, is often not a good indicator of potential toxicity as it does not account for variations in bioavailability. We report a method for soil analysis that measures the amount of silver available for uptake by soil-dwelling organisms, and hence could provide data that better reflect potential toxicity. Abstract Supplementary Material (221 KB) Solid phase microextraction speciation analysis of triclosan in aqueous media containing sorbing nanoparticles pp. 72-76 Environmental context.  Speciation analysis of organic compounds in aquatic media is often performed using solid phase microextraction with the assumption that only the free organic form is accumulated. We show that in the presence of silica nanoparticles, this interpretation is confounded by partitioning of nanoparticulate-bound compounds between water and the solid phase, as well as their aggregation at solid–bulk medium interfaces. Equilibrium measurement of the target analyte is feasible if the solid phase is protected by a suitable membrane. Abstract Australian carbon tetrachloride emissions in a global context pp. 77-88 Environmental context.  Carbon tetrachloride in the background atmosphere is a significant environmental concern, responsible for ~10 % of observed stratospheric ozone depletion. Atmospheric concentrations of CCl 4 are higher than expected from currently identified emission sources: largely residual emissions from production, transport and use. Additional sources are required to balance the expected atmospheric destruction of CCl 4 and may contribute to a slower-than-expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone ‘hole’.
