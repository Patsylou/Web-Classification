The programme is also suitable for those who are considering a future in freelance web design. Applicants should have an interest in design and a working familiarity with the software employed in a modern office environment. There are many web design courses in London but we are the only institution currently offering a post-graduate MA in this fast-evolving subject. See Programme details for more information. Learning web design The design of excellent websites presents a notable intellectual challenge and, during the programme, students develop a modern, professional and approach. Our objective is to provide a balanced education in the three main aspects of web design and content management: technical, functional and aesthetic. In addition, students will learn how to manage and promote websites and how to generate revenue from them. See Our philosophy for more information. The technical aspects of the programme provide an understanding of the wide range of tools, technologies and principles used for the design and development of contemporary websites. This includes the creation of semantically correct markup, the separation of presentation from content ( HTML and CSS ) and compliance with web standards ( W3C ). The functional aspects focus on the creation of websites with good information architecture that are accessible, useable and findable as a result of effective search engine marketing and optimisation ( SEM / SEO ). Students learn how people use the web, how they navigate web content and how they search for information. The aesthetic aspects of web design are considered in relation to graphic, artistic, typographic and business objectives, including corporate identity and branding. The architectural principle that form should follow function is relevant, not as a rule but because aesthetic considerations must be judged with regard to the technical and functional aspects of a website. Student competence in these three aspects of web design is demonstrated by their delivery of a fully-functioning website for their Web Thesis Project at the end of the programme. See Core courses for more information. We believe our programme is unique in offering a balanced blend of the technical, functional and aesthetic aspects of web design and we are the only university in London offering such a focused programme at masters level. Flexible teaching mode The timetable is designed to make it easy for those in full-time employment to attend the programme and students have the option of a full-time (one day per week) or part-time (one half day per week) mode of study. Although contact time is relatively short, students should be aware that there will be a substantial amount of course work, project work and reading to be completed in their own time. See Preparing for study for more information. Students Typically, our students fall into three groups: those with web-related skills (often self-taught) who need a structured and balanced approach to further study; those who are involved with the web and need new skills to develop their present careers; those who have decided on a career change and see web design and content management as a new opportunity.
