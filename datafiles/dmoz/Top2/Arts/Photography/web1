Weisberg has prepared a series of comprehensive exhibitions, catalogues, books, and articles that have focused on a series of themes affecting French art from the middle of the nineteenth century until World War I. Many of these museum based exhibitions, and publications, have played a role in redefining issues and reconceptualizing the ways in which movements and artists in this era are now viewed or discussed. Dr. Weisberg's examination and study of many artists - includingJules Adler,Albert Besnard,ois Bonvin, Jules Breton, Jean-Charles Cazin, P.A.J. Dagnan-Bouveret, Jules-Alexis Muenier, Thodule Ribot, as well as Art Nouveau artists, and their sponsor Siegfried Bing - have helped reestablish an awareness and appreciation of these artists work. Two other areas of Art History Dr. Weisberg has studied are art criticism in his examination of the career of the art critic Philippe Burty, and Japonisme, areas that came out of his work on Burty and Bing. In combining this study with considerable field research Dr. Weisberg continues to be actively involved in the reappraisal and contextualization of many late nineteenth century art historical issues.
