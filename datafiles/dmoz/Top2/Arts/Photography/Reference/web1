Although the Gallery began actively acquiring photographs in 1989, the collection initially consisted primarily of the art of a few key twentieth-century American photographers: Alfred Stieglitz , Paul Strand , Ansel Adams , Walker Evans , Robert Frank , and Harry Callahan . Since 1995 the museum has been adding photographs from a much broader spectrum and now has more than 9,000 nineteenth- and twentieth-century photographs in the collection, by more than 250 European and American photographers. This tour, drawn entirely from the Gallery's collection and from promised gifts, celebrates some of those recent additions, including works by pioneer photographer William Henry Fox Talbot , celebrated nineteenth-century master Julia Margaret Cameron , modernist artists such as Charles Sheeler and L Moholy-Nagy , as well as such observers of modern life as Bill Brandt .

HOMEWORK PICTURES Teachers see: GreatRace  GameKids   LessonPlans RR BOOKS ONLINE Lewis Clement had achieved  a triumph of the first magnitude in engineering. The Summit  Tunnel was 7,042 feet above the sea. This  was the highest point reached by the CP. The facings were off by  only two inches , a feat that could hardly be equaled in the twenty-first  century. Clement had done it with black powder, nitroglycerin, and  muscle power. He had not used electric or steam-driven drills, steam  engines to power scoop shovels, or any gas or electric-powered carts or  cars to haul out the broken granite. There were no robots, no mechanical  devices. Well over 95 percent of the work was done by the Chinese  men. They and their foremen and the bosses, Clement and Crocker  and Strobridge, had created one of the greatest moments in American history.  More  than a dozen tunnels were blasted  through the granite mountains. Most were on curves, laid out by Lewis Clement . When the faces met, they were never more than an inch off line,  showing the remarkable accuracy of his calculations and instrument work  under the most difficult of circumstances. Van Nostrands Engineering  Magazine said in 1870 that the undertaking was preposterous, but  Clement did it.  Stephen E. Ambrose, Nothing  Like It in the World The  Men Who Built The Transcontinental Railroad 1863 - 1869 The idea for a transcontinental railroad "to shrink the continent and change the whole world" was first proposed by men of imagination in 1830. It wasn't until 1862 that Congress passed a bill  authorizing such a venture. In 1869, after a long, bitter and often terrifying struggle against Indian attacks, brutal weather, floods, labor shortages, political chicanery, lawlessness and a war, the first transcontinental railroad finally became a reality. Now the way was open for vast expansion and social changes that would make America the industrial giant of the world. ... One of the great engineering feats of history and ... a fascinating chapter in the development of our country. [After Rails Across the Continent: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad by Enid Johnson.] Text Courtesy Walt Winter. An 1846 Cincinnati newspaper mocked the utopian claims that a railroad could create settlements, commerce and wealth the project's supporters, the paper suggested, might as well be promising to unite neighboring planets in our solar system and make them better acquainted with each other. [ Looking at the Transcontinental Railroad as the Internet of 1869by Edward Rothstein, NewYork Times ,December 11, 1999. ] Text Courtesy DavidBain . [ Interview ] Photography was a critical marketing tool for financing with transcontinental railroad bonds both the CPRR and UPRR hired photographers to document the progress of construction , producing the numerous stereoviews which now illustate this website. The camera equipment of the day was so large and heavy that a photo wagon was needed. Wet glass plate collodion negatives had to be produced in the field, required long exposures, and albumen paper required 20 minutes in sunlight to make photo prints. Today's digital cameras by comparison are a marvel to select the best camera to create photographs for the CPRR Museum website, we found invaluable the extensive reviews on a great site for digital cameras, Digital Camera HQ . 2014 CPRR.org By visiting this site you agreeto the terms of the CPRR.org UserAgreement .

In 1864 the first Chinese workers were hired, and starting in March,1865 , thousandsofChineseinKwantungProvincewere recruited byCentralPacificRailroad Co. to work on the western portion of transcontinental railroad.The roadbed was blasted out of the solid rock mountainside in the fallof 1865 by lowering Chinese workers (alsoknown as "Celestials" after the "Celestial Kingdom" as these tireless workersreferred to their homeland) on ropes down the cliff face. These Chinese men drilled and packed blackpower charges in the rock, lit the fuses, and had the agility to scamperup the ropes before the explosions. CapeHorn, Sierra Nevada Mountains,California .  The Chinese made the roadbed and laid the track around Cape Horn.  Though  this took until the spring of 1866, it was not as time-consuming or difficult  as had been feared. Still it remains one of the best known of all  the labors on the Central Pacific, mainly because, unlike the work in  the tunnel , it makes for a spectacular  diorama. As well it should. Hanging from those [ropes], drilling  holes in the cliff, placing the fuses, and getting hauled up was a spectacular  piece of work. The white laborers couldn't do it. The Chinese  could, if not as a matter of course, then quickly and at least they  made it look this way easily. Young Lewis  Clement did the surveying and then took charge of overseeing the railroad  engineering at Cape Horn.  What Clement planned and the Chinese  made became one of the grandest sights to be seen along the entire Central  Pacific line. Trains would halt there so tourists  could get out of their cars to gasp and gape at the gorge and the grade.  Stephen E.
