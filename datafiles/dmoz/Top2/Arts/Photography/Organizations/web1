Happy Chinese New Year To All! Bryan Peterson Talk Â  âThe World Is Your Studioâ? Are you lacking in creative thought and vision? Do you often come back â after spending a whole day out shooting? Do you struggle with not knowing what lens to use? Do you know where to find the most compelling point of view? Do you often crop your photos AFTER you shoot in order to salvage something good from your efforts? Do you have some great ideas but then fail miserably in trying to execute these ideas? Utilizing a number of eye-catching and thought provoking imagery this presentation will take you on a remarkable and revealing journey towards the psychology of â. Of course most of us can see in the conventional sense, but most of us donât â in the creative sense because, quite simply, we are blind to it. This presentation will open your eyes to the vast and inspiring world of the elements of design and their emotional messages. These very elements are at the root of artistic vision and opening your eyes to them will unleash a level of perception of the world around in ways you had never before imagined. A thorough exploration of lens choice and point of view, two additional and very important elements in succeeding at âseeing creativelyâ are also discussed in depth, including the how, when and why a given lens and point of view ARE the ONLY combination for a given idea. And finally, a discussion on the creative use of electronic flash that is guaranteed to both shock and surprise you at not just how easy it is to employ but also showing you ideas where flash was used perhaps in ways that you never thought of before. Based in part on Bryanâs latest book EXPOSURE SOLUTIONS, this presentation will challenge you mentally as well as visually. As Henry David Thoreau once said, âThe question is not what you look at but what you see.â? If you are not â the perfect picture each and every time than this presentation promises to open your eyes, perhaps in ways youâve never experienced before.

Viki Gaul PSA Representative Â  2013 on February 13, 2014 by web master .         Mini Seminar 6: Unmanned Aerial Photography Monday February 10th. A little about usâ¦ flitelab.com Â came out of a growing interest in RC, and more specifically, theÂ multi-rotor area ofÂ the hobby.Â  With the DIY approach of most RC projects and the nicheÂ segment of multi-rotors, it is an on-going challenge to find the best components and get them shipped to Canada in a reliable and timely fashion, not knowing what surprises might arise from customs and related fees along the way.Â  With so many options coming out on a regular basis from all corners of the world, it is often a âtry and hopeâ? approach to see what you get after placing an order and not knowing how long the wait might be for it to arrive. To help address these issues and help give something back to other Canadian hobbyists,Â  flitelab.com Â was born.Â  Taking the ever-growing researchÂ knowledge and trial error usage of various components, we hope to bring a selection of good quality, useful products directly to Canada, creating a source within the country, and help reduce some of the headaches and delays noted above for both those established and new to the hobby. This has further grown into more business areas, with us now offering commercial UAV sales, support, and related aerial imaging services. We hope you find some valuable information and products here that can help grow your involvement and passion with the hobby or with your business needs. Mark Langille Mr. Langille has been actively involved in recreational RC aircraft builds, maintenance, and flight for the past 3 years. Â Mr. Langille started flitelab.com, an online store and resource center for multicopter aircraft in Canada, and deals on a regular basis with the sourcing and testing of components for both hobby and commercial use, in addition to consulting with customers on related topics and equipment and in custom aircraft builds. Â Mark was also part of the Transportation Safety Board team for the Swissair 111 accident investigation for 3 years, managing the imagery and document management aspects. Â Mr. Langille is also a member of MAAC (Model Aeronautics Association of Canada), and holds a Bachelors of Computer Science with option in Industrial Engineering from the Technical University of Nova Scotia. John Liddard Mr. John Liddard has flown RC multirotor aircraft for the last 2.5 years and has logged over 500 hrs.Â  John Liddard is a member of MAAC (Model Aeronautics Association of Canada) and is widely considered one of the foremost experts in mulitrotor design, construction and flight in the Atlantic region.Â  Mr. Liddard is also a licensed private pilot since 1988 with single engine land, sea and night ratings, and holds a Radiotelephone Operatorâs Restricted Certificate.Â  John Liddard has a long and extensive education and background in Electronic Engineering Technology, Computer Engineering Technology, and Physics from the Nova Scotia Institute of Technology and Dalhousie University. 2014 on February 1, 2014 by web master .
