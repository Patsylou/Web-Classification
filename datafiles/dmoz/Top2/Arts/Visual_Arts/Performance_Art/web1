We call our company because what drives us as artists is an intense curiosity about the world in which we live. As curious we have produced over 40 projects in a range of disciplines including performance, installation, publication and film. Each of the projects starts with a question such as; what smell reminds you of home? (On the Scent) ; what is lost and what is found in places undergoing rapid regeneration and change? (Lost Found) ; why is the American gun lobby promoting feminine protection? (Three Semi Automatics Just for Fun) , what do you long for and where do you belong? (be)longing) and what are gut feelings? (Autobiology) .Our investigations involve intimate, personal journeys alongside public research and enquiry. This leads us into collaborations and conversations with a huge range of people - truckstop waitresses, biological scientists, political refugees, occularists, nuclear weapons experts, sex workers, old folks' social groups and lost property workers to name a few. Curious was formed in 1996 by Leslie Hill and Helen Paris. Since then, the company has developed a reputation for its edgy, humorous interrogations of contemporary culture and politics, work that has been called as smart as it is seductive. In 2011 Curious were delighted to invite Claudia Barton to join the company as an Associate Artist. Curious books and DVDs can be purchased through the Artsadmin shop and the company runs a variety of workshops, mentoring and training sessions for artists nationally and internationally. Curious are Artsadmin artists. Curious Promote your Page too Upcoming Events Sorry, there is currently nothing scheduled.

AprÃ¨s Eupen, câest donc lâEspace MiniÃ¨res qui accueillera lâexposition itinÃ©rante dans le cadre de l'ApÃ©roculture du dimanche matin. Â« Une riviÃ¨re dans la ville Â» est une exposition itinÃ©rante d'art postal. Elle prÃ©sente les oeuvres de 59 artistes ou collectifs, provenant de 27 pays (Australie, BiÃ©lorussie, Finlande, Chili, ThaÃ¯lande, Japon, Tahiti, Canada, Belgique,â¦) sur le thÃ¨me de l'eau et la citÃ©, sans qu'aucune sÃ©lection n'ait lieu, ainsi que le veut l'usage en art postal. Tout objet crÃ©atif, envoyÃ© par la poste et estampillÃ© d'un cachet postal est une Åuvre d'art postal. Non commercial, populaire et mondial, l'art postal est social, ludique et aisÃ©ment accessible Ã  tous. Qui n'a jamais eu envie de personnaliser une enveloppe? Le projet Â« Une riviÃ¨re dans la ville Â» est nourri de mon environnement immÃ©diat; le risque actuel de perdre une trÃ¨s belle partie de la Vesdre au cÅur de Verviers. Un des rÃ´les de l'art n'a-t-il pas Ã©tÃ© depuis toujours de poser un regard poÃ©tique et crÃ©atif sur la vie et l'actualitÃ©? Selon la tradition de lâApÃ©roculture de lâEspace MiniÃ¨res, une tombola ouverte Ã  tous les visiteurs permettra de gagner une Åuvre dâart postal, spÃ©cialement crÃ©Ã©e pour lâoccasion et visible sur place. A voir absolument Ã  l'Espace MiniÃ¨res, 5, place GÃ©nÃ©ral Jacques Ã  Verviers, les dimanches 9 et 16 septembre 2007, de 10 Ã  13 heures. EntrÃ©e gratuite.

Thatâs a concrete dream. Around 15,000 square metres of open space, in the heart of the city. The ground and two floors dedicated to commercial gallery with international brands and high cost penthouses, added to underground parking on two levels, which completes financial return of rents. Facing you, at 15 metres, it is a concrete wall hiding the unloading wharf for trucks and, just behind the wharf, a high warehouse to provide all the complex of shops.

Câest lâaction qui efface lâenveloppe, lâidentitÃ© donnÃ©e par la peau. Chaque respiration porte en soi le principe de la fÃ©condation, câest un Ã©lÃ©ment qui pÃ©nÃ¨tre en un autre corps et lâÃ©mission du souffle en tÃ©moigne par sa forme.

This action erases the envelope, the identity given by the skin. Each breathing carries in oneself the principle of fecundation, it is an element which penetrates in another body and the emission of breath testifies that by its form. Giuseppe Penone, 1977 Lien permanent | Commentaires (0) | Facebook | matrice â (English text, click here) Il y a des intrÃ©pides, des pressÃ©s, des excitÃ©s. Il y a des aventuriers, des fougueux, des avant-gardistes. Il y en a qui brÃ»lent par-dedans, qui sortent nus toute l'annÃ©e. Il y en a qui gÃ¨lent par-dehors et laissent les volets baissÃ©s en permanence. Il y en a qui sont perpÃ©tuellement tendus, sous pression, condensÃ©s, brumeux et instables, Ã©cartelÃ©s entre le feu intÃ©rieur et la glace du dehors. C'est dans cette frontiÃ¨re violente de contraste que prend forme l'existence. Câest sur ce fil incertain que nous Ã©voluons. Câest dans ce non espace que nous nous mouvons et prenons conscience. La pression de lâair sur notre corps est la matrice de notre peau. Un rayon de lumiÃ¨re qui touche un objet provoque la sensation quâil existe une pression sur la surface illuminÃ©e. La pression de la lumiÃ¨re sur les yeux.

There are some adventurers, some impetuous, some avant-gardistes. There are some who burn inside, who leave naked all the year. There are some who freeze outside and leave permanently the shutters lowered. There are some who are perpetually tended, under pressure, digests, misty and unstable, quartered between the inner fire and the ice of outside. In this violent border of contrast, the existence takes on form. On this dubious wire, we evolve. In this non-space, we are driven and become aware. The pressure of the air on our body is the matrix of our skin. A ray of light which touches an object causes the feeling thereis a pressure on illuminated surface. Pressure of the light on the eyes.
