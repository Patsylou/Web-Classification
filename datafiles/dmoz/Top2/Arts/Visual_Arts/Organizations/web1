His drawings are strong and his colours are unique. Steinlen regularly participated in the Salon des Humouristes and during the war (1914-1918), he devoted himself to portraying the misfortunes and hardships of the invasions of Belgium and Serbia. These works are some of the most poignant and inspiring depictions of the war. Contemporary Artist Stephanie Dykes Stephanie Dykes is one of the director's of the Saltgrass Printmakers.
