What Is A Print? Original Antique Prints and Print Processes Contents: [ What Is A Print? | Woodcut Wood Engraving | Engraving | Etching ] Aquatint | Stipple | Mezzotint | Lithography | Reproductions ] Go to: [ Reference Library home page | Dictionary of printmaking terms | Glossary of abbreviations ] Paperback version of What Is A Print? | Philadelphia Print Shop home page ] What Is A Print? print is a piece of paper on which a design has been imprinted from a matrix made of some selected medium, usually stone, wood, or metal. In an original print the matrix is made by hand, as opposed to a reproduction , which is made by a photomechanical method . Any print issued prior to 1900 is considered to be an antique print , though non-mechanically made prints published before World War II are sometimes considered to be antiques. relief , intaglio , and planographic . relief print the image is printed from a raised surface on the matrix, so that the printmaker creates the matrix by cutting away that part which he does not want to show in the image. To create a relief print the ink is applied to the raised surface of the matrix, which is then pressed onto a sheet of paper. Examples of relief prints are woodcuts and wood engravings . intaglio print the image is printed from a recessed design in the matrix, so that the printmaker creates the matrix by cutting into it the design he wishes to imprint on the paper. To create an intaglio print the ink is pressed into the design cut in the matrix, the surface is wiped, and the ink is then transferred to the paper under pressure. This process creates the platemark which is the hallmark of an intaglio print. Examples of intaglio prints include engravings , etchings , aquatints , stipples , and mezzotints . planographic print the image is printed from a flat matrix, where the image was created on the surface by use of a grease crayon or with greasy ink. To create a planographic print, water (which is repulsed by the greasy image) is washed onto the surface, and then ink (which is held by the greasy image) is applied to the surface. A press is then used to transfer the image to the paper. Lithographs are planographic prints. Woodcut Wood Engraving chromoxylograph is an image printed in color from a wood block. Because these processes print in relief, they were often used to illustrate relief typeface books and newspapers. Engraving per se . Strong lines and sharp definition are characteristic of engravings. The earliest known line engravings were issued in the fifteenth century. A method of engraving in a steel plate, which allows for finer detail and many more impressions than does copper, was developed by Thomas Lupton in 1822. Etching Aquatint Stipple Mezzotint vice versa . In a mezzotint the metal plate is worked using a rocker, which roughens the entire surface of the plate with tiny holes and burrs. If the plate were printed at this time the image would be completely velvet black. Areas that are to appear in lighter tones or in white are smoothed out on the surface so that they will hold less ink. Mezzotint is an intaglio process, so prints made in this manner will have a platemark. The mezzotint process makes a very richly textured image and was used particularly for portraits. Mezzotint was invented by a German soldier named Ludwig von Siegen around 1642 but was refined later in that century by Abraham Blooteling. Used primarily in the eighteenth century, it was especially popular in England and was often called la manire anglaise . Mezzotinting was relatively unknown in the United States until it was brought to prominence by John Sartain . Lithography chromolithograph is a colored lithograph, with at least three colors, in which each color is printed from a separate stone and where the image is composed from those colors. A tinted lithograph is a lithograph whose image is printed from one stone and which has wash color for tinting applied from one or two other stones. Lithography is a planographic process and so no platemark is created when a lithograph is printed.

The Guild is affiliated with Pyramid Atlantic art center, Navigation Press, Lily Press, and of course George Mason University. Our philosophy is that artists enjoy working together and producing exciting work collaboratively. We feel the need to work in society and as part of the community, networking, sharing interest and having fun. The GMU Printmakers Guild will not operate as a work only guild; but a teaching and sharing group thatÂ freely gives all our knowledge of printmaking to any visitor during Guild hours on our Calendar. As an organization, the printmakerâs guild reaches out to other artists in the community though its exhibitions, demonstrations and lectures. It will be our goal to bring prominent Washington D.C. artists into the universities studios to share knowledge throughÂ lectures, making prints, or just conversations over coffeeÂ with our members. In addition to having free workshops a couple of times a month, we will offer print works for sale at reasonable prices in an effort to build a fund to pay visiting artists and to finance trips to printmaking conferences and workshopsÂ for the George Mason University students.Â  Membership is open to all - GMU Students, Faculty and Staff, as well as Community Members.Â  Questions can be directed toÂ  info@gmuprintmakersguild.org .Â  More info FaceBook Â  Art and Design Building George Mason University 4400 University Drive Fairfax, Virginia 22030 Â  We now have Saturday Hours for community members!
