I used to meditate daily and explore my self. I found many mes along the way of my search for enlightenment as I found many other possibilities of existence. The essence I have learned is Nothing is Perfect nor will it ever be, no matter how much I or anyone wishes it so or demands it to be. We are here to learn about being human and what we each contribute to that process. Life is an ADVENTURE! Sedona, AZ by the beauty, the art and the metaphysics which have played a large part in my life for many years now. I lived in Sedona for over 8 years until moving to Herndon, VA March 1, 1999. I am married, 44 years now, through some magnificent times and some low times. I have a daughter who is 23, my pride and joy. She teaches me so much about life and freely gives her thoughtful opinions, keeping me alert to my weaknesses. *SPARK* in every being. We are all capable of becoming better people to those in our environment, we make a conscious choice every day with everyone we meet . Tweets by @Aloel Be Sociable, Share!

Last Friday, while planning out a shoot w/ the photog, I made the off handed comment "I want to be INKED Girl of The Day!" - shoot on Saturday/Sunday was pretty fun. Fast Forward to this morning, some friends texted me while I was driving to work and sent messages on FaceBook to check the front page of Inked ... and, well... Awesome! I hosted a documentary screening (Hori Smoku Sailor Jerry) Sept 15, 2009 (if you can remember back that far) over at Roxie in the Mission. We had a little after party, too... overall it went quite well and a LOT of awesome ppl came through (over 700 RSVPs, the film was over capacity and the after party was off the CHAIN). So basically I hooked up my Brother from Another Mother as our photographer for the event. Here we are with party pooper 4.0 shot. (all official photos from this event are by AF3, except this first one of us by Allen M): DannyBoy - one of my sick ass tattooers - came through from Mom's. Check him out at his new chair - Let it Bleed Tattoo on Polk St (near Hemlock): Me D's "Mexican Soap Opera" photo: Uptown Erin: My new SFWeekly BFF Kevin: More pictures of me not being drunk (thank you to all tha Cabs DD's that took care of everyone this night, always make good choices): Oh and this is Saturday night (10/10) - Worked Make Out Room again and then headed to Delerium w/ JessicaG Spazzy Chris... Somedude : "Is that proper bar etiquette, painting your nails?" - Me : "I don't know... Everyone in here is too drunk to smell it. Who cares. I didn't have time at the other bar." I didn't get any good photos of my halloween costume from last year (interpretation of Sylvia Ji paintings of Katrinas) - Luckily Antonio wanted to shoot it so we recreated that mess and went for it. I'm only two photos in on the editing process so this is all you get for now. Photography by AF3 Studio. My dear Shrinkle has just put up a sneak peak PR image for her new cosmetics line, Sugarpill. Shrinkle we are all so proud of you, I know you've been working on this for years it is amazing to see our friends and family's hard work make their dreams come true.
