See also Jayarava's Blog Mantras are the mysterious sound symbols associated with Indian spiritual practice. We often ask "what does a mantra mean?", but a better question is what does it do? A Buddhist mantra evokes and invokes qualities of the Awakened mind. Mantras bring us into relationship with Enlightenment, and are a vehicle by which our consciousness can awaken to the way things really are. They are rooted in age old traditions emphasising the interconnectedness of all things. For Buddhists a mantra may also be an expression of devotion towards, or faith in, the Three Jewels . As writing encapsulates sounds, so a written mantra captures something of the symbolism of the mantric sound. Visible Mantra presents calligraphy of the seed syllables (bÃÂ«ja) and mantras used in the most common Buddhist visualisation and devotional practices performed in the Triratna Buddhist Order . Additional mantras from the Shingon School and Tibetan lineages are included. The main script used on Visible Mantra is SiddhaÃ¡Â¹ , but it also features Tibetan, and Lantsa/Ranjana examples.

The Qur'anic Script Palaeography On The Origins Of The Kufic Script hijra , A. Jones, Islamic Culture Concise List Of Arabic Manuscripts Of The Qur'n Attributable To The First Century Hijra . The study of ancient manuscripts of the Qur'an is steadily gathering pace. In decades past, a few scholars have compiled lists of Qur'anic manuscripts attributable to the 1st century hijra . Although helpful, these lists contain only the barest details, usually only the name of the manuscript concerned or sometimes even less. With this in mind, we have constructed this document that contains additional details providing further insights into these valuable manuscripts, accompanied by full bibliographic references. A discussion of how scholars date early Qur'anic manuscripts and an assessment of the value of these manuscripts is also provided along with some detailed mathematical calculations. Should one ponder over this list, they will come to the appreciation scholars involved in this field of study suffer from an embarrassment of riches. Quite simply, there is no other work from the Late Antiquity that comes close to the Qur'an in terms of the number of their earliest manuscripts including textual content. Radiocarbon (Carbon-14) Dating And The Qur'nic Manuscripts . Radiocarbon dating of ancient Qur'anic manuscripts in the literature is very rare. Can radiocarbon dating provide more accurate results than traditional palaeographic techniques and associated methods? A discussion of the scientific principles underpinning this radiometric dating technique, together with some practical examples from actual Qur'anic manuscripts, highlights the strengths and weaknesses of this procedure as compared to more traditional palaeographic based methods. Dated Texts Containing The Quran From 1-100 AH / 622-719 CE . The corpus of dated texts containing the Qur'an from 1-100 AH / 622-719 CE proving the early codification of the Qur'an in Arabic. 2. Examples Of The Qur'anic Manuscripts The n Of At Tashkent (Samarqand), Uzbekistan, From 2nd Century Hijra . A folio from a Qur'anic manuscript in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, commonly attributed to caliph n, has recently been subject to radiocarbon tests at Oxford, United Kingdom. Although the dates generated by this radiometric technique at either confidence level do not rule out the possibility that this manuscript was produced in n's time, palaeographic studies suggest an 8th century (2nd century hijra ) date. The n Of At The Topkapi Museum, Istanbul, Turkey, From 1st / 2nd Century Hijra . This manuscript was written in kufic script and contains 408 folios. The extant folios contain more than 99% of the text of the Qur'an . Only two folios are missing. The manuscript shows the script, illumination and marking of vowels that are from the Umayyad times (i.e., late 1st century / early 2nd century of hijra ). The n Of At The TÃÂ¼rk ve ÃÂ°slam Eserleri MÃÂ¼zesi (Turkish and Islamic Art Museum), Istanbul, Turkey, From 1st / 2nd Century Hijra . A manuscript written in the kufic script on gazelle skin, and contains 439 folios. Interestingly, on the last folio of the manuscript is written in kufic script Katabahu UthmÃ n bin AffÃ n fÃÂ« sanat thalathyn (UthmÃ n bin AffÃ n wrote in the year 30). However, the script and ornamentation negates this possibility. The Qur'Ã n Of ÃÂ¿UthmÃ n At St. Petersburg (Russia), Katta Langar, BukhÃ rÃ And Tashkent (Uzbekistan), From 2nd Century Hijra . A manuscript written in the late the h script, containing about 40% of the text of the Qur'an, with full texts of 22 surahs and fragments of another 22. The n Of At The Al-Hussein Mosque, Cairo, Egypt, From 1st / 2nd Century Hijra . This monumental Qur'anic manuscript on parchment showing a well-formed kufic script, written in dark-brown ink with sparse diacritical marks and no ornamentation. Total number of folios are 1087. Size: 57 cm x 68 cms. The height of the musaf is 40 cm and weighs 80 kgs. The extant folios contain more than 99% of the text of the Qur'an . The n Of At The Egyptian National Library (Dr Al-Kutub Al-MisrÃÂ«yya), Cairo, Egypt, From 1st / 2nd Century Hijra . A monumental Qur'anic manuscript on parchment showing a well-formed kufic script. Total number of folios are 306. The script is slightly sloping backwards with tall ascenders and is strongly reminiscent of the type of well executed kufic script exhibited during the Umayyad period. There is no vocalisation and a very limited amount of consonantal pointing (i.e., diacritical marks) Ã¢ on some folios there are no diacritical marks at all. Multi-coloured (e.g., red, green, black, brown) diagonally arranged dashes are usually used to indicate verse-endings. Groups of five verses are marked with medallions and square cartouches containing quatrefoil emblems are used to indicate groups of ten verses. There are some arcaded bands that separate srahs without mentioning the name of the srah , some containing triangular-shaped crenellations. THE QUR'ANIC MANUSCRIPTS ATTRIBUTED TO ALI B. ABI TALIB The third and fourth caliphs, i.e., n and AlÃÂ«, share a very interesting aspect attribution of of numerous manuscripts of the Qur'an. In this section, we will present the manuscripts attributed to AlÃÂ« b. AbÃÂ« TÃ lib. The n Of AlÃÂ« b. AbÃÂ« TÃ lib (The S Musaf) From 1st / 2nd Century Hijra . This manuscript was written in kufic script and contains 275 folios. The extant folios contain about 86% of the text of the Qur'an . The script is slightly sloping backwards and is reminiscent of the type of well-executed kufic script exhibited during the Umayyad period. Single dots were placed above, beside or below the letters. Two dots were placed to indicate the nunation known as tanwÃÂ«n . Diacritical marks are represented by dashes. The ending of verses is indicated by a series of 5 or 6 dashes. The srahs are separated by wide horizontal bands in the form of rectangles. The inside of the band is decorated differently for every srah separator. The sequence of the srahs is just like what is seen in modern day copies of the Qur'an. The codex is contains large ornamentaled circles to indicate every 10 verses. Ornamented rectangular shaped signs are used to indicate every 100 verses. FIRST CENTURY HIJRA Below are the examples of the 1st century hijra manuscripts written in the h and the Kufic scripts. Codex S I Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From MidÃ¢1st Century Of Hijra . hijra and consists of 80 folios . The leaves from Codex S I have appeared under the hammer at auction houses like Christies, Sotheby's and Bonhams; the most recent one at Christies in 2008 fetching a remarkable sum of ÃÂ£2,200,000, around fifteen times the estimated asking price. This codex exemplifies the principal tendencies of the early h script and is of tremendous importance regarding the textual transmission of the Qur'an, Arabic palaeography, codicology and other related disciplines. A detailed description of the folios, including the textual content of scriptio inferior and scriptio inferior , is provided. Codex S DAM 01-25.1 Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From 1st Century Of Hijra . Written in the h script. The codex consists of 29 folios . h ijÃ zÃÂ« manuscript is the presence of s ÃÂ« rah al-FÃ tihah which is followed immediately by s ÃÂ« rah al-Baqarah . The presence of s ÃÂ« rah al-FÃ tihah is rare in the Qur'ans from first century hijra , the only other known example being the Great Umayyad Qur', DAM 20-33.1 , also from S. Codex S DAM 01-29.1 Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From 1st Century Of Hijra . Written in the h script. This codex was probably written by at least two different copyists as the scripts differ in various folios. There are few diacritical marks but no vocalization. The sÃÂ«rahs are separated by simple ornaments. There are 35 folios in this codex and they have ~22% text of the Qur'an. Located at Dr al-Makhtt, S, Yemen. The Great Umayyad Qur' (Codex S DAM 20-33.1) From The Time Of Caliph Al-Wald, Late 1st Century Hijra . This monumental and the earliest kufic Qur'anic manuscript, perhaps one of the most well-studied and is dated to the last decade of the 1st century of hijra , around 710 - 715 CE, in the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Wald. This manuscript is unique in the sense that it open with a group of full page images. These images are the only known Qur'an illustrations and are absolutely unique among extant Qur'an manuscripts. Apparently 25(?) folios from this codex survive . Located at Dr al-Makhtt, S, Yemen. Arabe 328a Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From 1st Century Hijra At The Bibliothque Nationale, Paris . This is one of the most important manuscripts written in the h script from 1st century hijra . It has 58 folios; 56 of them at the the Bibliothque Nationale, Paris , and one each at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana ( Vat. Ar. 1605 ) and the Nasser David Khalili Collection (Acc. no. KFQ 60 ). This manuscript has 58 folios which contains about 26% of the total text of the Qur'an. The discussion on the folio at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana is available here . . Written in the h script. It has 6 folios ; 4 ( Arabe 6140a , Bibliothque Nationale, Paris) + 2 ( Camb. Ms. Add. 1125 , University Library, University of Cambridge). These folios contain about ~4.2% of the text of the Qur'an. The format is vertical, and the script which is thin and slender, also has a distinct vertical emphasis, despite the slant to the right. The text is written in brown-black ink, with occasional diacritical strokes. . Written in the h script. Total number of folios are 24 = 20 ( Arabe 330g , Bibliothque Nationale, Paris) + 4 ( Is. 1615 II , Chester Beatty Library, Dublin, Ireland). These folios contain about ~15% of the text of the Qur'an. MS. Or. 2165 Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From The 1st Century Hijra In The British Library . Hailed as by the earlier keepers of it as probably the earliest Qur'an ever brought to Europe, the British Library says that it is the oldest Qur'an manuscript in their possession. This manuscript is written in the h (or ma'il ) script. It is usually dated around the mid-second century of hijra . However, a recent study by Yasin Dutton has shown that this manuscript is remarkably similar to the first century Qur'anic manuscript MS. Arabe 328a in the Bibliothque Nationale , Paris. Based on the similarity between MS. Arabe 328a and MS. Or. 2165 , he suggests redating this manuscript to the time just before the Umayyad Caliph Walid ( r . 86-96 AH), i.e., within the period 30-85 AH with the latter end of this time scale being safer. This manuscript has 121 folios which contains about 53% of the total text of the Qur'an. . Written in the h script though listed as kufic srahs is characterized by a series of sets of dots forming triangles to fill the line. The beginning and end of the srahs is characterized by ornamentation and with srah heading written in the naskhi script, both of which are done inconsistently by a later hand.

The Mingana Palimpsest Ã¢ A Manuscript Containing The Qur'Ã n From 1st Century Hijra . Mrs. Agnes Smith Lewis was the first scholar to publish this unique palimpsest that has scriptio superior which is a Christian material (Arabic Christian homilies) and the scriptio inferior consisting of the Qur'anic verses. Mingana presented a full transcription of the Qur'anic text of the scriptio inferior of the manuscript, with the parallel text from the present day Qur'an. But his claim of in the Qur'anic text has come under suspicion partly because of his own history of being involved in suspected forgeries. Recent study by Fedeli on this manuscript has confirmed that the inevitable and easy conclusion is that all of Mingana's transcription can be suspected to be wrong. A recent surge of interest in this manuscript is due to the fact that the scriptio inferior was written in the h script. M. 1572 Ã¢ A Qur'nic Manuscript From 1st Century Of Hijra .

This beautiful codex is one of the two Qur'ans found in S which resemble the monumental codex from Syria, the Great Umayyad Qur' (Codex S Ã¢ DAM 20-33.1 ) .

The letters are spaciously distributed and once connected individual letters tend to blend with their neighbours. The total number of folios in this codex are not known but 10 of them have been published so far . Located at Dr al-Makhtt, S, Yemen. Codex TIEM E 12995 Ã¢ A Qur'Ã nic Manuscript From 2nd Century Of Hijra . Written in the hijÃ zÃÂ« script. The interesting part of this manuscript is the use of different colour of inks. Four varieties of ink have been used for the copy of the text. In addition of the most common used brown ink, the scribe also employed a red, an orange and a green one. These inks are not connected with the beginning or the end of sÃÂ«rahs . The usage of inks does not follow any rule or sequence. However, an interesting patterning of the coloured inks is applied to the last three lines of a s ÃÂ« rah and the first three lines of the next one. For example, the end of sÃÂ«rah al-NisÃ is written in green and contrasts wiith the first and third lines of sÃÂ«rah al-MÃ 'idah which are written in red, the second one being also in green. Only 22 folios of this codex survive . It is written in the reading of Ibn mir. Located at the TÃÂ¼rk ve ÃÂ°slam Eserleri MÃÂ¼zesi ( Turkish and Islamic Art Museum ), Istanbul, Turkey.

A folio from a Qur'anic manuscript in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, has recently been subject to radiocarbon tests at Oxford, United Kingdom. Although the dates generated by this radiometric technique at either confidence level do not rule out the possibility that this manuscript was produced in Ã¢Uthman's time, palaeographic studies suggest an 8th century (2nd century hijra ) date.

BIDDINGTON'S APPRAISALS VALUATIONS BIDDINGTON'S GALLERY SHOPPING Islamic Calligraphy from a Private Collection two key facts that will help you appreciate the elevated position of calligraphy in the Islamic world: First, specific depictions of the human form are considered sacrilege in Islam verses of the Holy Koran figure significantly in everyday Islamic life. calligrapher , because he could both delight the eye and feed the soul, held an honored place in the culture . The value of calligraphy was such that it could be readily converted into currency: calligraphic panels traded for their weight in gold . 1100 AH to 1300 AH --making them approximately 17th through 19th century on the western calendar. the religious language would be Arabic. My works, again because of the part of the Mideast where they originate, are specifically Shiite (followers of Ali-- Mohammed's son-in-law ) Muslim. secular language in this same part of the world was Persian. signed sometimes with an epithet as well as--or instead of--a name. Emerald Pen because he is so gifted. He was a teacher of one of the moghul princes. However, you will note that the talent is attributed to the pen rather than to the calligrapher himself. many of the pieces are dated as well. However, sometimes fine pieces are not signed. If, for instance, the calligrapher worked in the employ of a specific prince, it would be unseemly to sign his name to pieces produced under the auspices of such a patron. mounted in colorful embossed foil papers came from a princely collection . Why is it that you don't know the name of the prince? decorative illumination as well as calligraphy . Did the calligraphers illuminate as well as write calligraphy? Illumination and calligraphy are distinct skills and the work would have been done by different persons. In the area where these works were produced, calligraphy is considered much the higher art form. This is quite different from calligraphy produced in Turkey. (You may have seen the current exhibition of Ottoman Calligraphy at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. ) In Turkish calligraphy, the focus is on the decoration and the script is secondary and usually of only one calligraphic style: khat e NASKH . khat ? khat e TAALIQ , khat e NAASTALIQ khat e NASKH khat e SHIKAST . inventiveness and variety within a style of script is endlessly fascinating. In the khat e NASKH piece, the calligrapher has undertaken an exercise in continuity . The only breaks occur with the letter "A" which by definition, must be separate. khat e NAASTALIQ piece, where the calligrapher praises his love's features in words repeatedly using the letter "N" . paper is called "abri" and was invented in Turkey. Some calligraphers incorporated it as another element in their design. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  BIDDINGTON'S EXPERT CONSULTANCY ARCHIVES:  Islamic Amulet Collector Speaks Islamic Calligraphy Collector Speaks Islamic Illuminated Books Collector Speaks Characteristics of Islamic Calligraphy and Process Los Angeles County Museum Islamic Art Collection Contact Biddington's about Expert Consultancy BIDDINGTON'S upmarket, online art gallery and auctions and BIDDINGTON'S Contemporary Art Gallery by using the links below.
