She will perform this wall rubbing ritual for one hour, allowing visitors the opportunity to ask questions about her process. Oliviaâs desire is that the outcome of this performance will further inspire archiving, history keeping, documenting and storytelling in this community. Round 40: Monuments: Right Beyond the Site Viewing Hours Round Events Saturday, March 29th from 4 7PM Free and open to the public Wednesday through Sunday 12 â 5PM 2505 â 2517 Holman Project Row Houses (PRH) is pleased to announce the opening of seven new art projects in the historic shotgun houses on Holman Street in Houstonâs Third Ward. Round 40: Monuments: Right Beyond the Site will be on view from March 29-June 22, 2014, and feature installations by Otabenga Jones Associates , the Houston-based artist collective consisting of Dawolu Jabari Anderson, Jamal Cyrus, Kenya Evans, and Robert A. Pruitt. The collective will take a different approach to previous Rounds at PRH and utilize all seven of the Art Houses for Round 40 through installations that happen on and off-site. The off-site installations will be in collaboration with identified Sites (mentioned below) and become permanent art works to the Third Ward landscape. Monuments: Right Beyond the Site will examine what strategies, traditionally used by African Americans, to mark, beautify, or commemorate public and private space that have been created and sustained for a number of years in Third Ward. As the neighborhood continues to change, Otabenga Jones Associates will create installations that serve as a means to communicate and celebrate the values of cooperation, entrepreneurship, self-determination, resistance, and communal responsibility. The monuments will highlight individuals, institutions, and events that have been vital to the cultural landscape and economic life of the historic Third Ward. The sites have been chosen through dialogues with various sub-communities in Third Ward, and will delineate the area in a way that is based on the values of the project stated above. The artist-designed monuments will be permanent alterations to the Third Ward landscape. It is our hope that this project will in some ways counter the erasures of history that are occurring within the neighborhood, and will continue to occur as it goes through its demographic shifts. The sites that have been identified are: the former Lanier East Hall Menâs Dormitory at Texas Southern University, the Progressive Amateur Boxing Association, the Peopleâs Party Clinic, Unity Bank, and Blue Triangle YMCA. Sign painters, Bobby V, Israel McCloud, Walter Stanciell, and Bobby Ray, who represent an aesthetic which is traditionally seen in the Third Ward landscape for marketing small businesses, have been commissioned to create new signs that will stimulate individual economic sustainability for each one of them. One of the Art Houses will be used as an education house to conduct workshops, lectures, and gatherings throughout the run of the Round. Round 40 is part of PRHâs 20 th Anniversary celebrations that will continue throughout the year and is organized by Public Art Director Ryan N. Dennis. Round 40 Events Programs Third Ward Community Market and Talent Showcase: Saturday, March 29 th from 2pm to 7pm Artists Talk: Saturday, March 29 th from 3pm to 4pm Opening Reception: Saturday, March 29th from 4pm to 7pm In April 2014, the collective will participate in the CounterCurrent Festival which is being organized by the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts. View all events About Otabenga Jones Associates: Otabenga Jones Associates is a Houston-based artist collective founded in 2002 by artist and educator Otabenga Jones in collaboration with members Dawolu Jabari Anderson, Jamal Cyrus, Kenya Evans, and Robert A. Pruitt. The groupâs pedagogical mission is manifested in a myriad of forms, e.g. actions, writings, DJ sets, and installations. In scope the collectiveâs mission is three-fold: to underscore the complications of black representation, to maintain and promote the core principles of the Black radical tradition and (in the words of the late Russell Tyrone Jones) âteach the truth to the young black youthâ?. Work by Otabenga Jones Associates has appeared in exhibitions at the Studio Museum of Harlem and Whitney Museum of American Art (Whitney Biennial), in New York City; the High Museum, Atlanta; and the Menil Collection and Contemporary Art Museum Houston, Houston, among others. Right-of-Way Acquisition Performance Â  Location:Â 2507 Holman StreetÂ  Date and Time: Saturday, March 1, 2014 at 2pm Â  For the duration of Round 39 artist Jessica Vaughn has built an archive of sound from Freeways 288 and 59 that border the 3rd Ward. This collection of real-time movement of people, automobiles, material and goods is the springboard for her culminating performance that will take place in her installationÂ  Right-of-Way Acquisition Â at Project Row Houses. An assembly line with the artistsâ own rendition of the brick making process, amplified by live and prerecorded sound of the production itself.Â  Handmade blue bricks will be fabricated from Masa, dough made from freshly prepared hominy, and paper and then stacked in the space.Â  The transformation of granulated Masa into bricks for stacking and building conflates ideas of spatial movement with the politics of urban access to resources and labor. The result will be a performance of competing sounds from the expressway and sounds of the body at work.Â  The task of manufacturing these blocks will result in the stacking of them in front of the installationâs megaphone.Â Â  Artists Jamal Cyrus, Abijan Johnson and Autumn Knight will perform Vaughns score that loosely samples sound from Lightinâ Hopkins song âDowling Streetâ?.

Freedman Plaza View Exhibition About Mission History Board Staff Get Involved Careers Consulting Mission Public Art Fund brings dynamic contemporary art to a broad audience in New York City by mounting ambitious free exhibitions of international scope and impact that offer the public powerful experiences with art and the urban environment. Public Art Fund is a 501(c)(3), non-profit organization that relies on contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations to support the development and presentation of our temporary exhibitions and outreach programs. History Public Art Fund was founded by Doris C. Freedman (1928-1981), a champion of public art who served as New York City's first Director of Cultural Affairs, President of the Municipal Art Society of New York, and was a tireless supporter of New York City's Percent for Art legislation. In 1971, she founded the Public Arts Council while at the same time serving as president of City Walls Inc. Under her leadership, both organizations developed programs to explore the potential for art to become an integral aspect of urban public spaces. In 1977, she merged the two to form the independent, non-profit Public Art Fund. Since its inception, Public Art Fund has presented more than four hundred artists' exhibitions and projects at sites throughout New York Cityâs five boroughs, making it possible for artists to engage diverse audiences and, along the way, redefine public art in relation to the changing nature of contemporary art. Early Public Art Fund projects include Messages to the Public (1982-1990), an exhibition series that ran on an 800-square foot animated lightboard in Times Square and featured more than 70 artists, among them Guerrilla Girls, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince, Kiki Smith, and David Wojnarowicz. More recently, we have presented iconic exhibitions like Anish Kapoorâs Sky Mirror (2006); Olafur Eliassonâs The New York City Waterfalls (2008); Sol LeWitt: Structures, 1965-2006 (2011); Tatzu Nishi: Discovering Columbus ; and have worked with dozens of emerging artists to realize new works that extend their practice into new realms.
