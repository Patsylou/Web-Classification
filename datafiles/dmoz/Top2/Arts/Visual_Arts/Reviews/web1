Still playing catch up on the reviews, last February (jeez! was it that long ago) I made it out to Pointe Claire to see their group show called Under Construction. As you might expect, I was quite pleased and entertained by the show. It consisted of work by Thomas Corriveau , Martin DÃ¨silets , Guillaume Lachapelle and Sean Whalley , curated by Amanda Johnston and Alexandra Hofmaenner it was a smoothly done collection of some widely different art. I'm not entirely certain if I am as much a fan of M. DÃ¨silets' work as I am of the other three artists, but they all fit in very nicely to the overall theme (which if you hadn't quite figured out was 'architecture'). And this might also have to do with my sense of the show being somewhat fragmented. While each of the artists did work that had strong " I'm building stuff " happening, I missed any real connections between them, beyond that. Similar to Hampstead , Hochelaga , Saint Leonard and Pointe Claire all being part of Montreal, yet also being very different neighborhoods. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 28.5.07 links to this post There's all sorts of bafflegab and gobbledy-gook happening in this press release about yesterday's Montreal Museum's Day . Nowhere can I find any press release or other sort of factual documentation about attendance at the JournÃ©e des musÃ©es montrÃ©alais in 2006 which is sort of surprising since it was the 20th anniversary. But I scratch my head when last week they released something that ostensibly showed how 125,000 people participated in 2006 , and then this year they state that they " maintained last year's attendance once again " but they only got 108,000 people. A 14% drop in attendance isn't maintaining anything. This article by Cheryl Cornacchia in the Montreal Gazette does a better job of analyzing the results. Le Devoir on the other hand doesn't let the facts get in the way of a photo op posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 28.5.07 links to this post I just set up a Google News Alert to track who gets more internet press in English, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer or David Altmejd. Right now there are nine for Altmejd and five for Lozano-Hemmer .

M. Mavrikakis gets paid to write about them, then M. Mavrikakis gets paid by all three levels of government to curate a show with the same artists that he wrote about. The readers of Voir are not informed that he is using his job as a reviewer to curate at the same time, and while the audience for Artefact Montreal 2007 are informed that he is a reviewer the extent of his double dipping is not revealed.

It must mean that the Murray Guy Gallery is as fancy-ass and very prestigious as the biennale, right? And according to this article in ArtCal posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 24.5.07 links to this post Mr. Wenderoff is interning here at the gallery, this is what he wrote about the Bruce Nauman show There is one image from the Bruce Nauman exhibit at the Musee dâart contemporain de Montreal that really stayed with me. It was not the One Hundred Fish Fountain, nor was it Naumanâs famed The True Artist helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths. It wasnât really even of a work of at. I was exploring a back passage which eventually lead me to Anthro/Socio (Rinde Spinning) room, where I saw a security guard trying to make sense of the situation. He looked absolutely baffled. After he noticed I was there too, and that I was part of the group of people that claim to understand it, he left me to experience the videos myself. I left about thirty seconds afterwards as I can only handle videos of screaming, spinning, upside down heads for so long. I donât know if I have ever seen anyone as confused as that security guard, at least not in a real long time. The poor guy was just trying to figure out what the hell was going on in that room, and Iâd assume also why anyone who would appreciate such things. If he had asked me, I wouldnât have been able to tell him. I myself have no clue what the hell was going on in that room. The same can be said for the other rooms with videos, Clown Torture, Office Edit II and Square Dance. The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths (Window or Wall Sign) , 1967, Neon tubing with clear glass tubing suspension frame, 59 x 55 x 5 inches; Ed. 2/3, Collection KrÃ¶ller-MÃ¼ller Museum, Otterlo, The Netherlands, Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) Well thatâ not entirely true. I was, to an extent, able to comprehend what was occurring, the issue I had more trouble resolving was why it was occurring. If I have the choice, which I usually do, I would rather not watch a video of a clown sitting on a toilet while other videos of said clown screaming âNo No No No!â? engulf me in noise. I worked one office job in my life, and it sucked, and when I left the office I left for good, so why would I want to watch a video of an office at night, as I could in Office Edit II? Iâm sure itâs a social commentary of some sort in Naumanâs mind. Whatever. The videos, needless to say, did not do it for me. On the other hand, Naumanâs neon work in the Elusive Signs part of the exhibit is great. There are tons of wires needed for this part of the exhibit, and while they are quite visible, do not interfere. Flashing lights on some works do not distract the spectator when viewing a nearby piece. I have a soft spot for word games, so maybe Iâm a bit biased when it comes to discussion of such pieces as None Sing Neon Sign, which is simply the words none, sing, neon, and sign, none sing being an anagram of neon sign. Maybe I'm just easily impressed, but I think thatâs pretty cool. Run from Fear, Fun from Rear , 1972, Neon tubing with clear glass tubing suspension frame, two parts, 8 x 24 x 2 Â½ inches each; Ed. 4/6, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Gerald S. Elliott Collection, Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) There is also an installation piece called Helman Gallery Parallelogram where one walks through a tiny space in a narrow wall into a room lit with neon green, then out another tiny passageway. It hurt my eyes and made me feel a little claustrophobic. Probably should have read the sign that warns that spectators may feel confined in the installation before I went in there. One Hundred Fish Fountain, 2005, 97 poissons en bronze de 7 formes diffÃ©rentes, suspendus avec du fil en acier, inoxydable sur un treillis mÃ©tallique. Dimensions approximatives du bassin : 7,6 m x 8,5 m x 20,3 cm, Avec lâaimable permission de la Donald Young Gallery, Chicago, Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) Photo : Richard-Max Tremblay The highlight of the exhibit is the One Hundred Fish Fountain (which actually only contains 97 fish), located at the back of the exhibit. The sound of the water flowing overwhelms the neighbouring room, and draws you in to behold the fountain. Thatâs fine, there were some more videos in the neighbouring room, so not missing a whole lot by zooming through there towards the sound. It really does feel as though the fish are swimming in the flowing water, even though the fish are actually suspended above the stagnant pool of water. All in all itâs a solid exhibit, showing a fascinating artist who works with various media and definitely worth checking out. I just canât help but feel the security guards working there think we must be crazy. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 24.5.07 links to this post Yesterday I was at the press preview for the Bruce Nauman exhibit that is opening at the MusÃ©e d'art contemporain de MontrÃ©al tomorrow. As has become a very bad standard operating practice, in the press package there was a notice from SODRAC that stated in unequivocal terms that the pictures couldn't be cropped, and that there must be a copyright notice. Well, if you notice this is the current front page of the museum's website. The only copyright notice I see on it is this one: "Â© 2005-2007 MusÃ©e d'art contemporain de MontrÃ©al." Then if you look at this picture It appears to be the exact same one as on the front page of the museum's website, only not cropped. What gives? Why isn't SODRAC enforcing its policy with the museum? Or is there something I don't know? Then just so I don't have to spend any more time in court ('cuz it really ain't fun) the fine print Mean Clown Welcome, 1985, Tubes au nÃ©on montÃ©s sur monolithe de mÃ©tal, Collection Udo and Anette Brandhorst Collection, Cologne, Avec l'aimable permission de la Donald Young Gallery, Chicago, Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007) [ update 5:04 pm: And can anyone find "Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007)" anywhere near or around this article in La Presse ? Or this photo in La Presse ? ] [ update 5:50 pm: Does anyone know if there is a "Â©Bruce Nauman / SODRAC (2007)" anywhere near or around this advertisement? Or what negotiations were required in order to allow the picture to be modified and used for commercial purposes? - Thanks a gazillion and a half times to Michael Boyle for taking the picture of the ad and for letting me post it here. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 24.5.07 links to this post Wednesday, May 23, 2007 posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 23.5.07 links to this post The FBI makes a mistake and Hasan Elahi (an artist) responds. The backstory if I am being too oblique posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 23.5.07 links to this post I have now seen all the visual art at the Biennale de MontrÃ©al 2007 . I would like to go back to see the stuff at the Ecole Bourget one more time, so I can write something long and involved (or potentially long and boring) but I do not know if I will be able to do so, I have a very serious backlog of shows I need to write about and a bunch of other work that needs to be done as well. So in case I don't get to see the show again, without further ado the grades for the various art shown at the Biennale this year: 2boys.tv - C+ Scoli Acosta - B- David Altmejd - A- Stephen Andrews - C+ Michael Awad & Evan Penny - A+ BGL - B- Eleanor Bond - B Boris Chukhovich - C- Dana Claxton - B- Lynne Cohen - C Comic Craze - D- Previously reviewed Chris Cran - C Christine Davis - A Beth Derbyshire - B+ Iran do Espirito Santo - B+ Julie Doucet - C+ Geoffrey Farmer - C- Jeff Funnell - B Noam Gonick & Luis Jacob - B David Hoffos - A+ Ignacio Iturria - B+ Sarah Anne Johnson - B Brian Jungen - C Jesper Just - C Janice Kerbel - C Will Kwan - C- Virgil Marti - C+ Luanne Martineau - B- Scott McFarland - C+ Kent Monkman - C Montreal Comic City - Not graded because I haven't seen it, and there are friends of mine who made it and curated it.

Numa - A Paul P. - C+ Graeme Patterson - A+ Peaches - C+ Annie Pootoogook - B Theo Sims - A Ryan Sluggett - B Bill Smith - A+ Scott Treleaven - B- Susan Turcot - B- Paulo Whitaker - B posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 23.5.07 links to this post Yesterday Sarah Milroy reviewed the Biennale de MontrÃ©al 2007 , and in it she wrote " But - as the crowds that poured into Montreal for the opening can attest... " One problem, there are no crowds. I asked when I was there last Friday, and was told that the first weekend had been good and that they had received about 150 visitors at the Ecole Bourget. However last Thursday they had only received 36 visitors, and I was visitor 24 on Friday at about 3:30 pm. Then today I decided to return once again before writing anything, and they were closed. On the main entrance there was nothing except a sign saying "Open Everyday : 12:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m." Just like they say on the website . Over on the door to the annex, not the main entrance they have a small sign in French only that states that due to the Bus and Metro strike they had to change hours to Thursday to Sunday noon to 7 pm. Which is about as much balderdash as us getting snow in July. Because of the strike there is no service on the weekends , so I would understand if they closed on Saturday and Sundays - but they are open. Because of the strike there is public transportation during the morning rush hour and the evening rush hour , so I would understand if instead of " Everyday : 12:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m." like they write on their website , they opened everyday but at 9 AM and then closed at 6 PM. But to blame they strike and the inability of their employees to get into work is flat out wrong and incorrect. Plus I would imagine that most if not all of their staff were students who had been depending on that summer job. And that most of the money to pay them was from some government program. If I am correct, then what I want to know is where is the money going that they saved? All the art has been paid for, all the rent has been paid for, the transport has been paid for, so they decided that due to bad marketing and promotion they were going to lay off (or reduce the hours) of some students? I don't like it one bit. [ update 4:20 pm: Well we will be able to see if I am right or if it truly is because of the strike at the STM that they changed hours. Next Tuesday right after my court appearance I will be at the Ecole Bourget. The strike is only going to be lasting another 48 hours before the governement legislates everyone back to work . posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 23.5.07 links to this post Tuesday, May 22, 2007 Finally something went my way! if you've seen American Streamlined Design: The World of Tomorrow at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts you will know that there is a wicked cool record player there. And that David A. Hanks, the curator was witty enough to have decided to include a 78 rpm record of the song Streamlined Mama by Buddy Jones on it. As you're at the museum, it is mighty tough to hear the song (it ain't like you can go up and ask one of the guards to play it for you) - but if you would like to hear what you're missing, click on this ( stream , ogg vorbis ) [ 2.9 MB, 2:26 minutes ] or Extra Special Props and Thanks (along with some shouts outs and high fives in gratitude) to Zinhoff the best blogger in Croatia for helping me immensely with this post. posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 22.5.07 links to this post Or if you can't save the MusÃ©e de cire , you might want to consider making an offer posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 22.5.07 links to this post If as they state in this advertisement that they pay $125,000 (which is I assume per year) I do not understand why they have such difficulty in retaining employees. The previous job advertisements that I've seen are from May 2006 , February 16, 2007 and February 25, 2007 . Or maybe they are thinking of selling art on cruise ships like Park West Galleries posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 22.5.07 links to this post But unfortunately in this post about Rafael Lozano-Hemmer representing Mexico at the Venice Biennale, the words Montreal, Quebec and Canada do not appear anywhere.

It seems like a lifetime ago, but it was only a couple of months. Dazibao had a not half bad exhibit featuring the work of John Duncan , Nestor Kruger , Erwin Wurm , Daniel von Sturmer , and Amon Yariv . Now that time has settled in I can only honestly remember the work of John Duncan, and Daniel von Sturmer. Mr. Duncan's was photographs of a bunch of shipping palates arranged in the Irish countryside. Nice simple one joke sorta stuff, see 'em, smile, and move on. Mr. von Sturmer's work was what made the show memorable. Two videos synchronized and then rotated 90 degrees so that the objects in the video appeared to be sliding along the floor, when in fact they were in a box being tilted. Bright and colorful standard household objects, against a plain white background it was a simple and effective way of disconnecting what you were seeing with your standard issue ideas of gravity and how it works. Although now that I look into hos work it appears that we got a crippled version of screen test, as on Mr. von Sturmer's website it states "4 Screen video installation and Kinetic object" and I only saw a two-channel video at Dazibao. I wonder how Susan Edelstein's article in Prefix Photo posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 20.5.07 links to this post I don't normally read Walrus magazine , mostly because way too much of it is money-walled. But I came across an article written by Adam Gopnik about (ostensibly) the current state of affairs in the museum biz. In a nutshell, he uses alliteration to try to show how museums have moved from being mausoleums, to machines, to maybe malls but mostly mindful. Mr. Gopnik, can I introduce you to Paul Werner ? One of the major problems with Mr. Gopnik's thesis, is that he does not even acknowledge the explosion of museums here, there and everywhere. In New Zealand there is approximately one museum for every 8,000 residents . In Canada there are more than 2,500 museums . Mr Gopnik probably would think that the Groupe Bizot is too large, and really should be reduced to only including museums in New York, Paris and London. The idea all museums are in lock step, thinking and moving to the same beat in the same direction is about as preposterous as a mustache on the Mona Lisa . Then, when he writes " One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that art, which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. " I really get annoyed. That he furthers the cliche that contemporary art is incomprehensible is just flat out stupid. Try that sentence this way: One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that literature , which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. or if you prefer One of the central comedies of manners in our society is that that film , which none of us quite understands, is taken out of the aesthetic context in which it's made and brought to institutions. Film is understandable, as is literature. When either, or both get tossed into an institution (say a university) it is the duty of the institution to elevate whatever is being brought in. One easy way to elevate something is through use of three syllable words, or academic language if you prefer. When and where did museums become like universities? I think it is much more helpful to consider museums like concert halls for music. Or libraries for books. Given that there are two museums here in town that regularly schedule concerts ( one , two posted by Zeke's, the Montreal Art Gallery on 20.5.07 links to this post Last week I was tagged by my friend Edith Rey of doreyme .

Oil in her hands moves across canvas as easily as sunlight through a summer afternoon, and nature and the color wheel might compete to claim its colors for their own. Oil washes take on the fluid texture of watercolor and the freehand curves of ink on paper. She achieves much the same effects in watercolor, on sheets up to a meter in height, while her paintings over the years have approached calligraphy. They are also ambitious paintings, which were at Lennon Weinberg through February 15 (and my apologies for posting late), in all-over compositions that can easily fill a canvas and a wall. Joan Mitchell might have achieved them had she absorbed the lessons of Chinese art and dance. Lyrical abstraction is not often a compliment. It long identified Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler , Howardena Pindell and Alma Thomas (to name two examples of African American abstraction), and, sure, a few men (like Sam Francis and Beauford Delaney) with girlie stuff. It stood for continuing Abstraction Expressionism after Minimalism had shown that abstraction should be made of sterner stuff, and indeed widely praised new paintings by Larry Poons at Danese/Corey , through February 8, left me cold. Meyers last two solo shows got raves from publications as conservative as The New Criterion and The Wall Street Journal . John Yau, as sane as ever, felt compelled to insist that her joys have entered into a real that is disjunctive to the point of jarring. It components had begun not just to dance but to jump. I have taken Meyer for granted myself, but I think I may finally be getting it. One can see the jumps as a lack of disjunction, with each calligraphic trace and color in its cell running up against and slightly into others. Meyer can thus play fast and loose with the grid, while making its rigor her own. She can also draw on calligraphy to move between color and works on paper in black and white, as if taking stock of her own strengthsâand as a reminder of how painting and drawing can still feed one another. Her evolution has meant simplification as well, in a marvelous paring away of expressionisms muss and fuss. She also cites as inspiration Art Brut in France, like Jean Dubuffet, but simple does not have to be simpleminded. Meyer has been exhibiting since the 1970s. Some twenty years ago, her broader color fields ran over one another, including greens close to Mitchells. They were more obviously expressive, but also more static. Before that, Meyers work included thicker textures and hints of still-life. Maybe the excitement of the simple is most evident now in the largest and freest work, in the back room, with the choice between primaries on one wall and blacks against purples over white and yellow on another. Lyrics can be pretty disjunctive anyway, and she can cite in Bob Dylan to prove it. Another tribute to women in abstraction comes with a two-site display in honor of Moira Dryer , just closing yesterday, February 22. One room, at Eleven Rivington , has work from shortly before Dryers death in 1982. It includes large monochromes in acrylic on wood with a thin but heavily worked texture, somewhere between washes and burning. It also includes work in acrylic and casein that exposes the support as if seen from behindâor exposes the materials for what they are, with warping and brocade as if stitched together. These apparent opposites have in common a formalists twin demands for pure painting and for art as object. They also soften those demands through muter tones and more palpable objects, refusing either obvious expression or the grid. Around the corner, the gallerys second space picks up on those variations on a theme with younger artists. Mika Tajima, for example, has the weathered monochrome on fabric and wood, Jeffrey Tranchell the bare stretcher. Mary Weatherford lets stained canvas hang loose beneath neon, and Julia Dault frees it from the wall with her own recourse to artificial leather. The choices seem arbitraryâor just self-consciously Lower East Side currents. Noam Rappaports angled one-color rectangles, each with its own stretcher, owe way more to Ellsworth Kelly or Ted Stamm, and Jackie Saccoccio just plain paints exuberantly and well. Maybe all that matters is that at last no one is apologizing.

A self-portrait shows him kneeling in profile, barely within the frame, sleeves rolled up and ready to go. One may not spot right away his bulky camera, not when its shadow fills the bright scrim behind him with a more alluring image. Steichen had a job to do, and it involved the tools of his trade, high style, and illusion. So, of course, does the glossy magazine business, and Steichen had been chief photographer for CondÃ© Nast since 1923. Any self-portrait is a doubling, but Steichen photographed himself much as he would treat Maurice Chevalier, using multiple light sources to give the entertainer a pair of whirling shadows. Chevalier might be singing to the audience while dancing with himself. For Steichen artists, too, had style, like Charles Sheeler with his hands in his pockets, ever so dapper and casual. Eugene ONeill adopts a pose and a sullen glance that would do his leading actors proud. His wife, Carlotta, who had herself held the stage, shows not a trace of her encroaching madness. Edward Steichen in the 1920s and 1930s , through February 23, shows off a gift to the Whitney of his work for Vanity Fair and Vogue , where he remained until 1937. Those years have already him earned a book and a much larger show at the International Center of Photography, in 2009, but they benefit from the intimacy of the museums first-floor gallery. One can get to know Mr. Sandburg (Carl, to you) and his wife at home and Jacob Epstein, the British sculptor. Endless Column by Constantin Brancusi rises like a ghost from behind a fence, within the photographers own garden. Steichens daughter resembles a stage character, perhaps Ophelia, a device that Juliet Margaret Cameron favored sixty years before. Steichen is within his circle, but it is the world of stage and screen all the same. His commercial photos recall early Modernism, but as theater. An apple, warts and all, on the curved outline of a table could be a subject for Paul Strand . Its title, An Apple, a Boulder, a Mountain, France , shouts its loyalty to the still-lifes and mountains of Paul CÃ©zanne . Yet it also speaks of playing a part. Foxgloves have the spare beauty of flowers for Georgia OKeeffe and an old-fashioned precision. Yet instead of OKeeffe, as sitter for Alfred Stieglitz , one has Marlene Dietrich, the Teuton siren. Steichen was always the most atmospheric and traditional of American modernists, always in love with shadow. It all but consumes Thomas Mann, and it gives a writer like H. G. Wells and a public figure like Winston Churchill, both seated, much the same bulk and dignity. If a performer did look sufficiently serious, Steichen is happy to help. He presents Charlie Chaplin not as the tramp of comedy, but in a suitâand divides him vertically with light and darkness like a map of the unconscious. Steichen also gives actors an assist by encouraging them to improvise while in character. Lynne Fontaine steps out of Os Strange Interlude just long enough to frame a mournful child. Nothing is beneath him, including advertising, and here, too, sophistication is the name of the game. A lipstick ad slips in a man among a womans multiple reflections, because even a make-up mirror holds more desires than one knew. Rows of silverware against a black surface approach a mathematical composition, Churchill fronts a demand to repeal prohibition, and a nude promotes Cannon Towels. Did she have a stain that nothing else could remove? In an ad for a hospital, people line a two-tiered stairwell, like immigrants at Ellis Island for Lewis Hines. Are those hungry masses yearning simply to breathe? One should not think of these photographs as acts of subversion, akin to the confrontation of Madison Avenue and Surrealism for Alfred Gescheidt (and I have placed them together as a longer review and my latest upload ). They are acts of revelation. They flatter a magazines readers by taking them behind the scenes. They are also creative acts, for a photographer working his own way through convention. One of the first photos, of a modern dancers ecstasy on the Acropolis, is also among the hokiest. Maybe Steichen never does get over the idea of art as a mad ritual, but he can start to place himself in the company of the new.

Jeff Landman stages his own archaeological dig, at Tracy Williams through February 22, spanning millennia. And you know what? It looks surprisingly modern. The archaeology started with his discovery of the remains of a barn in Pennsylvania. From its timbers, he packs a gallery tightly with constructions in blond wood. They both shape and populate the space, as installation and as human habitation. They tempt one alternately to admire them and to make them ones own. One notices the change coming off the elevator, where a partition presents an obstacle to movement and to vision, and it is not the last. Within, a white curtain defines a chamber for just a few small beams low to the ground. Could they be all that is left from bedroom furniture or from a room itself? Outside this architecture within the architecture, the room becomes more spacious and familiar. Even opening crowds could move freely among smooth tables, freestanding columns, and stiff-back chairs arranged neatly in rows. For once, too, they had a place to sit, and they did not hesitate to take advantage. Maybe no one dared leave a wine glass on either table, but they did throw backpacks in a corner on the floor. They may not have noticed the regimentation of paired and unpaired chairs, only rarely face to face. The work loses its strangeness as furniture only by becoming Minimalist sculpture. Twentieth-century geometry also helps govern the symmetrical cuts into beams stacked in pairs in the smaller room by the window, but then so do ancient cultures. Landman cites as influences Mesopotamian and early Christian architecture, along with the Viennese school. Others might think, too, of Neolithic monuments in his native England, along perhaps with Dan Graham , Isamu Noguchi , and Ursula Von Rydingsvard . Maybe future archaeologists will have other things on their mind, as at the end of Planet of the Apes . In Chelsea alone, they might care more about the wine bar on the High Line . In turn, artists have fabricated their share of cultural debris, like Liz Glynn with a heavy hand at Paula Cooper through February 8, in papier-mÃ¢chÃ© clothing, and an anchor. Liz Magic Laser, too, has played with the politics of art openings as social events, and Andrea Zittel has staged her Post-Minimalist fallout shelters. They all see contemporary culture as inherently recycled, and they are not always sure whether to celebrate it or destroy it. From that point of view, Landman could be settling for cleaning it up. He seeks the construction of a lightness, a special cleanliness, along with a corresponding weight, and the results can look a little too clean. Merely to move so freely among cultures and millennia washes away differences. Landman thinks of uncovering not just civilizations, but a transcendent experience. If that stack by the window could better serve as a funeral pyre or for human sacrifice, he is not saying. Still he has room for loose ends. A single timber stands at an unsteady angle, still rough, as another layer of timeâand a long table has a single chair, like a conference for one. Landman derives a heightened awareness and even comedy from the conflict of cultures. He also works on a human scaleâand not just with home furnishings almost ready for Ikea. The beams beg to be described as the length of a forearm and the width of an outstretched hand. The pyre is just about waist high. More and more artists are working between Minimalism and the present , as well as between art and architecture . From the smooth outlines of his sculpture, Landman finds a less cynical deconstructive architecture , with space for visitors.

Maybe it has turned the northeast corridor into an extended traffic jam. Maybe it has gutted a Detroit on the verge of bankruptcyâor of losing its art museum . Maybe it means cookie-cutter dreams of luxury and the institutionalization of bad taste. Who knew, though, that the greater New York area, south Florida, or LA had grown so large? Who knew that sprawltown now extends to Bangkok? Martin Adolfsson calls it Suburbia Gone Wild , the title of a book (and a pop-up exhibition last summer at 109 Norfolk Street). Many times I had the distinct feeling that I was witnessing an entire social class going through a turbulent period akin to teenage angst. Yet his photographs are more striking for their utter lack of wildness (in striking contrast to another challenge to both commercial and art photography, by Alfred Gescheidt ). Not only are they both ever so familiar and empty of people. They are also a deliberate taming of the picturesque, for that vision of grandeur as domesticity held out in the style section of The New York Times . If globalization for Thomas L. Friedman promises that the world is flat, these are its flatlands. Adolfsson first saw them unexpectedly from the sky, on a trip to Bangkok, and he knew that he had to return. He also knew that they could not be unique, and he soon found himself hunting out planned communities in Shanghai, Bangalore, Cairo, Moscow, Johannesburg, SÃ£o Paulo, and Mexico City as well. He and a woman posed as a couple and as potential buyers, rather than asking permission. His book boasts of forty-four suburbs, eight countries, five continents, twenty-six hundred photographs, and six years. One might never know it. The developers do their best to ensure that, with much the same Spanish-style ceramic roofing, central swimming pools, model kitchens, and flat-panel TVs everywhere. So, for that matter, does the photographer, born in Sweden and now based in New York, with quite a body of commercial work. The book pairs almost identical scenes in distant cities, right down to twin beds for the kiddies. He finds few particulars beyond their stuffed animalsâand few bows to existing cultures beyond the red logo, perhaps a dragon, at the bottom of a pool. He also accentuates the regularity and symmetry, whether in shots of identical row houses or, more often, in single mansions. Somehow, despite having shot all these on the sly, he reproduces perfectly the style of travel and architecture magazines. One could find oneself at home in the United States, right down to a framed picture of Secretary of State John Kerry. Of course, that is the point. One should find a disjunction between appearances and reality, and one should find that disturbing. I am not entirely convinced, though, that one can. I admire the sheer magnitude of the project, and I am surprised that Adolfsson does not have a wider audience. Yet appearances have absorbed even him. This is not suburbia for Amy Bennett as voyeur and comedian , Jeff Wall as perpetual tourist, Gregory Crewdson as a futurist, Terry Evans as a mapper of the human and natural landscape, or Thomas Demand as an illusion. For its sole furtive break in the cleanliness, it shoots household cleaners like Spic n Span. That leaves open the question of what it has found. Joseph Grima, in his preface to the limited edition (published by Visual Structures), describes it as new wealth, Tina Essmaker in her text as model homes in emerging economies. One might never know that these countries already had concentrations of wealth and poverty. One might never know how other classes have seized on and in turn influenced the American way of lifeor that Adolfsson would never have pulled off his deception without the expectation that everyone carries a mobile camera nowadays. One might never know that the most wrenching shifts, especially in China, are coming from forced displacement into crowded and polluted cities, and one might never know that the upper class has repopulated American cities, while ordinary people have long felt the limits of suburbia. Suburbia Gone Wild tells a terrific story, but it will take others to tease out its complexities and its strangeness.

So, too, do the films of Isaac Julien , and (along with more on Julien and the art of globalization) they are the subject of a longer review, in my latest upload . A woman looks through a pristine window, from behind a conference table, on the dark night of a citys soul. A man leans into the strange geometry of a more opaque and colorful round window, from behind and in silhouette, as if a clock tower had recovered beauty by losing time. He also stands alone in an icy landscape, wrapped in a dark coat and volcanic mists. These ever so stylish stills accompany Playtime , which ran at Metro Pictures through December 14, its only actors labeled the Collector, the Houseworker, the Artist, the Auctioneer, and the Reporter. One might just as well save a little breath and say the Assholes and the Victims. The Auctioneer, in a black suit and a hipsters touch of a beard, walks briskly without missing a breath or mussing his swept-up hair. The inestimable value of his art, he explains, will confirm the inestimable value of your life. He makes no effort to disguise either his pandering or his disdain. Neither does Julien. It is only an auctioneer, quipped Oscar Wilde, who can equally and impartially admire all schools of art. Well, no, for apparently only an auctioneer can admire unequally and partially the lucky few. The films as Julien calls them, are informed by David Harvey, the Marxist scholar of postmodernism and capital. (He has also filmed himself and Harvey speaking at another bastion of art and privilege, the Hayward Gallery in London.) In others, a Filipino maid describes her isolation in Dubai, while well-oiled sheiks slip past in a slow-motion blur, and a photographer travels to Reykjavik, ostensibly to locate the roots of the global financial crisis. One may recognize the two from the still photographs, although one may have trouble making out her accent or his purpose. No matter, not when she can stand on rippling desert sand and he can play a figure out of Caspar David Friedrich and Northern Romanticism . This particular critique of capitalism has a way of erasing differences, along with the blood on anyones hands. If seventy minutes of this on a wide screen sounds unendurable, a three-minute version played on seventeen screens in Times Square every night in December, starting three minutes before midnight. (Symbolism duly noted.) Nine monitors suffice for Ten Thousand Waves , at MoMA through February 17, which commemorates another sacrifice to global capitalismâthe drowning of twenty Chinese cockle pickers off the coast of England in 2004. (What are cockle pickers? If you have to ask, you cant afford to profit from one.) Julien has even hired a noted orchestra and commissioned a classical score. The scene sweeps across the globe, from echoes of an idyllic Chinese landscape through the highway to a congested city. Along the way, a Chinese calligrapher exercises his craft, before a window washer spreads the letters into a black stain on the way to wiping them away. A woman in white floats overhead, representing a sea goddess responsible for guiding fishermen to safety. The job is just so much harder these days. And no question but the 2010 work tames the museums outsize atrium as never before, whether crossing far above or exploiting, for once, the vantage points on higher floors. Yet the overwhelming slickness remains. As a black, gay man in London, one who has filmed the Trinidad community in Baltimore , Julien surely knows exclusion, but his style is dressed for success. It has its obvious heroes and villains, and they look equally handsome. The rich are different from you and me, and so here are the poor and the creative artist.

First, though, with Angelina Gualdoni , one has to let go. One may hate to give up seeing them as abstractions, in which oil and acrylic can take on rough glow of enamel. (No, she is hardly Jackson Pollock , but then who is?) Gualdoni appeared in Pour last spring at the same gallery, and her stains spread outward from the center of a canvas. And then a brushstroke or a spatter may land on top of that. One may want to hold onto the bare spots, the incomplete edges, the awkward vagueness, and the loose compositions suggestive of an unfinished painting. Gualdoni also appeared in The Trace of a Trace of a Trace in 2006, and who after Postmodernism does not expect reality to remain at a third remove? Speaking just for myself, though, I most wanted to see her interiors as cross-hatching after Jasper Johns . The motif may serve as wallpaper, tiling, a tabletop, the base of a window, or nothing obvious at all. As with Johns, it often appears in thin bright lines on white, but it can also deepen into darker traces against deep violet, almost like Johns in encaustic . It never once fills a canvas, and it does not coincide with the picture plane, but it can still drive the rest of a painting into depth. That drive, of course, is realism, as is the identification of color with light. Gualdonis series depicts a plant on a table or ledge, either outdoors or in front of a window. In the interiors, the window is the only source of light. Her morning and afternoon sunlight can wash out the background entirely, leaving a tangled silhouette. It can also sink much of the room in shadow, which then gathers more color. Painting cannot get more realistic than thatâor more abstract. Mike Childs , too, works with cross-hatching, just recently at Robert Henry Contemporary through February 2. He treats it not as a subject in itself, as in all-over painting, but as what his show calls Structural Tendencies . The tendencies include broad areas of bright but flat color, with hard edges but unfamiliar geometry. They also include irregular diamond patterns in gray or more muted colors. Rather than Johns, they may recall Terry Winters , but without the fuss or the science fiction. Think of Winters for a crisper, simpler today. Like Winters, he is not above illusion. Where Gualdoni is among the many these days working between realism and abstraction , Childs sticks to abstraction, but with its own broken borders. Rather than a flat surface set against a deeper space, his grid is a window onto depth. Or make that a window onto windows. His cells may curve, like fragments of a buckyball , or bounce around in the picture plane. They may also have thick edges, like old TV sets , with additional shades of color or gray within. The contrasts keep one looking, only partly to decipher the imagined architecture. Maybe Peter Halley will come shopping for storm windows for his postmodern prisons . Others, though, will relish the shifting colors and scales in two dimensions, like an orange field rolling in from the left. The shifts may well depend on scale. Works on paper in black and white look great online, on the same full screen as a canvas, but do not hold up as well in the gallery. The paintings, in contrast, keep on tending toward structure.
