The History of the Universe This site is dedicated to the memory of Sir Patrick Moore Follow @Digibites space art by arthur woods Welcome to the new ars astronautica website . Screenshot of previous ars astronautica website. For those of you familiar with the previous ars astronautica website you will find that I have changed the design and the focus of ars astronautica to be more about documenting my own activities in the field of space art. However, I hope you won't be disappointed because much of the previous information has been updated and can be still found on this new website. I am still very dedicated to documenting the expanding field of space art and especially that of the astronautical arts. I hope you will find the information about my work and the work of other artists mentioned on this website to be both useful and inspiring. I plan to publish a regular about new developments in the field of space art as I believe the time for a new space age has arrived. Our current civilization has reached the carrying capacity of the planet and will soon need to turn to extraterrestrial resources to meet the human needs on Earth. Space artists will have a major role to play as this development unfolds. Please note that - which is currently mapped onto the arsastronautica.com URL will be developed separately at some point in the near future.
