We also have some works of European artists. In addition to offering works of art for sale, we also offer appraisal services and restoration services. We are always looking to purchase and exhibit quality works of art. On Approval Agreement: Â Â Â Â  Bantam Fine Arts allows its clients to try fine art works on approval in their homes.Â  I do not expect people to buy fine art from seeing images.Â  Because of the fragile nature of fine art and the risks involved in transporting or shipping fine art work, I ask that you try fine art works only if you are seriously considering a purchase.Â  My policy for an on approval agreement is as follows: Â Â Â Â  Before a fine art work is shipped the art gallery requires a check for the full amount of the art.Â  The gallery will pay for the shipping and insurance.Â  Once the art arrives at your home you will have 5 days to make your decision.Â  If you decide to keep the art I expect you to either phone (860)567-3337 or E-mail me . Â Â Â Â  If you decide not to keep the art the gallery requests that you will pay for the shipping and insurance for its return.Â  When the art is returned to Bantam Fine Arts in undamaged condition I will then return your check.
