A Brief Delay At The Wall by John Buxton Posted February 25th, 2014 A Great Example of Art Speak Art Speak, A way by which complex sounding words and concepts are used to create the illusion of something being more then it is as a method to create value, meaning and importance that drastically outweighs what is actually there. Sothebys Contemporary Department said that Cy Twomblys epic 1964 canvas Untitled (Rome) is one of the highlights of our Contemporary Art Evening Auction on 12 February 2014. But what is even more amusing is the video created about the piece for the sale. If one looks at it objectively we can see that the painting really looks like the type of doodling that many peoples two year old children do. At one point the video flashes to a scribble with pencil and says it shows the artists growing confidence. Evidently there are many in the art world who think adults scribbling like children is something people should be willing to pay big bucks for. Although the piece does look like one a child would do, this doodle sold for 12,178,500 British pounds, over 20,000,000 US dollars. Click here to view this incredible example of art speak. Everything about it from the word choice to the British accent to the dramatic music oozes value, when really the work is nothing but scribbles. This concept was also explored in Frederick C. Rosss new speech, titled Why Realism? To read the speech, click here . Posted February 21st, 2014 The Academy of Realist Art, Boston Scholarship Competition The Academy of Realist Art, Boston announces its second annual scholarship competition for promising artists with a love for the academic style of painting and drawing.

ARC has just published a speech titled Why Realism? given by ARC Chairman, Frederick C. Ross, on February 7, 2014 at the University of Connecticut. This was given as the Keynote Address to the Connecticut Society of Portrait Artists. Thinking about this theme, Ive concluded that nothing could be more appropriate than to ask and answer this question: Why Realism? There are finally today many organizations that believe in the value and importance of realism, both classical and contemporary; but why Realism ? Why, after a century of denigration, repression and near annihilation, when the accepted beliefs taught in nearly every high school, college and university for the last hundred years, has been that realism is unoriginal?â¦ My answer is direct, simple and should be self-evident: The visual fine arts of drawing, painting and sculpture are best understood first last and always as a language; a visual language. It was developed and preserved first and foremost as a means of communication very much like spoken and written languages. And like language it is successful if communication takes place and it is unsuccessful if it does not. This answer simultaneously defines the term Fine Art. So fine art is a way that human beings can communicate . To read the full speech, click here .

Posted February 6th, 2014 New Article William Bouguereaus âVirgin of the Liliesâ? versus âMadonna of the Rosesâ? was recently published in the Epoch Times. La Vierge Aux Lys La Madone aux Roses Although William Bouguereau (1825â1905), painted the Madonna and Child several times throughout his career, there are two versions that draw an interesting comparison to one another as they are similar in many ways but hold interesting symbolic differences as well. The first is âLa Vierge aux Lysâ? painted in 1899 and the second is âLa Madone aux Roses,â? in 1903. Both are three quarters length and show only the mother and child with no additional figures.

Jack Rosenberg award-winning artist and guest instructor will be teaching two one-week sessions May 26- 30, and June 2 â 6, 2013. The course would be considered an advanced oil painting class.

Self Portrait by Anders Zorn Posted January 23rd, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part II of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. Why, at this time in our history, is there a move away from non-objective art toward realism? There is a strong move towards realism because people are tired of looking at things that do not require skill. I am sure that in the beginning and even into the 1960s and 1970s, it was exciting to experiment by throwing paint or painting dots and squares, finding found objects and putting them on pedestals, but now, that type of art is just dated. It is not representative of the 21st century. I read an article not too long ago in Times Magazine that was an interview with Damien Hurst. He was talking about a series of paintings he was working on that was the largest collection of paintings of spots ever created. Furthermore he went on to say that he only painted a small portion of them and hired other people to paint the vast majority. When the reporter asked him who he found to help him with the work, he said he tried to find people with no artistic talent to show that anyone can produce this type of art. I could not help thinking, ât you embarrassed to say that you are selling paintings created by people who you admit yourself have no artistic talent?â? So people can paint spots, so what. The only amazing thing about it is that people are still being duped into spending tens of thousands of dollars on things they can produce themselves in a couple hours.

Posted January 20th, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part I of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. How would you summarize the ARC philosophy? I would say that the main core of the ARC philosophy is that the definition of art has been over expanded to the point where the word has lost its integrity. When any object can be placed on a pedestal and called art, when anything is art, then nothing is art. Anytime you have a definition that expands to encompass everything, then it ceases to have meaning. An Offering by Frank Dicksee The ARC philosophy does its best to define what art is. There is of course a difference between craft, decorative art, fine art, and good and bad art, and places of grey where it is perhaps hard to draw the line. This of course makes some people angry. They tend to say things like who are you to say what is or is not art but if not us then who? We have stepped forward with scholars and experts, to try and bring respect back to the word and create a sensible type of definition, broad as it may be. Someone had to be the first to publicly state that the emperor has no cloths. Shark parts in formaldehyde are not art, they are at best an educational science tool; statues of the Virgin Mary made out of cow manure is not art, they are just disgusting; putting bags of trash in the center of a museum and calling it installation art, does not make it art, they are still bags of trash. It is like trying to call an apple an orange; just because you say it is, doesnt make it true. Art is an integral part of every culture, having the power to shape nations and civilizations; the word art is something that should be respected, not just given frivolously. We focus on realism because it is the universal language and the only form capable of expressing and communicating without words the depth of mankinds experiences.

Tiffany - Autumn, 1923-24 Art History Spotlight 10 Guess the Artist Monday November 5, 2012 The artist worked as a manuscript illuminator and panel painter during the Early Italian Renaissance. Giorgio Vasari, fount of suspect information, claimed the artist trained under a person who was beatified by Pope John Paul II centuries later. In reality, there is no documentation supporting Vasari's claim (I know! Try to recover from your shock!), but our artist clearly admired the future Blessed's work. The artist came from a Florentine family that constantly battled with the Medici clan over who had the most wealth and power. At various times, over the course of 100 years or so, both parties sent rivaling family leaders (an ever-evolving cast of characters) into exile. When both leaders were in Florence, they competed to build the most imposing palazzo -- the artist's family won, by the way, which incited yet another de' Medici to confiscate their palazzo and not return ownership for 30 years. Naturally, all concerned kept marrying their daughters off to the other family thanks to the "friends close, enemies closer" philosophy. This work is one of 17 illuminations the artist created for a Book of Hours commissioned by a third Florentine family. They were not nobility, but kept marrying up and acquiring more money by any means necessary. Wealthy, though not nearly as wealthy as the other two, they were known around town for acting like flashy nouveau riche types. This tribe also had a tendency to pick feuds with just about anybody over anything. The list of people they alienated in the late 13th- and early 14th-centuries includes the Guelphs, the Ghibellines and the Neri, as well as Dante Alighieri, who slammed them in the seventeenth canto of the "Paradise" portion of his Divine Comedy email me Last Week's Answer: set of clues didn't seem that easy, but nearly everyone knew that it was Picasso and his Mama.

Carved in semi-hardwood with glass eyes (one broken), it has miscellaneous repairs and most of its original finish is intact. The mask has been well used and its back (link below) has a rich, dark patina more common to old Guatemalan masks than Mexican ones. The fit is extremely comfortable for a variety of facial shapes. To a collector, the back of a mask is sometimes more important than the front. An authentic, old patina on the back is a testimony to the mask's use in its rightful context. The piece at the left is authentic but with many masks commonly encountered in the marketplace and through dealers, clever techniques have been used by artisan-carvers to create a false patina intended to make the mask seem older or more valuable than it really is. False wear marks, deliberate abuse and subsequent repairs are also used in this crafty craft. Age: Approx. 100 years. See also: .

In spite of a happy ending, the tiring fandango has no real utility other than to mock a bevy of little old men, all dancing - or better to say hobbling - with feeble knees and canes while simultaneously making lecherous fools of themselves. I'm not a whistleblower but I can't understand why the elderly and the handicapped - true victims of this cruel pageant - have not uttered a single word of protest up to now; perhaps they're just too intimidated by the dance's widespread popularity to complain; thus the Baile de los Viejitos continues in its long-standing tradition as a cute and endearing icon of Mexican culture.

If you have stumbled across this exhibition by accident and your time is limited, it is suggested you look at either the 2008 Additions and Comment under Gallery Links for regular updates, or the American 1 Gallery for the kind of information included about artists and sitters. Other sections contain information on the history of portrait miniatures and Internet links to related sites. The site is continually being revised as extra information or miniatures come to hand. Such revisions are a great advantage of publishing on the Internet. If you wish to ask me about miniatures, you can click on my photo for an email link. Please, please, please! However, before you set off to explore the site, a heartfelt plea to anyone who owns a miniature and knows the identity of the subject. Please, please, record the name of the sitter, either written on the reverse or on an attached tag, especially if you are contemplating a sale of the miniature. Some sellers deliberately conceal or remove the identity of the sitter, probably because they are ashamed of selling an "ancestor". The miniature here by Annie Dixon, of a girl with ringlets, falls into this category. When purchased, it was found the sitter's name is written on the reverse, but has been crossed out so it is illegible. It is far better to be as proud of the sitter's identity, as the original owner of the miniature was, so that an ancestor's identity is not lost and can follows them into the future. I think that to remove the identity of a sitter is akin to removing the sitter's gravestone from their grave. No one would contemplate that. In this collection, research into named sitters has often revealed how interesting their lives were. Shown here is one large painting (20" x 16") in the collection, which was an irresistible purchase. It is titled "The Miniature" and is signed by A L Grace, a late Victorian artist. It depicts a collector (not me, I have more hair) admiring a portrait and gives an indication of the relative size of a miniature, although most are smaller than this. Collecting Miniatures The fascination in collecting miniatures arises from the skill of the artist, with each portrait being a unique and original work of art, together with the opportunity to research individual sitters and the historical events associated with them. As with collecting of any nature, there is also the thrill of the hunt! Some notes for potential collectors. An author on the subject, Daphne Foskett, observed in her book "Miniatures - Dictionary and Guide" that there are two methods of forming a collection, with the choice between the two determined by how much the collector can afford to spend. The first method is for collectors of limited means. In Daphne Foskett's opinion this is the most interesting way and involves the collector buying any miniatures that appeal. In this way a collection may be assembled that may not be of equal merit, but can later be weeded out and the collection improved. In the process the collector gradually gains knowledge, becomes more discriminating and thus better able to select good examples. For example the collector will quickly become aware that miniatures can be divided into two types. Collectors generally prefer those which are true portraits, but some people do collect miniatures which were originally mass produced for decorative purposes. The second method of collecting is for a collector with ample means who can afford to buy important items recommended by specialist dealers. Such a collection is often smaller, but will include examples by the better known artists. An extreme example is the Starr Collection of miniatures by John Smart, which contains a dated example for each year of his activity from 1760 to 1810. As the cost of a John Smart miniature these days is in the range of US$20,000 to US$40,000, a collector wishing to emulate that collection will need very ample means! Most miniature portraits are, as the name suggests, portraits of people. However, it is possible to occasionally find the skill of an artist demonstrated in other ways, such as the feather shown here, which is painted by an unknown artist. Prices for Miniatures The current world record price for a miniature portrait is over US$1,300,000 which was paid for a miniature of George Washington by John Ramage. At the time it was probably the most expensive painting per square inch in the world. However, a collector need not be disheartened by that price. Miniatures do represent an opportunity to assemble a collection of original art at modest cost. This collection has been acquired on a limited budget. Thus famous miniature painters such as Hilliard, Cooper, Smart, and Engleheart are absent. Nevertheless, by putting in much search and research time, together with some calculated risk taking and occasional lucky finds, it has been possible to assemble a range of good artists. Some of these, such as Francois Soiron, Domenico Bossi, James Peale, and Charles Bourgeois are the equals of top British artists and represented in museum collections around the world. Potential collectors may also be heartened to know that shown here is the cheapest miniature in this collection which was purchased in 2001 at auction for less than US$5. Also shown is the signed and dated note found inside it, which gives the name of both the artist and the sitter. (As a word of caution, miniatures should only be opened if they come apart easily. If not, seek the assistance of a jeweller.) Thus bargains can still be found. Overall the average cost of this collection is under US$500 per miniature. This average cost limit is an ongoing target, so as to have fun collecting, and as a purchasing discipline. Research One of the most enjoyable features of collecting is researching sitters. It is often amazing what can be found out about a sitter who may have an unfamiliar name, but may well be related to famous people from history. Rarely, it is even possible to use other sources to identify an unknown sitter. The extra information can add dramatically to the value.

What does provenance mean? From the French word provenir, which means "to come from," provenance is the history of ownership of a valued object, such as a work of art. A full provenance provides a documented history that can help prove ownership, assign the work to a known artist, and establish the work of art's authenticity. See an example of how the Provenance Index was used to trace the ownership of Peter Paul Rubens's The Entombment after it was purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum.
