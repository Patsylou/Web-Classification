A Brief Delay At The Wall by John Buxton Posted February 25th, 2014 A Great Example of Art Speak Art Speak, A way by which complex sounding words and concepts are used to create the illusion of something being more then it is as a method to create value, meaning and importance that drastically outweighs what is actually there. Sothebys Contemporary Department said that Cy Twomblys epic 1964 canvas Untitled (Rome) is one of the highlights of our Contemporary Art Evening Auction on 12 February 2014. But what is even more amusing is the video created about the piece for the sale. If one looks at it objectively we can see that the painting really looks like the type of doodling that many peoples two year old children do. At one point the video flashes to a scribble with pencil and says it shows the artists growing confidence. Evidently there are many in the art world who think adults scribbling like children is something people should be willing to pay big bucks for. Although the piece does look like one a child would do, this doodle sold for 12,178,500 British pounds, over 20,000,000 US dollars. Click here to view this incredible example of art speak. Everything about it from the word choice to the British accent to the dramatic music oozes value, when really the work is nothing but scribbles. This concept was also explored in Frederick C. Rosss new speech, titled Why Realism? To read the speech, click here .

ARC has just published a speech titled Why Realism? given by ARC Chairman, Frederick C. Ross, on February 7, 2014 at the University of Connecticut. This was given as the Keynote Address to the Connecticut Society of Portrait Artists. Thinking about this theme, Ive concluded that nothing could be more appropriate than to ask and answer this question: Why Realism? There are finally today many organizations that believe in the value and importance of realism, both classical and contemporary; but why Realism ? Why, after a century of denigration, repression and near annihilation, when the accepted beliefs taught in nearly every high school, college and university for the last hundred years, has been that realism is unoriginal?âŚ My answer is direct, simple and should be self-evident: The visual fine arts of drawing, painting and sculpture are best understood first last and always as a language; a visual language. It was developed and preserved first and foremost as a means of communication very much like spoken and written languages. And like language it is successful if communication takes place and it is unsuccessful if it does not. This answer simultaneously defines the term Fine Art. So fine art is a way that human beings can communicate . To read the full speech, click here .

Posted February 6th, 2014 New Article William Bouguereaus âVirgin of the Liliesâ? versus âMadonna of the Rosesâ? was recently published in the Epoch Times. La Vierge Aux Lys La Madone aux Roses Although William Bouguereau (1825â1905), painted the Madonna and Child several times throughout his career, there are two versions that draw an interesting comparison to one another as they are similar in many ways but hold interesting symbolic differences as well. The first is âLa Vierge aux Lysâ? painted in 1899 and the second is âLa Madone aux Roses,â? in 1903. Both are three quarters length and show only the mother and child with no additional figures.

Self Portrait by Anders Zorn Posted January 23rd, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part II of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. Why, at this time in our history, is there a move away from non-objective art toward realism? There is a strong move towards realism because people are tired of looking at things that do not require skill. I am sure that in the beginning and even into the 1960s and 1970s, it was exciting to experiment by throwing paint or painting dots and squares, finding found objects and putting them on pedestals, but now, that type of art is just dated. It is not representative of the 21st century. I read an article not too long ago in Times Magazine that was an interview with Damien Hurst. He was talking about a series of paintings he was working on that was the largest collection of paintings of spots ever created. Furthermore he went on to say that he only painted a small portion of them and hired other people to paint the vast majority. When the reporter asked him who he found to help him with the work, he said he tried to find people with no artistic talent to show that anyone can produce this type of art. I could not help thinking, ât you embarrassed to say that you are selling paintings created by people who you admit yourself have no artistic talent?â? So people can paint spots, so what. The only amazing thing about it is that people are still being duped into spending tens of thousands of dollars on things they can produce themselves in a couple hours.

Posted January 20th, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part I of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. How would you summarize the ARC philosophy? I would say that the main core of the ARC philosophy is that the definition of art has been over expanded to the point where the word has lost its integrity. When any object can be placed on a pedestal and called art, when anything is art, then nothing is art. Anytime you have a definition that expands to encompass everything, then it ceases to have meaning. An Offering by Frank Dicksee The ARC philosophy does its best to define what art is. There is of course a difference between craft, decorative art, fine art, and good and bad art, and places of grey where it is perhaps hard to draw the line. This of course makes some people angry. They tend to say things like who are you to say what is or is not art but if not us then who? We have stepped forward with scholars and experts, to try and bring respect back to the word and create a sensible type of definition, broad as it may be. Someone had to be the first to publicly state that the emperor has no cloths. Shark parts in formaldehyde are not art, they are at best an educational science tool; statues of the Virgin Mary made out of cow manure is not art, they are just disgusting; putting bags of trash in the center of a museum and calling it installation art, does not make it art, they are still bags of trash. It is like trying to call an apple an orange; just because you say it is, doesnt make it true. Art is an integral part of every culture, having the power to shape nations and civilizations; the word art is something that should be respected, not just given frivolously. We focus on realism because it is the universal language and the only form capable of expressing and communicating without words the depth of mankinds experiences.

Jackson Pollock "Autumn Rhythm" Where did it start? 20th century art movements such as Cubism and Surrealism that promoted abstraction rather than representation.

Colorfield Painting What is it? Colorfield painting is a type of abstract art that consists of broad areas of unmodulated or low-contrast color on a very shallow picture plane. -- Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko , 1943 in a letter to The New York Times When and where did Colorfield painting develop? Clement Greenberg . Morris Louis Stained-Canvas Painting (above right) Helen Frankenthaler (b.1928-), an important painter whose abstraction includes landscape-like images, moved Colorfield painting ahead when she introduced the idea of staining color into unprimed canvas. This innovation in painting provided an ideal of the truly flattened picture plane. -- Barnett Newman "The Sublime is Now", 1948 Who are the significant Colorfield painters? Barnett Newman (1905-1970) and painters Clyfford Still (1904-1980) and Mark Rothko (1903-1970) were innovators in Colorfield painting . Morris Louis (1912-1962) and Kenneth Noland (b.1924), key players in the Washington Colorfield Group, took Frankenthaler's stained canvas idea and built their art upon it. In the late 1960's, using spray guns Jules Olitski (b.1922) made paintings entirely from mists of color. Barnett Newman Painting (left) How does Colorfield Painting relate to Post-Painterly Abstraction? Pompous tone aside, "post-painterly abstraction" incorrectly implies a sequential development in abstract art from gestural into non-gestural painting. In reality, the late 1940's and 1950's saw a fertile, churning sea of abstract art ideas and painting experiments from which various forms emerged and evolved throughout the second half of the 20th century. See the influence of Colorfield painting in the work of 21st century abstract painters such as Todd Bellanca , Jim Napierala and Nancy Van Deren .

Known also as paleochristian art, this funerary art includes frescoes, sculptures, inscriptions and graffiti. Through this artwork, the early christians left testimony of their profound faith in Jesus Christ. Introduction The Catacombs of Rome is a film which contains a very unique collection of Paleochristian art , and includes frescoe paintings, sculptures, greek and latin inscriptions The Christians who employed artists to decorate their tombs were trying to communicate messages, seeking to bring the light of the Gospel into a dark and cold funeral chamber, where their dead lay in "slumber" awaiting the final resurrection. With few colors and expressive brushstrokes, that somewhat resemble 18th century Impressionism, the frescoes of the catacombs have a vibrance of color and life. However, unlike impressionism, which tends to cloud the scene, the catacomb images evoke clarity and purpose. Frescoes, Sculptures, Inscriptions and Graffitti. history which have taken their toll. Sarcophagi Statues Inscriptions sarcophagus is essentially antiquity's marble coffin. It has a variety of sizes ranging from infants to married couples. Some sarcophagi have sculptured reliefs on all four lateral panels, including the top cover slab, while others may be limited to three panels or just the frontal one. The Good Shepherd Vatican Museums Christian Sarcophagus Vatican Museums statues found in the catacombs predominantly are of Jesus, represented as the Good Shepherd. The artistic model was the pagan figure of Orpheus , with the flute to his side and a lamb over his shoulder. Although the Christians did not adorn the catacombs with the miriad of statues the pagans had, they did adapt Orpheus to represent Jesus as the Good Sheperd: "I am the Good Shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep knows me." [Gospel of John, Ch.10 ver.14 ] Inscriptions they are a text, written in greek or latin. they are engravings of signs or symbols inscriptions section afterwards for more information) Graffitti is quite common in the catacombs and its dates cover the 2000 year span. The early christians did not use our modern day spray paint of course, but employed simple cutting tools. Examples of the graffitti found in the catacombs are the messages left by the early Christians on the tombs or walls. There are however also written statements on walls such as one left by an 18th century archeologist who felt himself a priveledged pioneer. He stumbled into a hidden chamber by accident and felt compelled to leave his name and date of discovery. Some early pilgrims also inscribed brief devotional statements at the tombs of the martyrs. archeology Figures and Personalities figures as well as actual historical personalities depicted in the frescoes and sarcophagi. The Deceased Figure in Prayer is usually a person with its arms outstretched. It can be an anonymous person or anyone of the other personalities mentioned above. The pagans prayed with their arms outstretched, and the Christians, as Origen writes, raised their arms further to heaven to remember Jesus on the cross. Many early church personalities appear in the frescoes. Some are: Saints Peter and Paul, St. Cecilia, St. Cyprian and St. Eusibius. There are many Banquet scenes depicting a group of people sitting at the table in the customary fashion of antiquity. Most of these images refer to the eucharistic remembrance of the Last Supper. It is not uncommon to find painted or sculptured images of the deceased. In the Cubicle of the Veiled Woman praying with her arms outstretched. The Decorative Elements "I am the vine, ye are the branches" . [Gospel of John, Ch.15 ver.5] The symbols signs and symbols we find painted in the frescoes, inscribed on the marble sarcophagi and slabs, and etched on the walls of the catacombs all deal with the christian faith, even though some symbols are taken directly from the pagan repertoire. peacock for the pagans was the symbol of eternal life. However, not all the pagans shared the idea of an afterlife, and for those who did, it was one clouded in mystery and wrapped in a shadowy world of obscurity. Pagan art strongly reflects this anguish, which was a vision of pain and sorrow. dove anchor represented hope in Jesus. By turning the anchor upside down, the greek letter TAU was formed, and the "T" resembled the shape of the CROSS. Thus the symbolism of the anchor was enriched by this additional element. Hope in Jesus represented the secure port of Salvation, which came about through His crucifixion and resurrection. The fish was perhaps the favorite christian symbol, and we note the richness of its meaning. The biblical and pagan cultural background was again important in the development of the symbol. The New Testament abounds with references to fish . We recall Christ telling his disciples he will make them fishers of men. [Gospel of Matthew, Ch.4 ver.19] The fish therefore became the symbol of the Christian. He was saved in the net of the gospel news preached by the fishermen apostles. The most important point regarding the symbol of the fish is that in Greek the word fish was written as "ICHTHYS" . There are many misconceptions that the Christian used the word fish as a secret code or password. This is false and demonstrates a lack of history . The word fish was not a secret code, but rather formed an acrostic , which was a typical classical style of poetry by which the letters of a word were ordered to form a phrase, or vice versa. In this case we can vertically read the greek word for fish : I CH TH Y S fish formed a word. The meaning of each greek word formed by the letters ICHTHYS I CH TH Y S oter = Saviour. fish acquired a very profound meaning for the christian. The phrase read: Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour. It was the primitive credo, the fundamental article of faith because it synthesized the theological essence the true follower of Christ was called to profess. The Bible Bible occupies a very important role in the interpretation of catacomb art, whether it be frescoess or scultpures. Without a reference to Biblical literature, the images within the catacombs could not be understood, just as Etruscan funerary images would be unintelligible without reference to mythological literature.
