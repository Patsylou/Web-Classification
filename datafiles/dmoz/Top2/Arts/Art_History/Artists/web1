A Brief Delay At The Wall by John Buxton Posted February 25th, 2014 A Great Example of Art Speak Art Speak, A way by which complex sounding words and concepts are used to create the illusion of something being more then it is as a method to create value, meaning and importance that drastically outweighs what is actually there. Sothebys Contemporary Department said that Cy Twomblys epic 1964 canvas Untitled (Rome) is one of the highlights of our Contemporary Art Evening Auction on 12 February 2014. But what is even more amusing is the video created about the piece for the sale. If one looks at it objectively we can see that the painting really looks like the type of doodling that many peoples two year old children do. At one point the video flashes to a scribble with pencil and says it shows the artists growing confidence. Evidently there are many in the art world who think adults scribbling like children is something people should be willing to pay big bucks for. Although the piece does look like one a child would do, this doodle sold for 12,178,500 British pounds, over 20,000,000 US dollars. Click here to view this incredible example of art speak. Everything about it from the word choice to the British accent to the dramatic music oozes value, when really the work is nothing but scribbles. This concept was also explored in Frederick C. Rosss new speech, titled Why Realism? To read the speech, click here . Posted February 21st, 2014 The Academy of Realist Art, Boston Scholarship Competition The Academy of Realist Art, Boston announces its second annual scholarship competition for promising artists with a love for the academic style of painting and drawing.

ARC has just published a speech titled Why Realism? given by ARC Chairman, Frederick C. Ross, on February 7, 2014 at the University of Connecticut. This was given as the Keynote Address to the Connecticut Society of Portrait Artists. Thinking about this theme, Ive concluded that nothing could be more appropriate than to ask and answer this question: Why Realism? There are finally today many organizations that believe in the value and importance of realism, both classical and contemporary; but why Realism ? Why, after a century of denigration, repression and near annihilation, when the accepted beliefs taught in nearly every high school, college and university for the last hundred years, has been that realism is unoriginal?âŚ My answer is direct, simple and should be self-evident: The visual fine arts of drawing, painting and sculpture are best understood first last and always as a language; a visual language. It was developed and preserved first and foremost as a means of communication very much like spoken and written languages. And like language it is successful if communication takes place and it is unsuccessful if it does not. This answer simultaneously defines the term Fine Art. So fine art is a way that human beings can communicate . To read the full speech, click here .

Posted February 6th, 2014 New Article William Bouguereaus âVirgin of the Liliesâ? versus âMadonna of the Rosesâ? was recently published in the Epoch Times. La Vierge Aux Lys La Madone aux Roses Although William Bouguereau (1825â1905), painted the Madonna and Child several times throughout his career, there are two versions that draw an interesting comparison to one another as they are similar in many ways but hold interesting symbolic differences as well. The first is âLa Vierge aux Lysâ? painted in 1899 and the second is âLa Madone aux Roses,â? in 1903. Both are three quarters length and show only the mother and child with no additional figures.

Jack Rosenberg award-winning artist and guest instructor will be teaching two one-week sessions May 26- 30, and June 2 â 6, 2013. The course would be considered an advanced oil painting class. Surely one of the most personally challenging of painting genres as an artist painting oneself must interpret, judge and decide the setting, pose, mood, â? and style; to depict themselves how they are or how they wish to be.

Self Portrait by Anders Zorn Posted January 23rd, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part II of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. Why, at this time in our history, is there a move away from non-objective art toward realism? There is a strong move towards realism because people are tired of looking at things that do not require skill. I am sure that in the beginning and even into the 1960s and 1970s, it was exciting to experiment by throwing paint or painting dots and squares, finding found objects and putting them on pedestals, but now, that type of art is just dated. It is not representative of the 21st century. I read an article not too long ago in Times Magazine that was an interview with Damien Hurst. He was talking about a series of paintings he was working on that was the largest collection of paintings of spots ever created. Furthermore he went on to say that he only painted a small portion of them and hired other people to paint the vast majority. When the reporter asked him who he found to help him with the work, he said he tried to find people with no artistic talent to show that anyone can produce this type of art. I could not help thinking, ât you embarrassed to say that you are selling paintings created by people who you admit yourself have no artistic talent?â? So people can paint spots, so what. The only amazing thing about it is that people are still being duped into spending tens of thousands of dollars on things they can produce themselves in a couple hours.

Posted January 20th, 2014 Kara Lysandra Ross Interviewed by John Pototschnik Part I of a II part interview has just been published, click here to read the interview. How would you summarize the ARC philosophy? I would say that the main core of the ARC philosophy is that the definition of art has been over expanded to the point where the word has lost its integrity. When any object can be placed on a pedestal and called art, when anything is art, then nothing is art. Anytime you have a definition that expands to encompass everything, then it ceases to have meaning. An Offering by Frank Dicksee The ARC philosophy does its best to define what art is. There is of course a difference between craft, decorative art, fine art, and good and bad art, and places of grey where it is perhaps hard to draw the line. This of course makes some people angry. They tend to say things like who are you to say what is or is not art but if not us then who? We have stepped forward with scholars and experts, to try and bring respect back to the word and create a sensible type of definition, broad as it may be. Someone had to be the first to publicly state that the emperor has no cloths. Shark parts in formaldehyde are not art, they are at best an educational science tool; statues of the Virgin Mary made out of cow manure is not art, they are just disgusting; putting bags of trash in the center of a museum and calling it installation art, does not make it art, they are still bags of trash. It is like trying to call an apple an orange; just because you say it is, doesnt make it true. Art is an integral part of every culture, having the power to shape nations and civilizations; the word art is something that should be respected, not just given frivolously. We focus on realism because it is the universal language and the only form capable of expressing and communicating without words the depth of mankinds experiences.

The Smart-Ass Guide to Art So what the heck is this? The "Smart-Ass Guide to Art" is a compilation of artists that I find interesting, important, or just downright freaky. Its focus is to present interesting information about these folks, (such as where you'll find them ripped off in pop culture) or at least to present information entertainingly. Why are you doing this? Originally, this started as a weekend project when I was still in college. Much like Frankenstein's little project, things have gone horribly awry. I'm putting it on the web (with some modifications) because, to me, the sad thing about art is that it's so... pretentious. Why can't something be academic AND entertaining?
