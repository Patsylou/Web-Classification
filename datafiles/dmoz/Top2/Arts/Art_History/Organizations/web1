The aim of this roundtable is to address issues of legislation, labor and class within the academy whilst finding ways to acknowledge the value of the Humanities in university education. In our role as Visual Art and Humanities professors, our membership in the Art Association has long been the organizing principle of our potential solidarity. The perpetual decline of Art History/Visual Studies has recently led to public scrutiny of the centralized leadership of the College Art Association (see CAA Blog, An Open Letter to Victoria H.F. Scott Regarding the CAA, February 8, 2013). In light of the continuing need for political advocacy, the leadership of the art association could provide a means for organizing coalition and for affecting the status of the Humanities by bringing greater representation and awareness to both academic and public spheres.

Nineteenth-century art is broadly defined as all art that was produced between the American Revolution and the First World War, regardless of geographic boundaries.

An additional session offers opportunities to younger scholars to present papers related to their doctoral research. AHNCA holds a business meeting at each CAA conference. The association publishes two newsletters each year, as well as an annual membership directory.
