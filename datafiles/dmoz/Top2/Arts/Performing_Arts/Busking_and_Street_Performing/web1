 At a media event in City Hall on February 19th, the Edmonton International Street Performers Festival kicked off its 30th Anniversary year with performances, the announcement of a NEW fundraiser, and the unveiling of a NEW look. The NEW Festival fundraiser, Vaudeville Madness, took place on February 22nd and was a success in transforming the winter â into 'oohs ahhs'âŚwhile raising funds for the Festival and its programs. Thank you to all who bought tickets and enjoyed the show! And extra special thanks for the artists involved (Annie Dugan from Firefly Circus; singer-songwriter Andrea House; Ron Pearson with his Mystery Wonder Show, Calgary stunt clown Gustavo the Impossiblist, and Aytahn Ross with his circus/comedy act, The Great Balanzo.)

Go to THE FORUMS... performers.net is a division of The Jim Group busker They are also referred to as street performers, traveling musicians, street entertainers, circle acts, street musicians, street theater, sidewalk, subway, and street-corner performers, minstrels, troubadours, and bards of Shakespearean decent. Buskers are that rare breed of street entertainers in search of the best place or "pitch" to perform their artistic endeavor. Buskers can be dancers, mimes, artists, clowns, magicians, musicians, puppeteers, jugglers, acrobats, tumblers, story-tellers, and living statues. They can be sword swallowers, balloonists, fortune tellers, contortionists, escape artists, rope walkers, fire eaters, and more. The itinerant entertainers can even be just plain weird. A busker's stage can be anywhere from fairs and festivals to trains and cablecars. Depending on their motivation, these street performers sometime travel the globe with their astounding acts reaching far-away lands and peoples with their unique form of entertainment. In some cultures, they are considered a living curiosity. With a great street stage or "pitch", buskers can easily amass huge audiences with literally thousands of people entertained daily. Busker Central's mission is all about elevating public consciousness and educating internet users what it means to be an authentic busker. It's hard to estimate the world-wide busker population. Some have it in the tens of thousands in Europe alone with the vast majority yet to go online. These buskers are busy performing their art just like they always have. They may even spring from a family or village with a long history of performing. Misunderstood in some lands and illegal in others, busking is truly a cultural phenomena. Considering the term itself, the United States is one of the few countries that does not employ the word "busker". Instead, the term "street performer" is used along side with all sorts of mis-conceptions alluding to homeless, criminal, alcoholic, and transient deeds. When dressed nonchalantly, the busker is often perceived as a loser. A major difference between an "indoor" performance and "street" performance is that the latter usually takes place on a street-corner with the unpaid busker actively soliciting tips after their show. Raw talent and crowd size play major factors in success. It is usually during the passing of the hat that people can get the outdoor performance confused with begging. If you liked the show, simply let the hat know. While it has a considerable Irish and German musical influence, the USA only has a few major cities directly involved promoting street performing. Strangely, busking is often illegal. Police can bring charges against buskers for blocking the sidewalk, disturbing the peace, pan-handling, and begging. Fortunately in several societies, the busker is a lucky, friendly, and familiar sight. They perform, entertain young and old, travel, and make their livelihood uninterrupted as they have for hundreds of years. Many successful buskers will tell you it's all about energy. Jugglers on unicycles defy gravity by keeping several balls in the air at once. Musicians feverishly belt out their songs for all to hear. A Mime throughly captivates a whole city block with antics without saying a single word. A street artist entertains with a 10 foot pole. A Human Statue stands motionless for hours within a deep trance. Still another busker roller-skates down the boardwalk wearing flowing sheets, a turbin, and playing guitar. A handicapped artist is painting with his feet in Lisbon while another busker is busy doing headstands on broken shards of glass in Barcelona. Snake charmers perform their shows in the streets of New Delhi, fireblowers are belching smoke in Istanbul, and the hurdy gurdy man is cranking out the tunes in Vienna. Some buskers perform all day, everyday. Some are totally unique in their performance whose style is not found anywhere else. Some buskers even compete in huge busker festivals celebrating excellence in street performing. Right now, all over the world, buskers are busy presenting their show living a life of wonder outside the office cube and down the carefree highway. They are actively creating their own life-style and are presenting their art "in living color". Street-corner performers are usually highly skilled in their craft by several years. Reliant on these artistic skills, buskers can often be found voyaging to distant lands performing along the way. Make no mistake about it. This is their nature doing what the real busker loves - performing, passing-the-hat, counting, and traveling - forever lost in the search...of that elusive perfect pitch.

Thanks to all who helped (especially Ali!) My name is Mark Di Giuseppe better known as, The Straniero, Radio Guaglione or The Philharmonic Orchestra of the Spanish Quarter of Naples, arguably one of the most famous one man bands in the world. I'm was born in the U.S. but am now based in Italy with more than 20 years of experience building insane instruments and playing all over the world. My music is very hard to describe because of all the styles and influences I've had traveling around the world. The pieces I do vary from jazz traditionals to rock, RB, soul and funk to classical to Italian and Neopolitan classics to gypsy, arab, Indian and yiddish folk. If I had to describe music in a few words, I'd say to go find out who Spike Jones His City Slickers were. That's about as close as you're going to come to me. In this web site you can find out all about my shows, my experiences traveling around our planet, information about building instruments, other artists and lots of miscellaneous information that makes me the eclectic mix of that I am. This video is an exploration of motion and type effects inspired by the topic of . It was created in Apple's Motion 4 from a design brief suggested by my friend and co-worker David Thomas. I combined various elements from Motion's built in content along with filters from the FX Factory's plug-in. A number of the scenes also use animated cameras in Motion to give some added excitement to the animations. Over the school holidays in June 2011, the kids and I put together this clip by shooting mostly stills but also a bit of video on my Canon IXUS 60 and editing in Final Cut Pro after converting the image sequences to ProRes via Quicktime 7. The song is Black Water Gold by African Music Machine. Don't get too confused though, only three of the fours kids belong to me. Child number four just happened to be playing at our house that day so was happy to get involved. For our family christmas card for 2010, the kids helped out with the artwork and we all assembled this piece together in Apple's Motion 4. The music of course is Linus and Lucy by Vince Gauraldi which comes from my favourite TV Christmas show of all time, Charlie Brown's Christmas. Get the song Linus and Lucy on iTunes
