ABOUT THE EBONY SHOWCASE THEATRE AND ITS FOUNDERS About Nick and Edna Stewart and the Ebony Showcase Filmography A Word From Valarie Stewart: All of the white buildings shown in this photo were a part of the theater complex. The entire complex that had housed our organization, including a house not shown in the picture, was taken in eminent domain by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. The theater ediface was demolished in 1998, the rest of he complex was demolished, building-by-building. Redevelopment and its abuses were abolished by Governor Jerry Brown and the California State Supreme Court and officially ended in 2012, too late to save our buildings. Contrary to propaganda on the internet and elsewhere, we have absolutely no affiliation with the City-owned Nate Holden Performing Arts Center, nor with the Ebony Repertory Theater that is housed there. They are often confused with our organization because their theater was built where our buildings once stood. Thank you to everyone who helped us in the past. Your contributions were not in vain. We were able to transform into an internet business where we continued to provide quality entertainment through our MailOrder MovieHouse Project where we sell classic movies and vintage TV shows, such as silent and talkie movies, documentaries, rare and hard-to-find classics, etc., that provide both entertainment and education; and through our People Need to Know Project where we tell about special internet offers, present and address important issues to tell the other side of the story. Our motto is Education, Artistic and Cultural Enrichment, through Entertainment.
