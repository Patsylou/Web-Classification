 Vol. 94 Updated Jan. 31, 2014 Playwright Ikue Osada (b. 1977) is the focus of attention today as a rising presence in the field of critical biographic drama. As the leader of the theater unit Tegamiza, she has researched, written and brought to the stage biographical dramas about actual historical figures including author Edogawa Ranpo, poet Misuzu Kaneko, poet and author Kenji Miyazawa and folklorist Tsuneichi Miyamoto. Her works, articulated in words she has discovered through voluminous researches and visits to the sites of her subjects lives, overflow with the passion of people who lived on the brink in times of struggle and change. This interview explores the inspirations behind the playwrights biographical works. In 2012, Kaori Seki was the winner of two prestigious prizes in Japans dance world, The French Embassy Prize for Young Choreographers of the Yokohama Dance Collection EX and the Next Generation Choreographer Award grand prix of the Toyota Choreography Awards. In her unique works explore the sensitivities and perceptivity of the body with dancers clad in body tights like thin underwear that explore each others bodies slowly with unique movement like primeval creatures. In this interview we seek insights into Sekis artist world that is opening up new possibilities in contemporary dance. Coming to dance after competing in rhythmic gymnastics from childhood, Mariko Kakizaki has been developing her career since 2012 as a member of the Batsheva Ensemble, the young dancer ensemble of Israels prestigious Batsheva Dance Company. While studying dance at Japans Tsukuba University, Kakizaki had her first encounter with the Gaga physical movement method developed by Batsheva artistic director Ohad Naharin, which eventually led her to take on the challenge of performing in Israel. This interview gives insights into Kakizaki the person and her ambitions in dance.

This play has been nominated for the 17th Tsuruya Nanboku Drama Award and the 58th Kishida Kunio Drama Award (final award judging Feb. 19, 2014). During Japans early Showa Period (from 1926), the banker and folklorist, Keizo Shibusawa, used his own finances to create a museum of Japanese folklore named the Attic Museum. The play takes the form of a critical biographic drama focusing on Shibusawa and his colleague Tsuneichi Miyamoto, a folklorist known for his extensive fieldwork, and it explores the subject of the work of people who seek to preserve and communicate the of an ethnic culture. This is a play created by the internationally active contemporary artist Miwa Yanagi based on extensive research. It provides a truthful portrayal of the Japanese-American women who served as announcers on the Zero Hour propaganda radio programs created by the Japanese military for broadcast to Allied troops and seamen fighting in the Pacific theater of World War II.
