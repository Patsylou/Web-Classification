VoilÃ  des dates et des lieux qui vont vous intÃ©resser ! Lors de mes tournÃ©es en cirque, j'ai rencontrÃ© beaucoup de gens passionnÃ©s par le cirque. Beaucoup d'entre eux avaient quelques documents sur le cirque qui traÃ®naient dans une caisse au grenier ou qui prenaient l'humiditÃ© dans une cave. J'ai trouvÃ© cela dommage et j'ai eu l'envie de faire un centre de documentation et d'archives. Notre but est de rÃ©unir dans un mÃªme endroit un exemplaire des divers documents provenant des cirques, tels que les programmes, les affiches, les prospectus, les billets de rÃ©duction, les tickets d'entrÃ©e, etc. Mais aussi d'autres Ã©lÃ©ments concernant le monde du cirque, comme des articles de presse, des revues, des livres, des timbres, des cartes postales, des cartes tÃ©lÃ©phoniques, des jouets (ou des catalogues de jouets),... Nous rassemblons tout ce qui a un rapport avec le cirque, mais aussi avec la fÃªte foraine. Nous voulons Ã©galement faire profiter de ces renseignements Ã  toute personne Ã  la recherche d'information ou de documentation concernant le cirque. Vous trouverez sur ce site la liste des documents de notre collection, les coordonnÃ©es de diverses revues et clubs du cirque, une liste de spectacles en tournÃ©e, les parutions les plus fraÃ®ches (nouveaux livres, jouets,...), des liens Internet vers le monde du cirque, etc. Bien entendu, nous faisons part de ces informations dans la mesure oÃ¹ nous les recevons. Comme le cirque est universel, il est impossible de rÃ©aliser ce centre sans aide. Peut-Ãªtre que vous aussi, vous pouvez nous faire parvenir un document qui traÃ®ne dans le fond d'un de vos tiroirs. Nous espÃ©rons Ã©galement que des journalistes, des directeurs de cirque et des artistes voudront bien nous aider, comme certains le font dÃ©jÃ . Comme ce centre n'a aucun but commercial, ni subside, ni sponsor, tous les documents, objets ou piÃ¨ces susceptibles de nous intÃ©resser sont les bienvenus. J'espÃ¨re que vous serez nombreux Ã  Ãªtre intÃ©ressÃ©s par ce site et que vous pourrez nous aider Ã  faire de notre centre une rÃ©ussite. Pour que le cirque prenne la place qu'il n'a jamais eue, et qu'il mÃ©rite pourtant, au sein de la culture.

You'll have to move into a circus trailer, and it may be located next to the scary lion trailer or, worse yet, the foul-smelling elephant trailer. You'll be expected to put on a smile and work weekdays, weekends and some holidays, through fatigue and bad moods, even when there are only five people in the audience. After each succession of performances is over, you pack up, move to a new town and do it all over again; this goes on year-round. The upside to all of this is that you'll get to see the world (or at least the country), and the awe and applause of the audience may keep you motivated. Plus, because of their nomadic lifestyle, circus people form tight-knit communities. Marriage between circus folk is common, and kids often travel with the crew and get schooled by their performing parents. So if you join the circus, you'll inherit a very special family.

Coney Island Circus Sideshow Prev Next The last traditional 10-in 1 continuous sideshow performing in a circus or amusement context includes a cast of live professional performers, many at the top of their field. Located in the home of sideshow culture, in an official New York City Landmark with its own sideshow pedigree, and offering traditional shows and Sideshow School, our facility is to sideshow culture what the Actorâs Studio is to American acting: we are the International Center of Sideshow Arts. This work takes place in our facility, Sideshows by the Seashore. It represents the origins of American Theater, starting with PT Barnum in 1842, and continuing through the mid-20th c. changes to entertainment culture with Houdini, Ringling Bros and Ripleyâs Believe-It-or-Not and is also the home of the American Sideshow Hall of Fame. The Sideshow is one of our oldest and most important programs and of of the 15-20 different artistic programs we produce, it is the most visible, most egalitarian, and most memorable for visitors to Coney Island. The continuous 10 in 1 format was once shared by other popular entertainments like burlesque and vaudeville but is quite rare today. All 10 acts are scripted with traditional dialogue going back half a century and the show represents a highly evolved and intricate structure in a field full of street-buskers. In addition, the Sideshow fulfills our goal of creating innovative artistic programming that seamlessly integrates with the fabric of the amusement area, bringing in foot-traffic from all over Coney Island and creating engaging and surprising artistic work for an audience who are not traditional theater-goers. And that audience is massive â theyâre multi-cultural, primarily low income, and almost exclusively under-served by artistic programming in NYC. Although we are a family friendly show, we also have a reputation for encouraging new directions and trends in our field: this yearâs cast will consist of 10 performers, several of which are new to our stage and several visiting artists. In the past, the world's foremost sword swallowers and fire eaters have worked in our cast, and weâre excited to welcome group of assertive young "born different" performers this summer who think the talented and handicapped have as much right to be rock stars on stage as doctors and lawyers. As such, we will be hosting a number of guest performers: Lilâ Miss Firefly, âthe Midget of Mischiefâ?, who stands 27â? tall but has a big list of credits to her name, including touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Marilyn Manson, Justin Timberlake and others; and Mat Fraser, the worlds foremost international spokesman for the disability rights community, MC of Londonâs Special Olympics, and producer of âThalidomide! The Musicalâ?. In addition to guests, our core cast will include The Human Gumby (contortionist), Ray Valenz (MC and human blockhead), Betty Bloomerz (Sword Swallower), Rush Aaron Hicks (stretchable-skinned boy). The 2014 sideshow will remain at an affordable price, in keeping with our mission, although, because of the extraordinary costs of rebuilding after Sandy, we are hoping to find alternative ways of subsidizing this ticket price â through additional memberships, a donation drive at the ticket box, and new ways of communicating who we are to visitors who think weâre just âa part of the amusement parkâ?. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 10 LIVE ACTS ATTRACTIONS! Current sideshow cast members are: Scott Baker Ray Valenz Betty Bloomerz Princess Pat Rush Aaron Hicks Alejandro Dubois Leo The Human Gumby *Please Note: Not all performers perform on the same days SCHEDULE FOR 2014 CONEY ISLAND CIRCUS SIDESHOW April 19, 20 (last ticket sold at 7pm) May 10, 11, 17, 18, 23-26, 30, 31, 1pm - 8pm (last ticket sold at 7pm).

Pugh Cole Bros. Circus John and Brigitte Pugh continue the tradition begun by W.W.Cole more than 125 years ago. A s President and CEO of Cole Bros. Circus, John Pugh has not only kept the Circus alive, but has reshaped and energized The World's Largest Circus Under The Big Top. His ingenuity spurred him to design a radically different Big Top a huge canvas arena that omits the maze of quarter poles traditionally used to support large tents used by American circuses, and does not require the time and labor-intensive bridgework and cupola used in European Circus tents. John's innovative Big Top is stronger and safer than traditional tents, can be erected quickly, and affords audiences a virtually unobstructed view of the performance. John's skill, professionalism and exceptional achievements in the circus world have gained national and international recognition. There is a John W. Pugh Ring of the Circus Model Builder's Association, and a John W. Pugh Tent of the Circus Fans Association of America. At the request of H.S.H. Rainier III, John served as a judge of the prestigious International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo. The United Kingdom's World's Fair Association presented John its "International Award," and John received Sarasota's Ringling Museum's "Power Behind the Scenes" Award. On January 17, 2010 John Pugh was inducted into the Circus Ring of fame which noted, "Few have done more to preserve the traditions of the traveling, 3-Ring Tented American Circus." John's lovely wife, Brigitte, his steadfast partner in the circus as well as in life, proudly introduced her husband at the Ring of Fame ceremony, recounting the numerous occasions on which John saved Cole Bros. Circus. Cole Bros. Circus evidences John Pugh's dedication to the outdoor amusement industry, his respect and admiration for the fans and patrons of the circus and his great love for the extended Cole Bros. family with whom he works.
