In fact, it's quite good, at least up until the final reel, when the story takes a wonky turn. But give director John Luessenhop and the writers their just desserts: after the withering of the once-promising "re-imagined" Texas Chainsaw Massacre Texas Chainsaw 3D will please fans of the series by including not only actors, but also sly references to elements, from previous Chainsaw installments. The VW van? It's in there, although a later model. The slaughterhouse motif? Check. Indeed, this film might claim the rights to being a direct sequel to Tobe Hooper's original, had his 1986 film not gotten it so right the first time....

It's the tale of a group of young people who, due to car trouble in Florida, find themselves in a much larger world of hurt when they happen upon the wrong house. Sounds like a familiar premise?

The highly-rated and critically-acclaimed cable series follows a group of survivors led by sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. The trailer features tantalizing details, including the appearance of two popular characters from Robert Kirkman's original comic book series: Katana -wielding heroine Michonne (Danai Gurira) and the malevolent villain known simply as The Governor (David Morrissey), plus the return of a certain character thought to be dead and gone.

Harry Manfredini was the first person from the Friday Psycho , which is ironic, since John Carpenter?s classic Halloween , which was the inspiration for Friday The 13th being made, was made as tribute to Psycho , so it all comes full circle. The film?s use of music only when the killer is present, to my knowledge, had never been done before and only contributes to the film?s strength and longevity....

Composer Harry Manfredini has tirelessly assembled select cues from the first six Friday The 13th films and arranged them into seamless musical suites. This is the first time any music from Parts IV , V and VI have ever been commercially released; all new music for the seventh and eighth installments were composed by Fred Mollin, while Harry's scores for Jason Goes To Hell and Jason X have already been released on compact disc.

Fans will now be able to hear digital-quality recordings of the gripping prologue music leading into the opening titles from the original film; the soothing piano/synthesizer "morning after" theme before an angry Young Jason interrupts the calm; the diabolical cue from Part III when Mrs. Voorhees herself rises from Crystal Lake to impossibly claim yet another victim; and as a special bonus, the full version of "Sail Away, Tiny Sparrow," which was the country song played in the diner scene from Part I ; plus so much more!

In its corner, it's directed and co-written by the celebrated Sam Raimi. It deals with issues of eternal damnation, lurking demons and decomposing old ladies, among other horrors. Elsewhere, it's branded by that hated PG-13 rating. On the heels of that, let's add that there's no nudity, and the violence is mostly bloodless.

Read More Blood on a Budget Blood on a Budget: More Psycho Sick Lunatics Patrick Dolan on February 25, 2014 | Leave a comment Featuring Bludgeon and Shism Psychoses are a tricky subject. When presented on film, people who suffer from this rarely get the politically correct treatment. Their portrayal tends to fall into one of two categories: the family of diverse, kindhearted kooks of a psychiatric facility ( Girl, Interupted , The Princess and the Warrior , One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest ) or the solo psycho on the verge of -or in the midst of- a killing spree ( Maniac , Pieces , Psycho ). Sometimes the two are even combined ( Dont Look in the Basement ). Few films venture out of these stereotypes, and even fewer horror films. Although the films of this entry tend to gravitate near the solo psycho and the sympathetic clan of crazies categories -not to mention playing fast-and-loose with political correctness- they still manage break out of the box in they portrayals of psychiatric disorders.

Skinny Puppy The day that Skinny Puppyâs âLive Shape for Armsâ? tour thundered into Toronto, February 18, 2014, the music news world was focused on the fact that date was the 40th anniversary of the release of the first KISS album. No doubt that debut was important to rock â roll.

Their plots frequently involve themes of death, the supernatural or mental illness. Horror movies also usually include a central villain. Early horror movies were largely based on classic literature of the gothic/horror genre, such as Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Phantom of the Opera and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. More recent Horror movies , in contrast, often draw inspiration from the insecurities of life after World War II, giving rise to the three distinct, but related, sub-genres: the horror-of-personality Psycho film, the horror-of-armageddon Invasion of the Bodysnatchers film, and the horror-of-the-demonic The Exorcist film. The last sub-genre may be seen as a modernized transition from the earliest Horror movies Horror movies have been dismissed as violent, low budget B-movies and exploitation films. Nonetheless, all the major studios and many respected directors, including Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, William Friedkin, Richard Donner, Francis Ford Coppola, and George Romero have made forays into the genre. Serious critics have analyzed Horror movies through the prisms of genre theory and the auteur theory.
