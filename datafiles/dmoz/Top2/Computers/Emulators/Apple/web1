 KEGS/SDL Apple IIGS emulator What is it? Here is my holiday hack on the great KEGS Apple IIGS emulator, which consists of implementing an SDL driver for video, sound, keyboard, and joystick. This should make the emulator portable to many more OSes (incl. BeOS, MacOS, Linux, Win32). The code is based on the original KEGS, with modifications from the KEGS32 port (current version includes modifications up to kegs32r2) Screenshots The only visible difference with the original KEGS is the KEGS control panel, which can be reached by typing control-openapple-tab, as seen on these screenshots: 1 , 2 , 3 . You can also notice that the status lines are now using the Apple II font (the basic SDL library has no font support). Using SDL, KEGS can now also run in fullscreen mode (either 640x480 or 640x400). TODO I would like to add the following: possibility to paste text to the emulator (on X11 and possibly Win32) disk swapping facility (probably OS-specific too, possibly drag'n'drop). support for keyboards other than QWERTY (like the infamous French keyboard). Download Cygwin compiler (I don't have VC++). kegs-sdl-0.64.tar.gz ( release notes ) kegs-0.63.tar.gz kegs-0.62-0.63.patch.gz kegs-0.61-0.62.patch.gz There is a patch for KEGS 0.63 that optimizes palette changes (which happen frequently in demos or games), but require a change in the SDL library. Please read carefully the instructions inside. If anyone manages to compile and run it on anything other than Linux, Unix or Cygwin, please contact me . Links KEGS , the original emulator by Kent Dickney, which was once behind KEGS-SDL and KEGS-OSX in terms of functionnality, but Kent decided not to integrate most of our changes into his version.

 Download Sourceforge Project Page GSport Main Download Operating Developing Emulated Ethernet Emulated Printer History GSport GSport is a portable (in the programming sense) Apple IIgs emulator, based on the KEGS cross-platform IIgs emulator by Kent Dickey. The base emulator builds and runs on all of the same platforms that KEGS did, and the new capabilities are being integrated as contributors have time and interest. Project Goals The main goal for GSport is to provide a free, open ecosystem for the continuation of cross-platform development of IIgs emulation. Some interesting advances that initially spawned this project are Uthernet and printer support. As those objectives are met, we will move on to the next objectives. Do you have something that you wish a GS emulator did? Submit a request here, or better yet - dive in and contribute!

Technically, the worst culprit is a retrieving a non-existant block or track/sector. Various interface improvements. Requirement of a Java JVM as well as SWT for the interface. The Win32 (compiled) version of AppleCommander doesn't interpret graphic image colors correctly - however the Java JAR version does. tracker Future Requirements Java - If you need to install Java, go to the Sun Java SWT ! compiling Download Note: Please read the requirements and download Java and the SWT code, if required first!
