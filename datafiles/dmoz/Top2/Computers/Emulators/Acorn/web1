Sourceforge project page 03/02/2002 OSLib 13/12/2001 Hello World 31/07/2001 30/05/2001 Chris Rutter died in March, and this is bit of a blow, both personally and for the project. I've got my university finals in about five days, after which I'm moving to York and starting a consultancy firm 25/12/2000 08/08/2000 very geeky holiday 28/07/2000 Later on... 27/07/2000 23/07/2000 Alice has been visiting, but Chris Rutter has been working on a replacement ARM emulation (called sleeve ... groan...) and Nick Burrett has given me permission to distribute a similar project of his which can run GCC; it's available here 19/07/2000 Sourceforge project page and help me out! There's another page 18/07/2000 15/07/2000 14/07/2000 Silent Hill 13/07/2000 strrchr Downloading riscose Get the nightly code snapshot if you just want a quick look. Follow these instructions if you want to keep an up-to-date source tree from CVS. Helping out Terms of distribution Sourceforge project page , Riscose can be distributed either in source or binary form under the terms of the GNU Public License Useful links sleeve is the ARM emulation developed by Chris Rutter which will soon be the preferred core for riscose; RISC OS Ltd. (who, at the time of writing, have fewer full-time programmers working on their product than this project has :-) ) ROX is a RISC OS-type desktop environment for Linux machines, mimicking the look + feel (including a Filer clone and other goodies) rather than doing any emulation; Darren Salt's web pages featuring ports of many GNU tools, which I'm planning to use for testing Zap , the RISC OS programmers editor and swiss-army knife which has been described as `better than sex' Sourceforge , the generous people who host this site Dave Gilbert's web site , a guy who's already written a hardware-level emulation of an Archimedes Robin Watts has all sorts of interesting documents on his web page, not least an ARM processor cheat sheet Phil Blundell has done some experiments to make RISC OS binaries run under ARMLinux and wrote a program and kernel patch that runs Twin Sourceforge are the generous people who host this site. SWARM is another ARM emulation, written in C++ ARMphetamine is another ARM emulation (dynamically recompiling, no less) this times optimised for speed. I'd have used it instead of the ARMulator but it looks complicated at the moment :-) Brandy is a reimplementation of BBC BASIC V in ANSI C, and ripe for integrating into riscose one day. !Virtual is a RISC OS program that traps just enough SWIs to allow RISC OS compilers to believe they have virtual memory available. A neat trick, and a prototype of what we're trying to achieve here :-) Mailing list If you want to chat about it, or help development, or at least know when there'll be some code released, mail riscose-subscribe@lists.soup-kitchen.net Matthew Bloch, mattbee@soup-kitchen.net

 Arcimage for Latest News see end Arcimage is a DOS based programme written by Jasper Renow-Clarke which allows reading from and writing to Acorn format 800kD and 800kE discs on a PC in the form of disk images on the PC's Hard drive. Version 1.2 modified by Tom Humphrey also allows reading and writing of 1.6Mb F discs. This version is experimental and therefore could cause problems but I think it is worth making available. Both versions are stand alone programmes but are intended to be used in conjunction with the PC based Acorn Emulators Archie , Red Squirrel and Virtual A5000 . The programme works with many of the emulated DOS versions supplied with Windows, check the Compatibility List at the end. The reason for writing these notes is that I had a great struggle getting the programme to do anything! When I started writing this page I had had no contact with anyone else (other than another user who was struggling like me!) but I have now heard from the authors and have obtained some more details and files which can be downloaded from the links below. Obtaining and installing Arcimage V1.1, Pascal Source Code arcimg.pas (12k) Arcimage V1.1, Ready to go arcimg.exe (10k) Arcimage V1.1, "Read Me" file readme.txt (2k) Arcimage V1.1, All the above files, zipped arcimg.zip (19k) And also Arcimage V1.2 from Tom Humphrey. Arcimage V1.2 Ready to go arcimg.exe (15k) Arcimage V1.2 "Read Me" file readme.txt (5k) Arcimage V1.2 All the version 1.2 files, zipped arcimg.zip (16k) Using Arcimage to read a floppy arcimg blocks /read (return) The programme will announce itself then say it is reading the image "blocks", It will then start reading the entire disk, as it does it will show the track it is reading from 0 to 79 (for those of us old enough to remember the BBC B and it's formatter for 5.25" 100k disks there is a distinct feeling of deja-vu!!). The programme will then say it has finished reading the disk and return to the DOS Prompt. WARNING, if you are using High Density (HD) floppy disks (indicated by a hole through the disk on the opposite side to the write protect slide) formatted to 800k you MUST cover the hole with a piece of tape or bit of disk label etc. before inserting it in the PC, otherwise the drive will insist on trying to read it as an HD Disk and it will fail. Acorn machines ignore this hole and make their judgement as to which kind of disk it is entirely by the data on the disk. (see note at end of page about using HD floppies). 1.6 Mb floppies must of course have this hole uncovered. You should now have a new file called blocks in the floppyimg directory which will be 800k (819200 bytes) or 1.6Mb (1638400 bytes). It is important to understand this is not just a copy of the files on the disk but the entire surface including the blank space and the filing information; hence the file size and indeed the time taken to copy the disk is the same irrespective of whether the disk is nearly full or blank. Using an image with Red Squirrel Writing an image back to a floppy disk arcimg blocks /write As before the programme will announce itself, announce the filename then commence to write track by track. When the transfer is complete the programme will announce it then return to the DOS prompt. Note that although the disc in the drive must be of the right format it need not be blank, since the writing process will overwrite the information on the disk. General 1.6Mb discs These can only be read by the latest version (1.2), if you need to use them download it. Note that in this case it is essential that you DO NOT cover the HD ident hole! Disc formatting For 800k arcimg /format800 For 1.6Mb arcimg /format1600 As this is a beta version the author is still very much experimenting! Failures Using HD disks at 800k Compatability Windows 95 However it does NOT WORK with the following :- Windows NT The author of V1.2 Tom Humphrey has confirmed this is the case and that it is due to the limited hardware access given by the DOS emulations provided with these versions of Windows and asked that this info be provided so that people do not struggle hopelessly if the operating system wont run it! Tom does say he will attempt a full 32 bit re-write of the software which should solve the problems, but sadly he cannot do so at the moment. As soon as I have a new version I will make it available. back to top of page Final Thoughts don.scott@dial.pipex.com And of course the authors are also interested in feedback :- Jasper Renow-Clarke jasperr@osl1.co.uk Tom Humphrey t.humphrey@bigfoot.com Donald Scott 25th May 2002 Latest News 11/03/2006 http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/

 Enter your search terms Submit search form I have therefore made a test version of the program available for download. You can download it here (7543 KB). The program uses a JIT compiler to convert Arm machine code to x86 code so will only work on Intel Mac's at the moment. However, there is also code in RPCEmu to interpret the Arm processor so once this is working, the program will work on Power PC's as well (although slower). I have now got the PPC code working and you can download it here (7476 KB). As expected, it does run rather slowly. I haven't included any OS ROM images so you will have to provide your own. If you don't have a three button mouse, the middle mouse menu button is on Alt-Command (or F14). Ctrl-Alt-Command brings up a GUI menu to configure the program (or Ctrl-F14). There is limited sound support at the moment. Everything else I have tested seems to be working OK. on your system , can you please send me get in touch .

Sprite save now works, even if BeebIt uses bigger than 640x256 mode. If on entering emulation boot fails (ie corrupt MOS rom image) then BeebIt will return to the desktop with an error. On RISC OS 6 now uses BeebIt's own mode 7 emulation, rather than that provided by the VideoTTX module. here . here here or at the BBC Lives Site here . Note: Pace Micro Technology Limited .
