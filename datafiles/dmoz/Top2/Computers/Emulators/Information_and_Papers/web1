CEF Overview The Computer Emulation Framework (CEF) is an application framework specification for the purposes of emulating various computer hardware configurations in software. CEF uses independant components, each of which emulates some hardware, such as a CPU or memory. These components can be connected together to form complete computer emulators. The components can be mixed or matched as desired. Uses for CEF include low-level debugging, simulation of unavailable hardware, cross-assembly, and emulation of one computer on another. Goals 1) to provide a framework which is at a low-enough level to allow accurate emulation and simulation of any hardware that exists to this time, but without being so low level that the speed of emulation makes the resulting application useless. 2) to provide a consistent base user interface for emulators. 3) to speed development of emulators by providing several general-use components and utilities. CEF32 Reference Implementation for MS Windows Download CEF32 , a complete implementation of the CEF specification for Microsoft Windows, including several components, emulators, and fonts. This also serves as a reference implementation of the specification. Notes April, 2011 Version 2.5 released. August, 2008 Version 2.4 released. June, 2008 Version 2.3 released.
