MAMEUI seems to be the popular choice for users of the MAME emulator, as its easier to deal with than a command link based version of MAME. This version of MAMEUI is available in both 32bit and 64bit versions. Download MAMEUI .135.2 at our MAME page. 2 Comments 1a , MAME , Uncategorized Posted at 3:28 pm Raine 0.51.7 is an emulator, it emulates some M68000 and M68020 arcade games and is mainly focused on Taito and Jaleco games hardware. Raine is also available for Linux .  It started as an experiment with the Rainbow Islands romset, dumped by Aracorn/Romlist. Raine can emulate many nice games now, including new additions from Cave and other companies. Sound was improved thanks to the work of Hiromitsu Shioya. More recently, several new programmers have joined Raine Team, adding drivers making improvements. Emulating cpus and sound chips takes quite a lot of coding time, so, like most of the current emulators, Raine uses emulation engines already available when possible. Download Raine at our Arcade game emulation page .

For indexing and simplicity sake, I will call it a Windows emulator anyway, heh. Wine 1.1.33 is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X, OpenGL, and Unix. Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100% non-Microsoft code, however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes, including Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris. Wine 1.1.33 has the following changes: Read the rest of this entry No Comments 1a , Emulator News , Windows emulators Posted November 8, 2009 at 11:55 pm Dolphin SVN r4524 is a Wii and Gamecube emulator for Windows.

As the binaries released for MESS are Windows based, SDLMESS can be compiled on a variety of platforms, including Linux, MacOS, and of course Windows. Download at our MESS page . No Comments 1a , Emulator News , MESS and Multi System emulation Posted at 11:47 pm MESS .135 is to computers and consoles as MAME is to arcade machines. i.e. It is an attempt to exactly emulate early computer and console systems. It is based primarily on the MAME source code so versions run in parallel to MAME. The reason MESS can use MAME as a basis is that most chips in computers and consoles are direct copies of arcade chips just connected a different way. In the guide you need to be aware of some terminology. If I use the word system it means the computer or console system being emulated. If I use the word BIOS it is meant to be for system roms or BIOS images used to get MESS working. Finally if I use the word software it means the rom/tape/disk etc… image to be loaded onto the system running in MESS.

Older news, but thenatus pointed out the update. From the Project 64 blog: Make sure current dir is base folder (not screenshot) Initialize eeprom to 0xFF instead of 0x00 Add LL and SC to Analyze Instruction ignore 0x0407000D as an opcode in analysis Make it easier for plugins to read directories from the emu fix per game rsp plugin updated rdb file Glide64: Added version to the installer Get Settings to go through the emulator Get Glide64, GlideHQ, Glitch64 to be a single dll Read texture directory from emulator Fix up getting functions from texture lib Input Plugin: Update to 1.7.0.12 provided by squall MADrigal's Simulators have a few updates - Pac Man (Tomy) and Donkey Kong (Coleco - tabletop) Stella release 3.9.2 for Linux, MacOS X and Windows is now available. Improved parsing of the DASM lst file for the debugger disassembly; it sometimes missed constant declarations. Changed 'usemouse' argument from a true/false option to accept 'always', 'analog' and 'never'. This allows to use the mouse as a controller under more specific circumstances. The default is 'analog', which means the mouse is only used to emulate analog-like devices (paddles, trackball, etc). Added ability to use bold fonts within the debugger window, which can be set with the 'dbg.fontstyle' commandline argument as well as in the debugger UI Settings dialog. This is useful for those that find the current font too narrow. Renamed 'debuggerres' argument to 'dbg.res'. All future debugger- specific options will start with 'dbg.'. The TIA 'zoom' area in the debugger now supports scrolling the mouse wheel (currently up/down only, as I don't have a sideways scrolling mouse to test with). -Have fun!

Here's a list of what's new: A small bug concerning how VB deals with registry accesses on Win7 64Bit, causing a \"Runtime error 13\". More specifically the part that recalls the last window positions. Added in some type conversion function calls and reports fixed the problem. A few minor adjustments here and there. Removed the 32bps option and a warning will issue if you attempt to set a sample rate above 48Khz. This is a limitation of uematsu.dll, not JCOM-SPC or SNESAPU.dll. Removed the code for the REALMagic remote control and a few other cosmetic bits. The upshot of this is that JCOM-SPC should run with the plain vanilla VB6 runtime which is supplied by default with pretty much every version of windows since XP. NO MORE RUNTIMER!!! Also JCOM-SPC is now pretty much Windows user profile safe. Debug logging is now written to the current user's My Documents folder as \"JCOM-SPC-LOG.txt\" and any temporary files get generated in the current user's TEMP folder. This will be the last version of the this codebase. Development on a brand new from scratch JCOM-SPC is slowly in progress. Emphasis on slowly... You can grab it at our JCOM-SPC download page . Thanks to Hojo Norem for the news. read comments (0) Sega Megadrive/Genesis VGM Player 162 days ago posted by Montie2k Sega Megadrive/Genesis VGM Player plays VGM files on the real machine (after conversion to optimised format).

Add new comment Email Details Multiple Platform What's New : - Added emulation support for the tape drive, and .CAS files loaded into the tape. Raw audio files in the .WAV format are not supported by the emulator directly, but two external programs "wav2cas" and "cas2wav" can convert between them. - Added an additional rendering mode for the X11 video system of Linux machines. Instead of drawing the emulated screen on the display rectangle by rectangle, the "xvideo" mode uses the xv extension of X11 to render into an off-screen memory which is then merged into the screen by the video overlay mechanis of the hardware. This rendering mode may create a smoother display and may improve performance on lower end hardware, but is not necessarily available everywhere. - A complete manual of Os++, including a memory map, is now available as download. - Included the Os++ system disk, including disk-based utilities around Os++ including a Dos overlay manager that relocates Dos buffers behind the cartridge, an RS232 handler, an updated version of DISKIO, a disk-based tape handler, a menu based DUP and a lot of tools.

A Second Christmas Morning: The Console Living Room 26 December 2013 For a generation of children, the most exciting part of a Christmas morning was discovering a large box under the tree, ripping it apart, and looking at an exciting, colorful box promising endless video games. At home! Right in your living room! The expansion of videogames from arcades, boardwalks and carnivals into the home was a vanguard mounted by companies with names like Coleco, Atari, Magnavox and Odyssey. For hundreds of dollars, you could play as many games as you wanted, for as long as you wanted, on the same TV you watched shows on. The change from the fireplace to television as center of home and hearth began in the 1950s and the home video game sped this process up considerably. Naturally, these home video games, running on underpowered hardware and not-made-for-the-purpose video screens, were scant competition in the graphics and experience department compared to arcade games. But as they improved, consoles and computer gaming dented and some would argue destroyed arcades as a nationwide phenomenon. Only a small percentage of arcades now exist compared to their peak. Sadly, the days of the home videogame console being a present under a tree followed by days of indulgent game-playing are not the same, replaced with massive launch events and overnight big-box store stays. Until today! In an expansion of the Historical Software Collection, the Internet Archive has opened the Console Living Room , a collection of console video games from the 1970s and 1980s. Like the Historical Software collection, the Console Living Room is in beta the ability to interact with software in near-instantaneous real-time comes with the occasional bumps and bruises. An army of volunteer elves are updating information about each of the hundreds of game cartridges now available, and will be improving them across the next few days. Sound is still not enabled, but is coming soon. Faster, more modern machines and up-to-date browsers work best with the JSMESS emulator. ... Hard Core Rikki Leaked video of Playstation 4 interface 08 Aug 2013 Gaming and Tech News [/gtech] It appears within the last 24 hours that leaked footage of the PS4 interface has appeared online. It seems to be from an early test kit, so the final version in stores may be slightly different. Nonetheless, it's pretty cool to see how it's going to look like.

Opinion: Oculus Ridiculous, My Take on the Oculus Rift 27 Jul 2013 Gaming and Tech News [/gtech] already have a Virtual Boy emulator now for Oculus Rift development kits . But, perhaps it was a fluke? Just poorly designed hardware for a damn good concept? At the moment, Sony and Microsoft seem to believe this, as we might see VR headsets in the near future with the XBOX ONE and PS4 . only game that fully supports it is Team Fortress 2 . Custom PC (UK Magazine) , you will need a hefty graphics card to run a game with Oculus Rift. Your GPU will have to be able to run the newest games at least at 60FPS with V-Sync and Stereoscopic 3D enabled. up this in the final consumer version, but there isn't even a release date set. right now at its full potential ... how much would it cost? Maybe... 2014 . if you use it for 3D porn, with penis sensor capabilities (I'm not joking) . [ ADDED : It's also very bothering with the reports of numerous people feeling nauseous / motion sickness [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] after limited (5-10 minutes) to extended usage of the Oculus Rift. The good news is Oculus VR (company behind Oculus Rift) has taken extensive note of this and has called upon game developers to try to work on adjusting their games accordingly to limit this , but even they admit it may be impossible to completely eradicate it.] Alpha 2013-07-26 New Files Added To Downloads Section 26 Jul 2013 1Emulation.com Information [/info] Our staff has been hard at work adding more emulators to our downloads section.
