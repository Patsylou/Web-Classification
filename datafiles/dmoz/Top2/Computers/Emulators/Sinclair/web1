If so, try hitting your browser's Refresh button when at the banner page. I've seen this problem when using the JANET Web cache. here . Version 0.15 now has AY sound added. Feedback has generally been positive, apart from complaints that some people couldn't download it. However, I'm still just as interested to hear suggestions and bug reports as I ever was. I especially want to know if it won't run on your system, or if it crashes intermittently. It should not crash. It does not crash on my machine. If it did, I wouldn't have released it. So if it crashes, tell me. Don't just delete it and hope that I'll fix it for the next version. Understand? :-) Ability to save screenshots as Mode 27 sprites with palette. T-state counter, with 50Hz interrupt generation linked to it. 128k memory page swapping using OS_SetMemMapEntries. Emulation of the R register.
