I'm still not sure if I plan to keep working with this fork or not. Check his new site out at: http://plex86.sf.net Patch Criteria...... posted by RvnPhnx , Fri 08 Nov 2002 04:33:29 AM UTC - 2 replies If you want a good idea as to how I think about patches (and why they aren't being added to the old plex86 tree for the time being...) then you should have a look at what Linus said about how he accepts patches for his project. I think very similarly to him--except that since I am an engineer and he isn't I'm a little more worried about the bottom line: DOES IT STILL WORK RIGHT? http://www.lib.uaa.alaska.edu/linux-kernel/archive/2002-Week-44/0094.html Old site is down.... posted by RvnPhnx , Mon 07 Oct 2002 02:30:40 AM UTC - 2 replies The old plex86 web site is no more. I was wondering how long it would take for them to take it down, but it is now--the wondering is over. In any case, this is where the work happens--so be it. I have the old cvs still, in case anybody wants to play with it. I may get it posted here, and then branched/modularized, etc.--but the development is going to focus more on the plex86-release stuff for now.

 Serenity Virtual Search Primary Menu Skip to content Sample Page Search for: Personal Experiance With The NONO Device February 25, 2014 serenity I wanted to bring my personal experience on the No NO Hair Removal . Personally, it is the facial hair that I have a problem. So I bought a no no on ebay (used) and I use it strictly for a little over three months. Honestly, the hair on my face disappeared more than half and the hairs that grow back are finer. At first, it is true the NONO Hair Removal Product that we saw the black hair cut flush on my face, but as and applications, it finally disappeared leaving a net face. I said that I was waxing takes 2 minutes three times per week for 3 weeks, then 1 time a week and now its once a fortnight (and again, because I am a stickler).
