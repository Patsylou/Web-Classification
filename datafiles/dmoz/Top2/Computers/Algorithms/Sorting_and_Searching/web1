 ANSI C implementation of a Suffix Tree What you will find in this page The Suffix Tree data structure [1] Definition A suffix tree T for an m -character string S is a rooted directed tree with exactly m leaves numbered 1 to m . Each internal node, other than the root, has at least two children and each edge is labeled with a nonempty substring of S . No two edges out of a node can have edge-labels beginning with the same character. The key feature of the suffix tree is that for any leaf i , the concatenation of the edge-labels on the path from the root to leaf i exactly spells out the suffix of S that starts at position i . That is, it spells out S [ i .. m Authors and maintainers Shlomo Yona Offer Kaye TODO Compilation make Makefile Files Project report summary README The original project report Dotan wrote project_report.rtf The header file suffix_tree.h The implementation file suffix_tree.c A simple example of using the code as through the interface as_is_example.c A main.c for the Makefile: main.c The Makefile Makefile suffix_tree.tar.gz SuffixTree-0.03 POD SuffixTree-0.03.tar.gz SuffixTree-0.02.tar.gz SuffixTree-0.01.tar.gz here here click here to read Belorussian translation (provided by Webhostingrating License References Shlomo Yona 
 Search algorithm From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia navigation ,       search In computer science , a search algorithm is an algorithm for finding an item with specified properties among a collection of items. The items may be stored individually as records in a database ; or may be elements of a search space defined by a mathematical formula or procedure, such as the roots of an equation with integer variables ; or a combination of the two, such as the Hamiltonian circuits of a graph . Contents 1 Classes of search algorithms 1.1 For virtual search spaces 1.2 For sub-structures of a given structure 1.3 Search for the maximum of a function 1.4 For quantum computers 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Classes of search algorithms [ edit ] For virtual search spaces [ edit ] Algorithms for searching virtual spaces are used in constraint satisfaction problem , where the goal is to find a set of value assignments to certain variables that will satisfy specific mathematical equations and inequations . They are also used when the goal is to find a variable assignment that will maximize or minimize a certain function of those variables. Algorithms for these problems include the basic brute-force search (also called "naïve" or "uninformed" search), and a variety of heuristics that try to exploit partial knowledge about structure of the space, such as linear relaxation , constraint generation , and constraint propagation . An important subclass are the local search methods, that view the elements of the search space as the vertices of a graph, with edges defined by a set of heuristics applicable to the case; and scan the space by moving from item to item along the edges, for example according to the steepest descent or best-first criterion, or in a stochastic search . This category includes a great variety of general metaheuristic methods, such as simulated annealing , tabu search , A-teams, and genetic programming , that combine arbitrary heuristics in specific ways. This class also includes various tree search algorithms , that view the elements as vertices of a tree , and traverse that tree in some special order. Examples of the latter include the exhaustive methods such as depth-first search and breadth-first search , as well as various heuristic-based search tree pruning methods such as backtracking and branch and bound . Unlike general metaheuristics, which at best work only in a probabilistic sense, many of these tree-search methods are guaranteed to find the exact or optimal solution, if given enough time. Another important sub-class consists of algorithms for exploring the game tree of multiple-player games, such as chess or backgammon , whose nodes consist of all possible game situations that could result from the current situation. The goal in these problems is to find the move that provides the best chance of a win, taking into account all possible moves of the opponent(s). Similar problems occur when humans or machines have to make successive decisions whose outcomes are not entirely under one's control, such as in robot guidance or in marketing , financial or military strategy planning. This kind of problem - combinatorial search - has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence . Examples of algorithms for this class are the minimax algorithm , alpha-beta pruning , and the A* algorithm . For sub-structures of a given structure [ edit ] The name combinatorial search is generally used for algorithms that look for a specific sub-structure of a given discrete structure , such as a graph, a string , a finite group , and so on. The term combinatorial optimization is typically used when the goal is to find a sub-structure with a maximum (or minimum) value of some parameter. (Since the sub-structure is usually represented in the computer by a set of integer variables with constraints, these problems can be viewed as special cases of constraint satisfaction or discrete optimization; but they are usually formulated and solved in a more abstract setting where the internal representation is not explicitly mentioned.) An important and extensively studied subclass are the graph algorithms , in particular graph traversal algorithms, for finding specific sub-structures in a given graph — such as subgraphs , paths , circuits , and so on. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm , Kruskal's algorithm , the nearest neighbour algorithm , and Prim's algorithm . Another important subclass of this category are the string searching algorithms , that search for patterns within strings. Two famous examples are the Boyer–Moore and Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithms , and several algorithms based on the suffix tree data structure. Search for the maximum of a function [ edit ] In 1953 J. Kiefer devised Fibonacci search which can be used to find the maximum of a unimodal function and has many other applications in computer science. For quantum computers [ edit ] There are also search methods designed for quantum computers , like Grover's algorithm , that are theoretically faster than linear or brute-force search even without the help of data structures or heuristics.

 Thursday, January 20, 2005 Peter Weigel and Andreas Boltzmann did a really nice job on visualizing the internal workings of different sorting algorithms . Their simulation also indicates the huge performance penalties of O(N^2) complexity approaches (e.g. Bubblesort) in comparison to O(N * log(N)) complexity (e.g. Quicksort). The original implementation consisted of a Java top-level Window with German localization, so I did a quick hack and threw it all into an applet container, as well as translating it to English. Email This BlogThis!

 String searching algorithm From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia navigation ,       search In computer science , string searching algorithms , sometimes called string matching algorithms , are an important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns ) are found within a larger string or text. Let Σ be an alphabet ( finite set ). Formally, both the pattern and searched text are vectors of elements of Σ. The Σ may be a usual human alphabet (for example, the letters A through Z in the Latin alphabet). Other applications may use binary alphabet (Σ = {0,1}) or DNA alphabet (Σ = {A,C,G,T}) in bioinformatics . In practice, how the string is encoded can affect the feasible string search algorithms. In particular if a variable width encoding is in use then it is slow (time proportional to N) to find the Nth character. This will significantly slow down many of the more advanced search algorithms. A possible solution is to search for the sequence of code units instead, but doing so may produce false matches unless the encoding is specifically designed to avoid it.

Single pattern algorithms [ edit ] Let m be the length of the pattern and let n be the length of the searchable text.

[ 1 ] Algorithms using a finite set of patterns [ edit ] Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm Commentz-Walter algorithm Rabin–Karp string search algorithm Algorithms using an infinite number of patterns [ edit ] Naturally, the patterns can not be enumerated in this case. They are represented usually by a regular grammar or regular expression . Other classification [ edit ] This section does not cite any references or sources .

One of the most common uses preprocessing as main criteria.

So first we see if there's a copy of the needle in the first character of the haystack; if not, we look to see if there's a copy of the needle starting at the second character of the haystack; if not, we look starting at the third character, and so forth. In the normal case, we only have to look at one or two characters for each wrong position to see that it is a wrong position, so in the average case, this takes O ( n + m ) steps, where n is the length of the haystack and m is the length of the needle; but in the worst case, searching for a string like "aaaab" in a string like "aaaaaaaaab", it takes O ( nm ) Finite state automaton based search [ edit ] In this approach, we avoid backtracking by constructing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes stored search string. These are expensive to construct—they are usually created using the powerset construction —but are very quick to use. For example, Stubs [ edit ] Knuth–Morris–Pratt computes a DFA that recognizes inputs with the string to search for as a suffix, Boyer–Moore starts searching from the end of the needle, so it can usually jump ahead a whole needle-length at each step. Baeza–Yates keeps track of whether the previous j characters were a prefix of the search string, and is therefore adaptable to fuzzy string searching . The bitap algorithm is an application of Baeza–Yates' approach. Index methods [ edit ] Faster search algorithms are based on preprocessing of the text. After building a substring index , for example a suffix tree or suffix array , the occurrences of a pattern can be found quickly. As an example, a suffix tree can be built in time, and all occurrences of a pattern can be found in time under the assumption that the alphabet has a constant size and all inner nodes in the suffix tree knows what leafs are underneath them. The latter can be accomplished by running a DFS algorithm from the root of the suffix tree. Other variants [ edit ] Some search methods, for instance trigram search , are intended to find a "closeness" score between the search string and the text rather than a "match/non-match". These are sometimes called "fuzzy" searches .
