Its subject is at the interface between mathematics and theoretical computer science, with a clear mathematical profile and strictly mathematical format. The central topics are: Models of computation, complexity bounds (with particular emphasis on lower bounds), complexity classes, trade-off results for sequential and parallel computation for "general" (Boolean) and "structured" computation (e.g. decision trees, arithmetic circuits) for deterministic, probabilistic, and nondeterministic computation worst case and average case Specific areas of concentration include: Structure of complexity classes (reductions, relativization questions, degrees, derandomization) Algebraic complexity (bilinear complexity, computations for polynomials, groups, algebras, and representations) Cryptography, interactive proofs, pseudorandom generation Complexity issues in: learning theory number theory logic (complexity of logical theories, cost of decision procedures) combinatorial optimization and approximate solutions distributed computing Bibliographic Data comput. complex.

The journal is completely free for both authors and readers. Authors retain the copyright of their articles. Articles published in E-JC are reviewed on MathSciNet and ZBMath, and are indexed by Web of Science. Â The latest papers are always available by clicking on the tab marked "Current" near the top of the page. You can also locate papers using the search facility on the right hand side of this page. E-JC was founded in 1994 by Herbert S. Wilf and Neil Calkin, making it one of the oldest electronic journals.

The journal provides a forum for research in the algorithmic treatment of all types of symbolic objects : objects in formal languages (terms, formulas, programs); algebraic objects (elements in basic number domains, polynomials, residue classes, etc.); and geometrical objects. It is the explicit goal of the journal to promote the integration of symbolic computation by establishing one common avenue of communication for researchers working in the different subareas. It is also important that the algorithmic achievements of these areas should be made available to the human problem-solver in integrated software systems for symbolic computation. To help this integration, the journal publishes invited tutorial surveys as well as Applications Letters and System Descriptions. Research Areas Include: Computational algebra Computational geometry (non-linear) Automated theorem proving Automatic programming Design and implementation of symbolic computation languages and systems Applications in education, science, engineering and industry Benefits to authors We also provide many author benefits, such as free PDFs, a liberal copyright policy, special discounts on Elsevier publications and much more.
