 Card No.: Pos. No.: by mouseclick automatically delay (in ms) Backtracking A mouseclick on any card belonging to the array on the right side ("pool") moves that card into the next empty field of the left array ("game-area"). A single mouseclick on any card in the game-area causes a quarter turn of the card counterclockwise. Aim "new solution" H.B.
