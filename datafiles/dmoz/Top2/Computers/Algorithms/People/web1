Students Teaching Biography Contact Home Info Big data analytics systems, to be useful, require high performance computing. For example, Google's data analytics systems require processor clusters that fill large factory halls. My research program is focused on improving the performance of big data analytics systems, in particular for business intelligence and computational biochemistry , through efficient  parallel computing methods for multi-core processors, GPUs, processor clusters and clouds. Current Projects Parallel Big Data Analytics For Business Intelligence : Real-time online analytical processing (OLAP) for multi-core and cloud architectures. Parallel Big Data Analytics For Computational Biochemistry : Protein-protein interaction networks. Parallel Computing Methods : Auto-tuned parallel software for multi-core processors, GPUs, clusters clouds.   Research supported by Parallel Computing Data Science Research Lab School of Computer Science   Jan. 1, 2014 - New Compute Canada resource allocation grant ( 5400 core years = $1,890,000). Nov. 1, 2013 - SOSCIP 's board approves access to  BlueGene/Q (32,768 processor cores) for our new proteome analytics project. Oct. 5-9, 2013 - New paper on real-time OLAP for cloud architectures published at IEEE BigData 2013 in California. June 1, 2013 - Official start of our second  IBM Canada funded parallel big data analytics project (3 years). Apr. 16, 2013 - New NSERC equipment grant to expand our lab cluster . Nov. 6, 2012 - IBM Canada "Innovation Impact of the Year" Award for our work on parallel real-time data analytics. Weekly Bioinformatics Group meetings (room 6210 VSIM).
