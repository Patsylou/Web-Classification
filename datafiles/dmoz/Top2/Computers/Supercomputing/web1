Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing and Institutional RD Programs As part of NNSA's mission to extend the lifetime of nuclear weapons in the stockpile, the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign provides NNSA with leading edge, high-end simulation capabilities. The ASC program helps NNSA to meet nuclear weapons assessment and certification requirements, including: weapon codes, weapon science, computing platforms, and supporting infrastructure. NNSA's national laboratories house some of the world's fastest supercomputers: Sequoia and Cielo . ASC simulations are central to U.S. national security, as they provide a computational surrogate for nuclear testing. NNSA's ability to model the extraordinary complexity of nuclear weapons systems is essential to establish confidence in the performance of our aging stockpile. ASC tools enable nuclear weapons scientists and engineers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire weapons lifecycle from design to safe processes for dismantlement. Also, through close coordination with other government agencies, ASC tools also play an important role in supporting nonproliferation efforts, emergency response, and nuclear forensics.

Isn't that nice opens Prof. Dr. Hans Meuer in his opening adress to his audience of some 160 highly interested listeners. Few minutes later keynote speaker Prof. Dr. Dan Reed of Microsoft takes it away. Windows democratized the computer at home, cloud computing will democratize the internet of things. Expectations are that corporate spendings alone in cloud computing will increase 8-fold within three years. Some thousand SME's will rise to the occasion, and this might result in up to 100.000 new jobs or more. Yes, the atmosphere is rather optimistic. In later presentations it was said and confirmed that "the ship has sailed". Everybody agrees: cloud computing is a fact that cannot be ignored any longer. Hence the ESC's spin-off programming of this cloud conference. It appears to be a wise and widely welcomed decision. Many of the speakers investigate the compatibility of high performance computing and clouds, others zoom in to the opportunities for corporations to incorporate public clouds into their ICT frame of mind. Or better: the need thereoff, as it appears to be the only logical solution to the recognized data-deluge. And so, technical, juridicial, practical, commercial, security and many other issues are addressed, but only few answers followed. Cloud computing is as inevitable as it is irresistible. And it's not ready yet. There's so much more to ponder.
