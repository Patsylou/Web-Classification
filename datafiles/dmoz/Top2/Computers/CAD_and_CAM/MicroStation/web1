It performs its magic regardless of whether you work in 2D or 3D. The DGN element information (along with other usable stuff) is gathered and displayed at cursor position, in contrast to standard MicroStation GUI that scatters bits and pieces of information all over the place. Equally easy is to apply this information to MicroStation active symbology, settings, etc. just by hitting a single key. InfoGlider is a transparent, background utility that gives you the whole new way to see the surrounding MicroStation context of your actions, by displaying information at your cursor. You should see your productivity raising right away. No kidding... Legacy Gem IV: RobsToys v1.0 (by Rob Brown) Two things to make your accudraw experience a little merrier. Or at least a bit less annoying. The first is the much requested "put accudraw on hold" thing. The second is shortcut for "Rotate to Element".
