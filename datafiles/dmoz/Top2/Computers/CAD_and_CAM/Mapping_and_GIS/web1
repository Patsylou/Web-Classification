Toward OpenLayers 3! OpenLayers 3 WebGL promises to bring 3D capabilities and increased performance for all mapping needs to the latest browsers. OpenLayers 3.0 will offer WebGL, while degrading nicely in less capable browsers. Cesium : The OpenLayers community will also integrate the new Cesium library to enable full 3D spinning globe capabilities directly into the 3.0 release. Closure Compiler : By utilizing the Closure Compiler, applications developers will be able to create smaller and faster libraries, easing the use of the extensive OpenLayers 3.0 toolkit. A new codebase : This offers an opportunity to clean up some of the “clunky” ways of doing things in OpenLayers. The team will also create with new API designs, which will be more accessible to all. High-quality documentation : The new release will also feature documentation with fresh examples and default designs in OpenLayers 3.0. Making a toolkit standout is about more than the actual code. http://www.indiegogo.com/ol3 , read our blog post $5,000: Your organization’s logo will appear on the OpenLayers 3.0 Thank You page. $25,000: A 1 year OpenLayers support package with two named users. $40,000: Logo and link will appear on the OpenLayers homepage as a "Sustaining Sponsor", as well as at the top of the OpenLayers 3.0 Thank You page. $75,000: A 1 year OpenLayers enterprise support package, with up to 8 named users, and "Sustaining Sponsor" logos and credits. ol3-funding [at] googlegroups.com For Developers!
