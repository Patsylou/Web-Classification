Todays CAD Society is a way for users to have an industry voice that is related to all the CAD products, industry-wide and across the entire globe. The CAD Society is global: It is created to be appropriate to users of every level: students, users of every level, vendors, developers and pundits. And we are currently freshening up the CAD Society web site to reflect its expanded mission to all members, everywhere. Join the CAD Society Now!! Being a member of the CAD Society has its benefits!

Are you concerned about the decline in qualified engineers in your region? We are, and feel that promoting engineering is of the utmost importance at every level - local schools through to federal government. The CAD Society is working hard to develop volunteer programs that promote engineering and design in all its forms. And even if you have just one spare hour in a month, or a few spare hours per week, you can make a difference. Find out more about volunteering But wait! Theres more!
