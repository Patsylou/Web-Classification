 Gdel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid / Douglas R. Hofstadter Reviewed by Tal Cohen Friday, 30 May 1997 (For a review of the what's new in the “20th Anniversary Edition”, click here .) Writing a book is an art. However, this normally does not refer to nonfiction books, especially scientific ones. Douglas R. Hofstadter's literary marvel is the exception. It is a philosophy book that reads like music, a work of art that many consider second to none. Gdel, Escher, Bach ( GEB ) debates the question of consciousness and the possibility of artificial intelligence. It is a book that attempts to discover what “self” really means. Introducing the reader to cognitive science, Gdel, Escher, Bach draws heavily from art to illustrate fine points in mathematics. The works of M.C. Escher and J.S. Bach are discussed, in addition to other works of art and music. The topics presented range from mathematics and meta-mathematics to programming, recursion (in math as well as in computing), formal systems, multilevel systems, self reference, self representation, and others. Before each of GEB 's twenty chapters, Hofstadter includes a dialogue, in which Achilles, the Tortoise, and their company discuss various aspects that will later be examined by the author in the chapter to follow. In writing those dialogues, Hofstadter created a whole new form of art. Concepts are presented by the dialogues on two different levels, simultaneously: form and content . The more obvious level, that of content, presents each idea directly, by providing the views of the merry band -- sometimes right, often wrong, and always funny. The true joy, however, lies in discovering the way in which Hofstadter interweaves the very same ideas into the physical form of the dialogue. The form deals with the same mathematical concepts discussed by the characters, and reminds the reader of the musical pieces by Bach and printed works by Escher that the characters mention directly in their talks. A simple example is the dialogue preceding Chapter III. Called “ Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles ”, this dialogue directly quotes only one character, Achilles, while he converses over the phone with his friend the Tortoise. They talk about the mathematical notion of figure and ground: how, by defining one subset of a given set, you implicitly define another subset of that same set -- the part that is not included in the first subset. In the visual arts, this is best exemplified by Escher's Mosaic lithographs, where the shapes that form the background for a group of black “phantasmagorical beasts” define another set of figures, in white. The musical example that Hofstadter uses is Bach's Sonatas for Unaccompanied Violin, where the listeners' imagination fill in “between the notes” as the violin plays, and one often imagines hearing the accompanying piano. But the form of the dialogue pulls the very same trick, as the reader can easily imagine the Tortoise answering Achilles at the other end of the line! Part of Mosaic II by M.C. Escher Another example is the “ Crab Canon ”, preceding Chapter VIII. This short but highly amusing piece can be read, much like the notes of Bach's Crab Canon , in either direction -- from start to finish or from finish to start, resulting in the very same text. Fiendishly complex to write (or translate), the artistic beauty of that dialogue at least equals that of Bach's piece or Escher's drawing of the same name. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Other issues discussed in GEB include, for example, self-reference and self-representation, both of which Hofstadter considers to be crucial parts of any attempt to understand what intelligence really is. Self-reference (self-ref for short) is the notion of an object, physical or conceptual, that references its own self in some manner. A person talking about himself, or even just pointing at himself, is self-referencing. Another simple instance of self-reference is the one-line paradox: “ This Sentence is False ”. It is easy to see that texts that reference themselves, even if they are as short as the example cited above, can lead to amusing or paradoxical results. Self-representation (self-rep), on the other hand, is the more complex notion of an object that includes, within itself, a complete representation of itself. This is more complicated to achieve, but one easy to grasp example would be a mirror facing another mirror. Each of these mirrors contains a complete representation of itself (in fact, it contains an infinite number of such complete self-representations, each smaller than the other). By playing around in an amusing manner with these, and many other, mathematical concepts, Hofstadter slowly and gently introduces the reader to more advanced mathematical ideas, like formal systems, the Church-Turing Thesis, Turing's Halting Problem and (eventually) Gdel's Incompleteness Theorem. GEB discusses some very serious matters, and it is not an easy book to tackle. However, it is very enjoyable to read, as Hofstadter augments each subject with examples from very diverse sources. The joy of discovering the puns and other playful gems hidden in the book is part of what makes it so special. Anecdotes, word plays and Zen koans are additional aspects that help make GEB 's 777 pages an experience that many readers consider to be a turning point in their lives. Like every other book published by Hofstadter, GEB has an index and a bibliography that must be noted as exceptionally well done. It is interesting to note that while GEB is full of English wordplay, it is in no way tied to the American origin of its author. For years, the book was considered “impossible to translate”, but the first translation (to French, done by Robert French and Jacqueline Henry with the help of Hofstadter himself and published in 1985) opened the gate to a flood of additional translations. So far, GEB was translated into French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian and Russian. In his latest book, Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language ( reviewed here ), Hofstadter discusses translations of GEB and the art of translation in general. It is not, however, merely a book about translation, as it might appear at first glance. Some of the humor in GEB is really well-hidden. Check out the Book In-Jokes page for details about some of it, as well as many humoristic gems from other books. Find this book using Wikipedia Also by Douglas R. Hofstadter Hofstadter's latest book, Le Ton beau de Marot ( reviewed here ), is in many ways a work of art, similar to GEB . It also deals with the subject of “self”, though it approaches it from a different angle. Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern is a collection of Hofstadter's monthly “Metamagical Themas” column in Scientific American during the early '80s. Co-edited with Daniel C. Dennett, The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul is a collection of essays by noted writers about self and soul. Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought , written with the Fluid Analogies Research Group, includes a serious discussion of Hofstadter's research work.

 Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language / Douglas R. Hofstadter Reviewed by Tal Cohen Wednesday, 30 September 1998 Gdel, Escher, Bach (“ GEB ”, reviewed here ): chapters interwoven with brief sections of artistic playfulness. Each chapter elaborates on the themes presented in the interlude preceding it. In GEB , the interludes were dialogs between imaginary characters; in Le Ton beau de Marot , they are dozens of variations and translations (written by Hofstdter, friends, and family members) of a single ancient French poem. The poem is called “ A une Damoyselle malade ” (“To a Sick Damsel”), originally written by Clement Marot. At first glance, Le Ton beau de Marot is a book about the art of translation, written by a computer scientist. However, this is a mistaken view. The book is, like most of Hofstadter's previous works, a discussion of the nature of consciousness, the meaning of “self”, and the possibility of artificial intelligence, which is the author's subject of research. It is simply that this book takes on the subject from a different angle, focusing initially on linguistic issues. Hofstadter was apparently drawn into the world of translation when the first attempts were made to translate GEB to French, German, and other languages. Being fluent in several languages (he describes himself as “Pilingual”, fluent in Pi languages), the author took an active part in the various translation efforts. In GEB , the relation between languages, translation and the nature of the human mind was discussed in the dialogue “ English, French, German Suite ” and the following chapter (XII). In some ways, this work can be viewed as an elaboration of the theme. When I tackle a translating challenge, it is not in the least because I yearn to reveal to the poor deprived non-speakers of language X the hidden structure and meaning of some intricate passage in language X -- no, for me, translating is simply the sheer joy of trying to do something deeply paradoxical: namely, to carry off in medium 2, radically different from medium 1, some virtuoso stunt that someone else once carried off with great aplomb in medium 1. That's all, no more. It's just a game, an exercise in creativity, a challenge that, if met with sufficient flair, provides a wonderful esthetic reward. Probably the most important claim about poetry and poetry translation presented in the book is that in a poem, the form is just as important as, if not more important than, the content. At times, however, it seems like the author takes the extreme view of attributing form with a level of importance that shadows that of content. I would consider some of the suggested translations for “ A une Damoyselle malade ” to be new poems influenced by, rather than translations of, the French original. But the battle between form and content rages not only within the boundaries of translating that single poem. In some of GEB 's dialogues (perhaps most noticeably the “ Crab Canon ”), Hofstadter gave greater priority to form, altering content to fit its needs. Most readers will agree that this was an acceptable artistic choice. However, in GEB 's chapters (as opposed to dialogues), form hardly had an effect on content. In contrast, in Le Ton beau de Marot , Hofstadter admits to have taken great pains to perfect the typographical layout of the pages. At times, the result is most pleasing (see, for example, the passage from The Catcher in the Rye , pp. 282-283), but in general, I personally find no place for typographical issues having such a large impact on a book's content. As a book about translation, Le Ton beau de Marot is sourly lacking. The decision to translate a single poem over and over again, while interesting, has imposed some limitations on the discussion. The poem is cute, and presents the would-be translator with several fascinating challenges, but these are by no means all the challenges a translator faces. Some issues in translation, like the translation of metaphors across different cultures, are hardly discussed (even within the context of “trans-culturization”). Yet as a book about AI for non-professionals, it is highly refreshing and entertaining, especially because of the unusual approach taken. Indeed, one of my purposes in drawing together this book's sampler of sparklingly diverse translations of one tiny poem was to issue a clear reminder of how subtle and complex the human mind really is. I hope thereby to convey the attitude that in AI and MT [Machine Translation] , one should not expect full success overnight -- nor should anyone want it. Some aspects directly related to AI appear early in the book. For example, Hofstadter's “arch-enemy” John Searle (inventor of the Chinese Room experiment) is attacked as early as the fourth chapter. However, the book begins to shine only on Chapter 15, “ On the Ununderstandable ”, which begins a beautiful discussion of the real issues at hand. One of the more interesting hypotheses presented in this discussion is the idea of identity-blurring and the “interpenetration of souls”. The claim presented is that each “self”, each “soul” if you wish to use that term, is not necessarily bound to a single physical brain; rather, it is distributed among several brains. Thus, in a way, when one physical brain ceases to exist, the person (or at least parts of him) still lives, in the brains of others. The idea certainly sounds poetic. Hofstadter realizes some people might claim the theory was developed as part of his attempt to cope with his beloved wife's death, but he points to some of his publications, predating her sudden death, which presented essentially the same idea. Two experts, to explicate Meaning, Penned a text called “The Meaning of Meaning”, But the world was perplexed, So three experts penned next “The Meaning of Meaning of Meaning”. On the book's back cover, Daniel Dennett claims that for years, Douglas Hofstadter “has been studying the process of his own consciousness, relentlessly, unflinchingly, imaginatively, but undeludedly”. It seems that of special importance is Hofstadter's ongoing research of his own mistakes and linguistic slip-ups, leading to some profound insights. Find this book using Wikipedia A Word about Hebrew Words Hofstadter claims that “ Hebrew [...] has valiantly sought to resist the influx of Western words for all sorts of things ” (p. 295). He goes on to say that “ there exists an official council in Israel that is charged with concocting official pure-Hebrew expressions ” for some words, and he provides a list of fifty “Western” words like electricity, racism, tin can, can opener, and junk-food as an example. Of the list provided, more than one fourth have no Hebrew terms in actual use . For example, the word Hebrew speakers use for “radio” is simply “radio” (naturally, pronounced slightly differently in Hebrew than in English). One has to remember that the Hebrew language was revived rather recently, after several centuries of no daily use. It was revived in a heroic effort generally attributed to a single person, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda , which had to come up with numerous words to use in daily conversation. But since there already are Hebrew words for “tin”, “can” and “opener”, I see no point in using non-Hebrew terms for “tin can” or “can opener” (which are some of the examples Hofstadter provides). Other words in Hofstadter's list originate from ancient Biblical Hebrew. For example, the word for “race” originates in the Bible; it is only natural that that word would be used as the base form for “racism.” New Reviews Notification the RSS feed .

Hofstadter Basic Books, 632 pages, $30 Connection, linkage: this is the great task of modernist aesthetics. Only connect! thinks a character in E. M. Forsters Howards End . The ordinary man, reports T. S. Eliot, falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes. Douglas Hofstadterbest known as the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning intellectual fantasia Gdel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is an enthusiastic adherent of this tradition. Perhaps too enthusiastic. In Gdel, Escher, Bach , Hofstadter used three figures from different intellectual disciplinesmathematics, graphic art, and musical compositionto anchor a series of reflections on such recursive structures as Mbius strips and iterated algorithms, such self-referential statements as the statement This statement is false, and the possibility of building intelligent computers. (By profession a computer scientist, Hofstadter is a leading figure in the quest for artificial intelligence.) One of the minor themes of Gdel, Escher, Bach is translation: What does it mean to translate something from one language into another? Can Lewis Carrolls be translated? If so, what would be the French for Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe? This new book, Le Ton Beau de Marot , takes up the question of translation in more detail. Several years ago, Hofstadter became interested in a slight, short poem, Ma Mignonne, by the sixteenth-century French poet Clment Marot, and started wondering how it might best be translated into English. What was essential to preserve in translation, and what could be dispensed with? Hofstadter sent a copy of the poem, plus his own literal translation and an enumeration of what he felt to be the key features of the poems structure, to fifty, perhaps even a hundred, friends scattered around the globe. Dispersed throughout this enormous book are the responses of those friends, along with almost fifty different translations of the poem. Clearly Hofstadter saw the text of Ma Mignonne as anchoring his reflections about translation in the same way that the works of Kurt Gdel, M. C. Escher, and Johann Sebastian Bach anchored his thoughts about self-reference in his first book. But the poem is in fact too slight to moor anything so active as Hofstadters mind, and he continually goes off on tangents that take him far, far away from the question of translatability. To be sure, polymathic digressions produce much of the charm of his writing: his excursuses on ambiguous newspaper headlines (British Left Waffles on Falklands), palindromes, dirty jokes, and various other linguistic games are funny and provocative. But when he starts telling us of his fondness for Wendys Spicy Chicken sandwiches, or explaining that, on a visit to Clment Marots home town, he bought some postcards and got his hair cut before he joined some friends for dinnerwell, one begins to wonder what editors at Basic Books do to earn their money. If readers can wade through the ephemera, however, they will discover that the key to his project, not just in this book but also in his research on cognition and artificial intelligence, may be found in a statement he cites from the mathe matician Stanislaw Ulam: What is it you see when you see? You see an object as a key, a man in a car as a passenger, some sheets of paper as a book. It is the word that must be mathematically formalized . . . . Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem. Virtually all of Hofstadters work revolves around this quest for which is why translation is so important. He directs a research program on Concepts and Cognition that focuses on analogies and creativity, for the obvious reason that the creative thinker is the one who can find the connection, the analogy, the that links the seen and known with the previously unseen and unknown. If we explore what we do when we translate a poem from one language into another, perhaps we can come to understand how analogical thinking works well enough that we can teach computers to do it. And if we can do that, thinks Hofstadter, computers will be intelligent and the quest for artificial intelligence will have succeeded. But can we do that? Hofstadter easily punctures the hubris of computer scientists who think they have already achieved that goal, but he is even more scornful of philosophers who, like John Searle, think it impossible. For Hofstadter, there is no principle that makes artificial intelligence unrealizablebut that has something to do with what he thinks human intelligence is. In Gdel, Escher, Bach , Hofstadter posits what might be called a deontological theory of consciousness, one which holds that humans think by first learning and then employing certain rules. It may seem to us that our minds arent purely but thats just an These rules that govern the mind, Hofstadter claims, express themselves through certain patterns. We recognize patterns and thereby appropriate (even if we dont fully understand) the rules that produced those patterns. Hofstadter thinks that the ability to recognize patterns lies very close to the core of intelligence, if there is such a thingand thus, since computers follow rules and rules produce patterns and the recognition of patterns is the definition of intelligence, computers can exhibit intelligence. It is not clear, of course, that mere recognition of patterns constitutes intelligence. Searle thinks it does not, and Hofstadters many pages attempting a refutation of Searle attack the illustration Searle uses rather than his point as such. itself may not be a particularly meaningful concept; Stephen Jay Gould, in The Mismeasure of Man , has done serious damage to the notion that there is a single capacity that can be called intelligence. Hofstadter makes his work a lot easier by selecting one thing that computers could plausibly be thought to possess and calling that But more important for someone who wants to understand Le Ton Beau de Marot is Hofstadters linking of patterns with rules, because that is the source of Hofstadters peculiar notion of what poetry is and what the translators of poetry have to do. He hates free verse, for example, because it follows no rules, and therefore has no patterns. (And therefore, by his own definition, must not exhibit intelligence.) This is hardly a helpful description of what William Carlos Williams in Paterson , T. S. Eliot in The Waste Land , and Ezra Pound in the Cantos were up to, writing poetry whose rich patterns exist even if they do not recur with regularity and predictability: their poems have patterns without discernible rules. Writing in traditional forms is no less creative; but the point to be made here is that human creativity sometimes involves the use of patterns that are not rule-governed, and the task of creating artificial intelligence is much harder than Hofstadter thinks. Two illustrations will help to show how difficult it is for the author to grasp the notion of patterns that deviate from rules. He has a great fondness for Vikram Seths The Golden Gate (1991), a novel in verse written entirely in a stanza derived from Aleksandr Pushkins Eugene Onegin (1831). But when Seth writes, How can I (careless of time) use / The dusty bread molds of Onegin / In the brave bakery of Reagan? Hofstadter thinks the first and third lines quoted need an extra syllable each, so he pauses to improve them: How can I (careless of fashion) use / The dusty bread molds of Onegin / In the brave new bakery of Reagan? Leaving aside the question of whether being careless of fashion is the same thing as being careless of time, we should still note that Hofstadters mechanical sense of rhythm demands that a line not have two stressed syllables in a row (time-use, brave-bake). Of course, good poets vary stresses all the time to avoid mind-numbing repetition over the length of a poemespecially a book-length poem. But if pattern-recognition is the heart of intelligence, and patterns must follow rules, then the disruption of pattern is a sin against intellect. My second illustration comes from Hofstadters impossibly long discussion of how Dante should be translated. Notwithstanding the fact, which he cheerfully admits, that he has read none of the Purgatorio or Paradiso and only some of the Inferno , he howls in outrage when he notes how few translators stick with Dantes linked terza rima in their English versions. Hofstadter cant imagine why none of the widely used translations of Dante keep to this form, and he thinks their neglect is a kind of betrayal. But the answer is simple: Italian is a very rhyme-rich language (in large part because so many of its words end in vowels), while English is rhyme-poor. The translator who reproduces in English Dantes rhyme scheme is continually forced into unnatural word order and peculiar word choice. (Compare Dorothy Sayers persistently clunky terza rima with the more flexible forms preferred by John Ciardi or Mark Musa and youll see what I mean.) For the same reason, translators of French poetry into English routinely replace the six-beat alexandrines common in French with the pentameter that suits the rhythms of English. (W. H. Auden was right to say that alexandrines always sound comic in English.) Elsewhere in the book, Hofstadter acknowledges the difficulty deciding what it means to produce a translation, but he is so insistent about how Dante should be rendered into English because the rule-governed pattern of the poets terza rima is more important than euphony, clarity, or narrative coherence. But since the pattern is perfectly accessible to people who dont know a word of Italian, why bother to translate Dante at all? Of course, Hofstadter isnt really interested in the product of the act of translation, but the act itself. He hopes, by investigating his own translations and those of his friends, to understand better how the human mind makes analogies, and thereby to forward the quest for artificial intelligence. And on the question of why we should want computers to be intelligent, he says something rather bold and surprising: Why should a race of benevolent if fleshless beings be any less worthy of being considered our s children than the potential gang of music-polluters, lyrical rapists, priest-assassins, and mob-frenzied jackbooted genocide perpetrators that might spring forth from the celestial union of my eager sperms with your equally eager ova? (Hofstadters prose isnt always this out-of-control, but often it is.) Though he mentions his children often and dedicates the book to them, he does not seem to relish turning over the world to them, and he seems more willing to trust children he made than those he begot. Here again is Hofstadters debt to modernist aesthetics: the poet (or the computer scientist) as rival creator to God. He never asks whether a group of potential genocide perpetrators is likely to create beings characterized primarily by and his hope seems to be that we can make computers intelligent by teaching them patterns and make them good by avoiding teaching them greed. And if virtue were merely the absence of vice, rather than the fruit of spiritual and moral discipline, that hope might be a believable one. Alas. One thing more. A substantial portion of this book is devoted to a kind of tributeseemingly out of place in this context, but moving nonethelessto Hofstadters late wife Carol, who died rather suddenly from a brain tumor in 1993, leaving him to raise their two young children alone. One is left wondering whether Hofstadter is perhaps envisioning computers as electronic companions who will not die and leave us behind. Hofstadter is at heart a Gnostic: he thinks of our bodies as merely the containers of our immaterial essence, and wants us to consider computers as potential children (and spouses?) because our sense of human identity should have nothing to do with our genetics and everything to do with something more abstract, something based on a certain way of thinking and feeling and caring, irrespective of the physical medium in which it [our identity] is embedded. A persons identity dies, Hofstadter thinks, because it was in an all-too-fragile physical medium. Here again God screwed up, and we will not repeat His mistakes: If the AI people get it right, our cyber-children and cyber-friends and cyber-spouses may have to grieve our passing, but we will never have to grieve theirs.
