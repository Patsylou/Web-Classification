It grew out of earlier pages at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and at GMD FIRST, snapshots of which can be found here and here . In those days, information about kernel methods was sparse and nontrivial to find, and the kernel machines web site acted as a central repository for the field. It included a list of people working in the field, and online preprints of most publications. Nowadays, this no longer makes sense, partly because the field is very popular, so there are too many people and papers to make such lists useful, and partly because search engines do the job much more conveniently. But what really forced us to do a major update of the site was the fact that spammers discovered our site, and it was no longer possible to operate a system which was built on the trust that people who submit an entry do so to improve the quality of the site.

Currently a next generation of ``smart phones'' and tablet-style PCs, which also rely on handwriting input, is further targeting the consumer market. However, in the majority of these devices the handwriting input method is still not satisfying. In current pdas people still use input methods, which abstract from the natural writing style, e.g. in the widespread Graffiti. Thus there is demand for a handwriting recognition system which is accurate, efficient and which can deal with the natural handwriting of a wide range of different writers.

However, on-line handwriting data is not of a fixed dimension, but of a variable-length sequential form. In this respect SVMs cannot be applied to HWR straightforwardly. We have addressed this issue by developing an appropriate SVM kernel for sequential data, the Gaussian dynamic time warping (GDTW) kernel. The basic idea of the GDTW kernel is, that instead of the squared Euclidean distance in the usual Gaussian kernel it uses the dynamic time warping distance. In addition to on-line handwriting recognition the GDTW kernel can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g. speech recognition or genome processing. Experiments have shown superior recognition rate in comparison to an HMM-based classifier for relative small training sets (~ 6000) and comparable rates for larger training sets.

The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accura...
