Soft computing is a collection of methodologies, which aim to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. The focus is to publish the highest quality research in application and convergence of the areas of Fuzzy Logic , Neural Networks , Evolutionary Computing , Rough Sets and other similar techniques to address real world complexities. Applied Soft Computing is a rolling publication: articles are published as soon as the editor-in-chief has accepted them. Therefore, the web site will continuously be updated with new articles and the publication time will be short. Major Topics: The scope of this journal covers the following soft computing and related techniques, interactions between several soft computing techniques, and their industrial applications: Fuzzy Computing Neuro Computing Evolutionary Computing Probabilistic Computing Immunological Computing Hybrid Methods Rough Sets Chaos Theory Particle Swarm Ant Colony Wavelet Morphic Computing The application areas of interest include but are not limited to: Decision Support Process and System Control System Identification and Modelling Engineerin Design Optimisation Signal or Image Processing Vision or Pattern Recognition Condition Monitoring Fault Diagnosis Systems Integration Internet Tools Human-Machine Interface Time Series Prediction Robotics Motion Control and Power Electronics Biomedical Engineering Virtual Reality Reactive Distributed AI Telecommunications Consumer Electronics Industrial Electronics Manufacturing Systems Power and Energy Data Mining Data Visualisation Intelligent Information Retrieval Bio-inspired Systems Autonomous Reasoning Intelligent Agents Multi-objective Optimisation Process Optimisation Agricultural Machinery and Produce Nano and Micro-systems View full aims and scope Editor-in-Chief: R.

The theory of fuzzy sets now encompasses a well organized corpus of basic notions including (and not restricted to) aggregation operations, a generalized theory of relations, specific measures of information content, a calculus of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy sets are also the cornerstone of a non-additive uncertainty theory, namely possibility theory, and of a versatile tool for both linguistic and numerical modeling: fuzzy rule-based systems. Numerous works now combine fuzzy concepts with other scientific disciplines as well as modern technologies. In mathematics fuzzy sets have triggered new research topics in connection with category theory, topology, algebra, analysis. Fuzzy sets are also part of a recent trend in the study of generalized measures and integrals, and are combined with statistical methods. Furthermore, fuzzy sets have strong logical underpinnings in the tradition of many-valued logics. Fuzzy set-based techniques are also an important ingredient in the development of information technologies . In the field of information processing fuzzy sets are important in clustering, data analysis and data fusion, pattern recognition and computer vision. Fuzzy rule-based modeling has been combined with other techniques such as neural nets and evolutionary computing and applied to systems and control engineering, with applications to robotics, complex process control and supervision. In thefield of information systems, fuzzy sets play a role in the development of intelligent and flexible manBmachine interfaces and the storage of imprecise linguistic information. In Artificial Intelligence various forms of knowledge representation and automated reasoning frameworks benefit from fuzzy set-based techniques, for instance in interpolative reasoning, non-monotonic reasoning, diagnosis, logic programming, constraint-directed reasoning, etc. Fuzzy expert systems have been devised for fault diagnosis,and also in medical science. In decision and organization sciences, fuzzy sets has had a great impact in preference modeling and multicriteria evaluation, and has helped bringing optimization techniques closer to the users needs. Applications can be found in many areas such as management, production research, and finance. Moreover concepts and methods of fuzzy set theory have attracted scientists in many other disciplines pertaining to human-oriented studies such as cognitive psychology and some aspects of social sciences. The scope of the journal Fuzzy Sets and Systems has expanded so as to account for all facets of the field while emphasizing its specificity as bridging the gap between the flexibility of human representations and the precision and clarity of mathematical or computerized representations, be they numerical or symbolic. The journal welcomes original and significant contributions in the area of Fuzzy Sets whether on empirical or mathematical foundations, or their applications to any domain of information technology, and more generally to any field of investigation where fuzzy sets are relevant. Applied papers demonstrating the usefulness of fuzzy methodology in practical problems are particularly welcome. Fuzzy Sets and Systems publishes high-quality research articles, surveys as well as case studies. Separate sections are Recent Literature, and the Bulletin, which offers research reports, book reviews and conference announcements and various news items. Invited review articles on topics of general interest are included and special issues are published regularly. View full aims and scope Co-Editors-in-Chief: B. De Baets , D. Dubois , E.

The journal aims to connect the ideas and techniques of soft computing with other disciplines.   Soft Computing is dedicated to system solutions based on soft computing paradigms. It provides rapid dissemination of important results in soft computing, a fusion of research in evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, neural science, neural net systems, fuzzy set theory, fuzzy systems, Bayesian networks, chaos theory, chaotic systems.   By linking the ideas and techniques of soft computing with other disciplines, the journal serves as a unifying platform that fosters comparisons, extensions, and new applications. As a result, the journal is an international forum for all scientists engaged in research and development in this fast growing field. Soft Computing - Section Foundations   The Section Foundations welcomes original and significant contributions to the mathematical and logical foundations of soft computing, and related areas. The Section is a forum that aims at promoting, circulating, and stimulating the research on mathematical foundations of soft computing intended in a broad sense as a method for dealing with non crisp information, for instance characterized by the presence of vagueness, imprecisions, high complexity, or uncertainty. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to,   Algebra and algebraic logic, Computational paradigms and computational complexity Description logic, temporal logic, dynamic logic, and modal logic Domain theory and type theory Fuzzy logic, fuzzy set theory, and many-valued logic Substructural logic Probability logic, belief functions, etc.   Soft Computing – Section Methodologies and Applications   The Section MA aims at promoting and stimulating the research in the field of the development of enhanced computational systems based on innovative or consolidated soft computing methodologies such as Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms. Under this perspective, particular attention is given to hybrid and agent-based systems i.e., computational frameworks that use different soft computing approaches in a synergic way in order to face the intrinsic complexities characterizing real environments and exploit imprecise and vague information which strongly characterizes real-world scenarios. As consequence, this journal section seeks original research contributions with a focus on applications belonging but not limited to following areas:   computer networks, data mining, image and video processing, intelligence agents, machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics, web intelligence.
