Daniel Dennett -- whose work unites neuroscience, computer science, and evolutionary biology -- has some provocative answers. Is he on to something, or just chasing the zeitgeist? by Harvey Blume December 9, 1998 B ack when I was a student of philosophy, in the late sixties, it was customary to divide the discipline into two schools: "analytic" and "continental." Continental philosophers typically built up large edifices of meaning. Analytic philosophers broke large systems down, scrutinizing every brick. Continental philosophers at times overreached, acting as though thought alone were capable of storming the gates of heaven and hell. Analytic philosophers were at times intellectually stingy. If continental philosophy could sound like poetry or music, analytic philosophy seemed anxious to sound like science. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who saw every aspect of history, politics, religion, and art as a moment in the unfolding of the World Spirit, might be nominated to be the standard bearer for continental philosophy. Ludwig Wittgenstein might be picked, on behalf of analytic philosophy, to deflate Hegel's overflowing theses and antitheses. Wittgenstein, after all, is well known for writing, in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), "What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence." A Conversation Harvey Blume interviews the philosopher who never met a robot he didn't like. Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University, points not only to an array of contemporary issues but also to the continental-analytic fault line that runs through philosophy itself. When I started reading Dennett recently, I thought at first that I was dealing with an analytic philosopher who used artificial intelligence and computer science to pare philosophical problems down to manageable size. That's true as far as it goes -- it's tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn't like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments. Instead of arguing interminably about how a mind works, Dennett believes it makes sense to build one, however rudimentary, and set it loose to see what it can do. If you're staging a Turing Test, in order to see if a computer can fool humans into thinking it is truly intelligent, Dennett would be exactly the philosopher to sit on the board of judges -- as he has several times. If you're designing a state-of-the-art robot in order to see how it negotiates the real world (or some subset thereof), Dennett would be the man for your team -- and not surprisingly he does have ties to the artificial intelligence (AI) community, and is invited to go where other philosophers are not encouraged or have no wish to go. He works closely, for example, with Rod Brooks, the head of MIT's AI Lab , on the design of Cog the "cognitive robot." Cog the "cognitive robot." Alan Turing , the question of machine intelligence has become a central theme of our time -- and here, as elsewhere, Dennett brings analytic rigor to bear. To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: "The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves." Daniel Dennett , in an interview with Harvey Blume. lan vital, or, to use Dennett's term, a "sky-hook"), how can you be sure that life, cooked up over eons in the laboratory of nature, is different -- fundamentally, rather than by degree of refinement -- from the models produced in an AI lab? The Society of Mind ), Freud was ahead of his time in showing how the ego stole its precious self-awareness from the activities of innumerable processes that are anything but self-aware -- in other words, from the unconscious. Freud's unconscious becomes a placeholder for neural networking, massively distributed parallel processing, or some other trick of wiring that will one day allow Cog or one of its kin to be launched mindfully into the world. D ennett is a skillful writer who has probed mind-body-machine connections in his books Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology (1978), Consciousness Explained (1991), and Brainchildren: Essays on Designing Minds (1998). When I met with him recently in his office at Tufts, he was quick to acknowledge how difficult it is to talk about the mind these days without using metaphors drawn from computer science. In his view, this is just fine. "Taking on new concepts," he said, "new ways of thinking about things, so that you suddenly open up new model spaces to explore -- that's great, but you are also tying your hands when you do that." He continued, "Now, it's very important that you tie your hands. Working under constraint is a necessary condition for really important inventions. All the great art of the Renaissance was done under the constraint that it had to be in the service of Christian iconography. Can you make great art under those circumstances? You sure can. Would they have made greater art if they had been free bohemians instead of coddled slaves of bishops and dukes? No, I don't think so." Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995), Dennett points out that Charles Babbage (the mathematician and early computer pioneer) and Charles Darwin attended the same London parties, probably chewed the same mutton, and quite possibly discussed some of the notions that later became so hugely influential in evolutionary theory and computer science. The meeting of Darwin and Babbage brought a central idea of Darwin's Dangerous Idea alive for me -- namely, that evolution and computers are driven by similar processes that are familiar, at least in part, to any software engineer. You write small pieces of dumb code that work with other simple pieces of code in order to produce systems of greater complexity, which in turn interact with other complex systems in order to give higher degrees of functionality, and so on, until you wind up with a program that is smart -- or, at least, smart enough to do something that needs doing. Finally, you get operating systems, you get an Internet -- or, depending on your raw materials and the time allotted, you get DNA, mammals, and self-awareness. Daniel Dennett , in an interview with Harvey Blume. Darwin's Dangerous Idea argues that evolution is not a feat of pure thought or of magic or of brilliant planning but simply of engineering over time -- except that it's a case of engineering minus any particular engineer, design minus a designer. In a sense, you have a synthesis as broad as any Hegel attempted, but instead of the World Spirit you have dumb processes of evolution that all on their own suffice to bring about animation, self-replication, intelligence, and the rest. Does evolution obey the dictates of some presiding genius? Does it require a bit of divine guidance? No. Is it nevertheless sensible to think of it as possessing an intelligence that can be usefully compared to that of thermostats and minds? Yes. Next page ...

In the context of the Imitation Game, providing an image purporting to be of the participant would be easy even for an unsophisticated computer program to provide, and could influence the judge towards perceiving the mechanical subject as human. Rheingold 1993 ]. The claim is that these visual categorization cues distort the our view of the other, whereas the unadorned letters of the textual environment allow one's ideas to be conveyed without prejudice. The underlying argument is that the knowledge of the other that we seek is knowledge of inner state, which is best understood from one's words as direct output of the mind, as opposed to physical features, which are incidental though highly influential in shaping other's opinions of one. Ekman 1992 ] 4 . If the traits in question do not have a visible component or if the visual component is an imperfect cue, deception may be easier in a more visual environment, for the visual display holds out the apparent (though potentially false) promise of immediately perceivable authenticity and thus participants may be less guarded in this familiar and seemingly transparent medium. Herring 1994 Tannen 1996 ]. While the large number of poorly disguised men masquerading as women online shows that this knowledge is neither obvious nor commonplace, performing a convincing impersonation in a text environment is not beyond the abilities of an astute observer of social dynamics. In a live video environment, subsequent interactions require a far more extensive understanding of gendered discourse, expression, gesture etc. While this is not impossible, as evidenced by the existence of highly convincing drag queens, it requires considerable skill, observation and a degree of natural aptitude.

AND THEN THERE WAS 1. A MIND-BENDING MEDITATION ON THE TRANSCENDENT POWER OF DIGITAL COMPUTATION. By Kevin Kelly At today's rates of compression, you could download the entire 3 billion digits of your DNA onto about four CDs. That 3-gigabyte genome sequence represents the prime coding information of a human body your life as numbers. Biology, that pulsating mass of plant and animal flesh, is conceived by science today as an information process. As computers keep shrinking, we can imagine our complex bodies being numerically condensed to the size of two tiny cells. These micro-memory devices are called the egg and sperm. They are packed with information. Alex Ostroy That life might be information, as biologists propose, is far more intuitive than the corresponding idea that hard matter is information as well. When we bang a knee against a table leg, it sure doesn't feel like we knocked into information. But that's the idea many physicists are formulating. The spooky nature of material things is not new. Once science examined matter below the level of fleeting quarks and muons, it knew the world was incorporeal. What could be less substantial than a realm built out of waves of quantum probabilities? And what could be weirder? Digital physics is both. It suggests that those strange and insubstantial quantum wavicles, along with everything else in the universe, are themselves made of nothing but 1s and 0s. The physical world itself is digital. The scientist John Archibald Wheeler (coiner of the term "black hole") was onto this in the '80s. He claimed that, fundamentally, atoms are made up of of bits of information. As he put it in a 1989 lecture, "Its are from bits." He elaborated: "Every it every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely from binary choices, bits . What we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes/no questions." To get a sense of the challenge of describing physics as a software program, picture three atoms: two hydrogen and one oxygen. Put on the magic glasses of digital physics and watch as the three atoms bind together to form a water molecule. As they merge, each seems to be calculating the optimal angle and distance at which to attach itself to the others. The oxygen atom uses yes/no decisions to evaluate all possible courses toward the hydrogen atom, then usually selects the optimal 104.45 degrees by moving toward the other hydrogen at that very angle. Every chemical bond is thus calculated. If this sounds like a simulation of physics, then you understand perfectly, because in a world made up of bits, physics is exactly the same as a simulation of physics. There's no difference in kind, just in degree of exactness. In the movie The Matrix , simulations are so good you can't tell if you're in one. In a universe run on bits, everything is a simulation. An ultimate simulation needs an ultimate computer, and the new science of digitalism says that the universe itself is the ultimate computer actually the only computer. Further, it says, all the computation of the human world, especially our puny little PCs, merely piggybacks on cycles of the great computer. Weaving together the esoteric teachings of quantum physics with the latest theories in computer science, pioneering digital thinkers are outlining a way of understanding all of physics as a form of computation. From this perspective, computation seems almost a theological process. It takes as its fodder the primeval choice between yes or no, the fundamental state of 1 or 0. After stripping away all externalities, all material embellishments, what remains is the purest state of existence: here/not here. Am/not am. In the Old Testament, when Moses asks the Creator, "Who are you?" the being says, in effect, "Am." One bit. One almighty bit. Yes. One. Exist. It is the simplest statement possible. All creation, from this perch, is made from this irreducible foundation. Every mountain, every star, the smallest salamander or woodland tick, each thought in our mind, each flight of a ball is but a web of elemental yes/nos woven together. If the theory of digital physics holds up, movement ( f = ma ), energy ( E = mc ), gravity, dark matter, and antimatter can all be explained by elaborate programs of 1/0 decisions. Bits can be seen as a digital version of the "atoms" of classical Greece: the tiniest constituent of existence. But these new digital atoms are the basis not only of matter, as the Greeks thought, but of energy, motion, mind, and life. From this perspective, computation, which juggles and manipulates these primal bits, is a silent reckoning that uses a small amount of energy to rearrange symbols. And its result is a signal that makes a difference a difference that can be felt as a bruised knee. The input of computation is energy and information; the output is order, structure, extropy. Our awakening to the true power of computation rests on two suspicions. The first is that computation can describe all things . To date, computer scientists have been able to encapsulate every logical argument, scientific equation, and literary work that we know about into the basic notation of computation. Now, with the advent of digital signal processing, we can capture video, music, and art in the same form. Even emotion is not immune. Researchers Cynthia Breazeal at MIT and Charles Guerin and Albert Mehrabian in Quebec have built Kismet and EMIR (Emotional Model for Intelligent Response), two systems that exhibit primitive feelings. The second supposition is that all things can compute . We have begun to see that almost any kind of material can serve as a computer. Human brains, which are mostly water, compute fairly well. (The first "calculators" were clerical workers figuring mathematical tables by hand.) So can sticks and strings. In 1975, as an undergraduate student, engineer Danny Hillis constructed a digital computer out of skinny Tinkertoys. In 2000, Hillis designed a digital computer made of only steel and tungsten that is indirectly powered by human muscle. This slow-moving device turns a clock intended to tick for 10,000 years. He hasn't made a computer with pipes and pumps, but, he says, he could. Recently, scientists have used both quantum particles and minute strands of DNA to perform computations.

 Copyright JASSS Ulrich Frank and Klaus G. Troitzsch * Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation here Abstract Keywords: 1.1 1.2 Two years ago, the simsoc mailing list experienced a longish discussion [1] 1.3 1.4 In an inspiring and partially provocative article, Scott Moss and Bruce Edmonds argue that simulation provides the social sciences with a powerful instrument to generate empirical evidence thereby contributing to better social sciences. Jrg Becker, Bjrn Niehaves and Karsten Klose develop a framework for epistemological perspectives on simulation, which can be used to analyse and to systematise the implicit epistemological assumptions underlying most simulations. Their main concern is that these are often not made explicit and the framework they offer should help to explicate hidden assumptions. Alex Schmid tries to answer the question "What is the truth of simulation?"For this purpose, he considers well known theories of truth to analyse how they could contribute to a concept of truth or appropriateness applicable to simulations. Nuno David, Jaime Sichman and Helder Coelho analyse the methodological status of computer-based simulation in the social sciences. For this purpose, they introduce the term 'intentional computing', which accounts for the specific epistemological characteristics of agent-based simulation. Gnter Kppers and Johannes Lenhard distinguish between the natural sciences and the social sciences mainly under the aspect that the former enjoy having well-accepted mathematical models while the latter have not. They argue that in the former case validation is no problem once it can be shown that a computer simulation model performs exactly the numerical calculations postulated by the mathematical model. As the social sciences have not yet developed generally accepted mathematical models, validation in this case means trying to find that "some of the characteristics of the social dynamics known from experience with the social world are reproduced by the simulation". Matthias Meyer, Bernd O. Heine and Oliver Strangfeld analyse the special validation problems which arise from the fact that in most cases the system modelled in a simulation is only a stylised fact instead of a part of the real world. Thus in a way they tackle the same aspect as Gnter Kppers and Johannes Lenhard as what they call "characteristics of the social dynamics known from experience with the social world" are often enough nothing but stylised facts. Riccardo Boero and Flaminio Squazzoni suggest validating simulation through empirical research. They discuss and classify various validation strategies, and they argue for case-based models which lend themselves to falsification.. Petra Ahrweiler and Nigel Gilbert present a framework for evaluating the quality of simulations. For this purpose, they differentiate various views on a simulation. To illustrate their approach, they introduce the case study of a 'simulated' coffee shop. 1.5 Notes * This article has been translated into Belorussian . 1 The discussion can be found in the November 2003 section of http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/archives/simsoc.html , topics "simulation and explanation" and "theory and simulation".

In Anderson Michael, Anderson Susan Armen Chris (eds.), AAAI Fall Symposium . ( Google ) Abstract: As autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) begin living in the home, performing service tasks and assisting with daily activities, their actions will have profound ethical implications. Consequently, AMRs need to be outfitted with the ability to act morally with regard to human life and safety. Yet, in the area of robotics where morality is a relevant field of endeavor (i.e. human-robot interaction) the sub-discipline of morality does not exist. In response, the Utilibot project seeks to provide a point of initiation for the implementation of ethics in an AMR. The Utilibot is a decision-theoretic AMR guided by the utilitarian notion of the maximization of human well-being. The core ethical decision-making capacity of the Utilibot consists of two dynamic Bayesian networks that model human and environmental health, a dynamic decision network that accounts for decisions and utilities, and a Markov decision process (MDP) that decomposes the planning problem to solve for the optimal course of action to maximize human safety and well-being.

( Google ) Abstract: he question of the possibility of artificial consciousness is both very new and very old. It is new in the context of contemporary cognitive science and its concern with whether a machine can be conscious; it is old in the form of the mind/body problem and the other minds problem of philosophy. Contemporary enthusiasts proceed at their peril if they ignore or are ignorant of the false starts and blind alleys that the older thinkers have painfully worked through Morreau, Michael Kraus, Sarit (1998). Syntactical Treatments of Propositional Attitudes. Artificial Intelligence 106 (1):161-177. ( Google ) Abstract: Syntactical treatments of propositional attitudes are attractive to artificial intelligence researchers. But results of Montague (1974) and Thomason (1980) seem to show that syntactical treatments are not viable. They show that if representation languages are sufficiently expressive, then axiom schemes characterizing knowledge and belief give rise to paradox. Des RiviÃ¨res and Levesque (1988) characterize a class of sentences within which these schemes can safely be instantiated. These sentences do not quantify over the propositional objects of knowledge and belief. We argue that their solution is incomplete, and extend it by characterizing a more inclusive class of sentences over which the axiom schemes can safely range. Our sentences do quantify over propositional objects. PÃ¡ez, AndrÃ©s (2009). Artificial explanations: The epistemological interpretation of explanation in ai. Synthese 170 (1). ( Google ) Abstract: In this paper I critically examine the notion of explanation used in artificial intelligence in general, and in the theory of belief revision in particular. I focus on two of the best known accounts in the literature: Pagnuccoâs abductive expansion functions and GÃ¤rdenforsâ counterfactual analysis. I argue that both accounts are at odds with the way in which this notion has historically been understood in philosophy. They are also at odds with the explanatory strategies used in actual scientific practice. At the end of the paper I outline a set of desiderata for an epistemologically motivated, scientifically informed belief revision model for explanation 6.1 Can Machines Think? 6.1a The Turing Test Akman, Varol Blackburn, Patrick (2000).

Behaviorism and psychologism: Why Block's argument against behaviorism is unsound. Philosophical Psychology 18 (2):179-186. ( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Ned Block ((1981). Psychologism and behaviorism. Philosophical Review, 90, 5-43.) argued that a behaviorist conception of intelligence is mistaken, and that the nature of an agent's internal processes is relevant for determining whether the agent has intelligence. He did that by describing a machine which lacks intelligence, yet can answer questions put to it as an intelligent person would. The nature of his machine's internal processes, he concluded, is relevant for determining that it lacks intelligence. I argue against Block that it is not the nature of its processes but of its linguistic behavior which is responsible for his machine's lack of intelligence. As I show, not only has Block failed to establish that the nature of internal processes is conceptually relevant for psychology, in fact his machine example actually supports some version of behaviorism. As Wittgenstein has maintained, as far as psychology is concerned, there may be chaos inside Additional links for this entry: http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/MX24138627651300.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/713997477.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2005/00000018/00000002/art00002 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a713997477~fulltext=713240930 Block, Ned (1981).

The TT errs in testing behavior and not mechanisms. A nice, thorough paper. Abstract: Let psychologism be the doctrine that whether behavior is intelligent behavior depends on the character of the internal information processing that produces it. More specifically, I mean psychologism to involve the doctrine that two systems could have actual and potential behavior _typical_ of familiar intelligent beings, that the two systems could be exactly alike in their actual and potential behavior, and in their behavioral dispositions and capacities and counterfactual behavioral properties (i.e., what behaviors, behavioral dispositions, and behavioral capacities they would have exhibited had their stimuli differed)--the two systems could be alike in all these ways, yet there could be a difference in the information processing that mediates their stimuli and responses that determines that one is not at all intelligent while the other is fully intelligent Additional links for this entry: http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/Phil951/Block.pdf http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.pdf http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.htm http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2184371.pdf Bringsjord, Selmer (2000).

Animals, zombanimals, and the total Turing test. Journal of Logic, Language and Information 9 (4). ( Google ) Abstract: Alan Turing devised his famous test (TT) through a slight modificationof the parlor game in which a judge tries to ascertain the gender of twopeople who are only linguistically accessible. Stevan Harnad hasintroduced the Total TT, in which the judge can look at thecontestants in an attempt to determine which is a robot and which aperson. But what if we confront the judge with an animal, and arobot striving to pass for one, and then challenge him to peg which iswhich? Now we can index TTT to a particular animal and its syntheticcorrelate. We might therefore have TTTrat, TTTcat,TTTdog, and so on. These tests, as we explain herein, are abetter barometer of artificial intelligence (AI) than Turing's originalTT, because AI seems to have ammunition sufficient only to reach thelevel of artificial animal, not artificial person Bringsjord, Selmer ; Bello, P. Ferrucci, David A. (2001). Creativity, the Turing test, and the (better) Lovelace test. Minds and Machines 11 (1):3-27. ( Cited by 11 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The Turing Test (TT) is claimed by many to be a way to test for the presence, in computers, of such ``deep'' phenomena as thought and consciousness. Unfortunately, attempts to build computational systems able to pass TT (or at least restricted versions of this test) have devolved into shallow symbol manipulation designed to, by hook or by crook, trick. The human creators of such systems know all too well that they have merely tried to fool those people who interact with their systems into believing that these systems really have minds. And the problem is fundamental: the structure of the TT is such as to cultivate tricksters. A better test is one that insists on a certain restrictive epistemic relation between an artificial agent (or system) A, its output o, and the human architect H of A â a relation which, roughly speaking, obtains when H cannot account for how A produced o. We call this test the ``Lovelace Test'' in honor of Lady Lovelace, who believed that only when computers originate things should they be believed to have minds Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596904 http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bringsjord00creativity.html http://www.rpi.edu/~faheyj2/SB/SELPAP/DARTMOUTH/lt3.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/nrvl130w46xj6g22/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/nrvl130w46xj6g22/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=319539=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/NRVL130W46XJ6G22.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2001/00000011/00000001/00319539 Clark, Thomas W. (1992). The Turing test as a novel form of hermeneutics. International Studies in Philosophy 24 (1):17-31. ( Cited by 6 | Google ) Clifton, Andrew (ms). Blind man's bluff and the Turing test. ( Google ) Abstract: It seems plausible that under the conditions of the Turing test, congenitally blind people could nevertheless, with sufficient preparation, successfully represent themselves to remotely located interrogators as sighted. Having never experienced normal visual sensations, the successful blind player can prevail in this test only by playing a âlying gameââimitating the phenomenological claims of sighted people, in the absence of the qualitative visual experiences to which such statements purportedly refer. This suggests that a computer or robot might pass the Turing test in the same way, in the absence not only of visual experience, but qualitative consciousness in general. Hence, the standard Turing test does not provide a valid criterion for the presence of consciousness. A âsensorimetricâ version of the Turing test fares no better, for the apparent correlations we observe between cognitive functions and qualitative conscious experiences seems to be contingent, not necessary. We must therefore define consciousness not in terms of its causes and effects, but rather, in terms of the distinctive properties of its content, such as its possession of qualitative character and apparent intrinsic valueâthe property which confers upon consciousness its moral significance. As a means of determining whether or nor a machine is conscious, in this sense, an alternative to the standard Turing test is proposed Copeland, B. Jack (2000). The Turing test.

And how many human beings (including Turing) could pass? ( Google ) Abstract: The so-called Turing test, as it is usually interpreted, sets a benchmark standard for determining when we might call a machine intelligent. We can call a machine intelligent if the following is satisfied: if a group of wise observers were conversing with a machine through an exchange of typed messages, those observers could not tell whether they were talking to a human being or to a machine. To pass the test, the machine has to be intelligent but it also should be responsive in a manner which cannot be distinguished from a human being. This standard interpretation presents the Turing test as a criterion for demarcating intelligent from non-intelligent entities.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Searleâs discussions over the years 1980-2004 of the implications of his âChinese Roomâ Gedanken experiment are frustrating because they proceed from a correct assertion: (1) âInstantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality;â and an incorrect assertion: (2) âThe explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program.â In this article, I describe how to construct a Gedanken zombie Chinese Room program that will pass the Turing test and at the same time unambiguously demonstrates the correctness of (1). I then describe how to construct a Gedanken Chinese brain program that will pass the Turing test, has a mind, and understands Chinese, thus demonstrating that (2) is incorrect. Searleâs instantiation of this program can and does produce intentionality. Searleâs longstanding ignorance of Chinese is simply irrelevant and always has been.

The Cartesian test combines two distinct elements that Keith Gunderson has labeled the language test and the action test. Though traditional interpretation holds that the action test attempts to determine whether an agent is acting upon principles, I argue that the action test is best understood as a test of common sense.

(Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: No computer that had not experienced the world as we humans had could pass a rigorously administered standard Turing Test. We show that the use of âsubcognitiveâ questions allows the standard Turing Test to indirectly probe the human subcognitive associative concept network built up over a lifetime of experience with the world. Not only can this probing reveal differences in cognitive abilities, but crucially, even differences in _physical aspects_ of the candidates can be detected. Consequently, it is unnecessary to propose even harder versions of the Test in which all physical and behavioral aspects of the two candidates had to be indistinguishable before allowing the machine to pass the Test. Any machine that passed the âsimplerâ symbols- in/symbols-out test as originally proposed by Turing would be intelligent. The problem is that, even in its original form, the Turing Test is already too hard and too anthropocentric for any machine that was not a physical, social, and behavioral carbon copy of ourselves to actually pass it. Consequently, the Turing Test, even in its standard version, is not a reasonable test for general machine intelligence. There is no need for an even stronger version of the Test Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/french00peeking.html http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/LEAD/people/french/peeking.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/24PHYLU4NX08NHQF.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/teta/2000/00000012/00000003/art00006 French, Robert M.

The Turing test: The first fifty years. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 4 (3):115-121. ( Cited by 15 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The Turing Test, originally proposed as a simple operational definition of intelligence, has now been with us for exactly half a century. It is safe to say that no other single article in computer science, and few other articles in science in general, have generated so much discussion. The present article chronicles the comments and controversy surrounding Turing's classic article from its publication to the present. The changing perception of the Turing Test over the last fifty years has paralleled the changing attitudes in the scientific community towards artificial intelligence: from the unbridled optimism of 1960's to the current realization of the immense difficulties that still lie ahead. I conclude with the prediction that the Turing Test will remain important, not only as a landmark in the history of the development of intelligent machines, but also with real relevance to future generations of people living in a world in which the cognitive capacities of machines will be vastly greater than they are now Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/french00turing.html http://srsc.ulb.ac.be/cogsci/papers/TICS-French_turing.pdf http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/LEAD/people/french/TICS_turing.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve=Citation http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/13646613/2000/00000004/00000003/art01453 Gunderson, Keith (1964).

Does mind piggyback on robotic and symbolic capacity? In H. Morowitz J. Singer (eds.), The Mind, the Brain, and Complex Adaptive Systems . Addison Wesley. ( Google ) Abstract: Cognitive science is a form of "reverse engineering" (as Dennett has dubbed it). We are trying to explain the mind by building (or explaining the functional principles of) systems that have minds. A "Turing" hierarchy of empirical constraints can be applied to this task, from t1, toy models that capture only an arbitrary fragment of our performance capacity, to T2, the standard "pen-pal" Turing Test (total symbolic capacity), to T3, the Total Turing Test (total symbolic plus robotic capacity), to T4 (T3 plus internal [neuromolecular] indistinguishability). All scientific theories are underdetermined by data. What is the right level of empirical constraint for cognitive theory? I will argue that T2 is underconstrained (because of the Symbol Grounding Problem and Searle's Chinese Room Argument) and that T4 is overconstrained (because we don't know what neural data, if any, are relevant). T3 is the level at which we solve the "other minds" problem in everyday life, the one at which evolution operates (the Blind Watchmaker is no mind-reader either) and the one at which symbol systems can be grounded in the robotic capacity to name and manipulate the objects their symbols are about. I will illustrate this with a toy model for an important component of T3 -- categorization -- using neural nets that learn category invariance by "warping" similarity space the way it is warped in human categorical perception: within-category similarities are amplified and between-category similarities are attenuated. This analog "shape" constraint is the grounding inherited by the arbitrarily shaped symbol that names the category and by all the symbol combinations it enters into. No matter how tightly one constrains any such model, however, it will always be more underdetermined than normal scientific and engineering theory. This will remain the ineliminable legacy of the mind/body problem Harnad, Stevan (1994). Levels of functional equivalence in reverse bioengineering: The Darwinian Turing test for artificial life. Artificial Life 1 (3):93-301. ( Cited by 35 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Both Artificial Life and Artificial Mind are branches of what Dennett has called "reverse engineering": Ordinary engineering attempts to build systems to meet certain functional specifications, reverse bioengineering attempts to understand how systems that have already been built by the Blind Watchmaker work. Computational modelling (virtual life) can capture the formal principles of life, perhaps predict and explain it completely, but it can no more be alive than a virtual forest fire can be hot. In itself, a computational model is just an ungrounded symbol system; no matter how closely it matches the properties of what is being modelled, it matches them only formally, with the mediation of an interpretation. Synthetic life is not open to this objection, but it is still an open question how close a functional equivalence is needed in order to capture life. Close enough to fool the Blind Watchmaker is probably close enough, but would that require molecular indistinguishability, and if so, do we really need to go that far?

Other bodies, other minds: A machine incarnation of an old philosophical problem. [Journal (Paginated)] 1 (1):43-54. ( Cited by 99 | Annotation | Google | More links ) On the Total Turing Test (full behavioral equivalence) as a test for mind. Abstract: Explaining the mind by building machines with minds runs into the other-minds problem: How can we tell whether any body other than our own has a mind when the only way to know is by being the other body? In practice we all use some form of Turing Test: If it can do everything a body with a mind can do such that we can't tell them apart, we have no basis for doubting it has a mind. But what is "everything" a body with a mind can do? Turing's original "pen-pal" version (the TT) only tested linguistic capacity, but Searle has shown that a mindless symbol-manipulator could pass the TT undetected. The Total Turing Test (TTT) calls for all of our linguistic and robotic capacities; immune to Searle's argument, it suggests how to ground a symbol manipulating system in the capacity to pick out the objects its symbols refer to. No Turing Test, however, can guarantee that a body has a mind. Worse, nothing in the explanation of its successful performance requires a model to have a mind at all. Minds are hence very different from the unobservables of physics (e.g., superstrings); and Turing Testing, though essential for machine-modeling the mind, can really only yield an explanation of the body Additional links for this entry: http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003379/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001578/ http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103493.103530 http://cogprints.org/1578/0/harnad91.otherminds.html http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/78/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003379/01/harnad91.otherminds.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001578/00/harnad91.otherminds.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:3379 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1578 http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5733025r3t44248/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/T5733025R3T44248.pdf http://cogprints.org/1578/1/harnad91.otherminds.html Harnad, Stevan (2006).

It especially belies fears that the test is too easy. At the same time, this failure disconfirms expectations that human level artificial intelligence will be forthcoming any time soon. On the other hand, the success of Turing's second prediction (that acknowledgment of computer thought processes would become commonplace) in practice amply confirms the thought that computers think in some manner and are possessed of some level of intelligence already. This lends ever-growing support to the hypothesis that computers will think at a human level eventually, despite the abject failure of Turing's first prediction Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/p14045502315u372/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=319542=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/P14045502315U372.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2001/00000011/00000001/00319542 Hauser, Larry (1993).

I disagree with hisacceptance of it!

Moreover, it correlates with classicalpsychometric tests, thus establishing the first firm connection betweeninformation theoretical notions and traditional IQ tests. The TuringTest is compared with the C-test and the combination of the two isquestioned. In consequence, the idea of using the Turing Test as apractical test of intelligence should be surpassed, and substituted bycomputational and factorial tests of different cognitive abilities, amuch more useful approach for artificial intelligence progress and formany other intriguing questions that present themselves beyond theTuring Test Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=595843.595997 http://www.dsic.upv.es/~jorallo/escrits/TT-JHdez.ps.gz http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/hernandez-orallo99beyond.html http://www.springerlink.com/content/h271n6173ll3773x/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=269489=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/H271N6173LL3773X.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/jlli/2000/00000009/00000004/00269489 Hofstadter, Douglas R.

Turing and the fragility and insubstantiality of evolutionary explanations: A puzzle about the unity of Alan Turing's work with some larger implications. Philosophical Psychology 14 (1):83-94. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: As is well known, Alan Turing drew a line, embodied in the "Turing test," between intellectual and physical abilities, and hence between cognitive and natural sciences. Less familiarly, he proposed that one way to produce a "passer" would be to educate a "child machine," equating the experimenter's improvements in the initial structure of the child machine with genetic mutations, while supposing that the experimenter might achieve improvements more expeditiously than natural selection. On the other hand, in his foundational "On the chemical basis of morphogenesis," Turing insisted that biological explanation clearly confine itself to purely physical and chemical means, eschewing vitalist and teleological talk entirely and hewing to D'Arcy Thompson's line that "evolutionary 'explanations,'" are historical and narrative in character, employing the same intentional and teleological vocabulary we use in doing human history, and hence, while perhaps on occasion of heuristic value, are not part of biology as a natural science. To apply Turing's program to recent issues, the attempt to give foundations to the social and cognitive sciences in the "real science" of evolutionary biology (as opposed to Turing's biology) is neither to give foundations, nor to achieve the unification of the social/cognitive sciences and the natural sciences Additional links for this entry: http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~content=a713690490~fulltext=713240930 Leiber, Justin (2006).

The Turing test is then justified as an inductive test not as an operational definition as commonly suggested. Turing's famous prediction about his test being passed at the 70% level is disconfirmed by the results of the Loebner 2000 contest and the absence of any serious Turing test competitors from AI on the horizon. But, reports of the death of the Turing test and AI are premature. AI continues to flourish and the test continues to play an important philosophical role in AI. Intelligence attribution, methodological, and visionary arguments are given in defense of a continuing role for the Turing test.

(1994). Folk psychology. Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science . ( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: For the last 25 years discussions and debates about commonsense psychology (or âfolk psychology,â as it is often called) have been center stage in the philosophy of mind. There have been heated disagreements both about what folk psychology is and about how it is related to the scientific understanding of the mind/brain that is emerging in psychology and the neurosciences. In this chapter we will begin by explaining why folk psychology plays such an important role in the philosophy of mind. Doing that will require a quick look at a bit of the history of philosophical discussions about the mind. Weâll then turn our attention to the lively contemporary discussions aimed at clarifying the philosophical role that folk psychology is expected to play and at using findings in the cognitive sciences to get a clearer understanding of the exact nature of folk psychology Additional links for this entry: http://www.blutner.de/philom/Texte/folkpsych5.pdf http://www.blutner.de/NeuralNets/Texts/folkpsych5.pdf http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0998dgh/philos/Texte/folkpsych5.pdf http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~h0998dgh/philos/Texte/folkpsych5.pdf http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/FolkPsychologyECS.pdf http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0998dgh/NeuralNets/Texts/folkpsych5.pdf http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/FolkPsychology.pdf http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/FolkPsychology.pdf http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/phil/teach/mmm/readings/Stich - Cognitive Science and the Appeal to Tacit Theory.rtf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve=Citation Oppy, Graham Dowe, D.

( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In the 1950s, Alan Turing proposed his influential test for machine intelligence, which involved a teletyped dialogue between a human player, a machine, and an interrogator. Two readings of Turing''s rules for the test have been given. According to the standard reading of Turing''s words, the goal of the interrogator was to discover which was the human being and which was the machine, while the goal of the machine was to be indistinguishable from a human being. According to the literal reading, the goal of the machine was to simulate a man imitating a woman, while the interrogator â unaware of the real purpose of the test â was attempting to determine which of the two contestants was the woman and which was the man. The present work offers a study of Turing''s rules for the test in the context of his advocated purpose and his other texts. The conclusion is that there are several independent and mutually reinforcing lines of evidence that support the standard reading, while fitting the literal reading in Turing''s work faces severe interpretative difficulties. So, the controversy over Turing''s rules should be settled in favor of the standard reading Additional links for this entry: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=sOABQfQAHOiAecLsjc4Dkdn0Kko http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=k_FvcCrJGK1pHaGSeZX1ciLb8SM http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/v1k277193084750u/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/v1k277193084750u/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=319535=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/V1K277193084750U.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2000/00000010/00000004/00319535 Purthill, R.

( Google ) Abstract: I advocate a theory of syntactic semantics as a way of understanding how computers can think (and how the Chinese-Room-Argument objection to the Turing Test can be overcome): (1) Semantics, considered as the study of relations between symbols and meanings, can be turned into syntax â a study of relations among symbols (including meanings) â and hence syntax (i.e., symbol manipulation) can suffice for the semantical enterprise (contra Searle). (2) Semantics, considered as the process of understanding one domain (by modeling it) in terms of another, can be viewed recursively: The base case of semantic understanding âunderstanding a domain in terms of itself â is syntactic understanding. (3) An internal (or narrow), first-person point of view makes an external (or wide), third-person point of view otiose for purposes of understanding cognition Rapaport, William J. (online).

That theory is widely called "folk psychology" (sometimes "commonsense" psychology). The terms in which folk psychology is couched are the familiar ones of "belief" and "desire", "hunger", "pain" and so forth.

In the Turing Test, a human, a machine, and an interrogator are the players of the game. In our model of the Turing Test, the machine and the interrogator are formalized as Turing machines, allowing us to derive several impossibility results concerning the capabilities of the interrogator. The key issue is that the validity of the Turing test is not attributed to the capability of human or machine, but rather to the capability of the interrogator. In particular, it is shown that no Turing machine can be a perfect interrogator. We also discuss meta-imitation game and imitation game with analog interfaces where both the imitator and the interrogator are mimicked by continuous dynamical systems Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=976736 http://www.bdc.brain.riken.jp/publications/internal/jour-Undecidability_in_the_Imitation_Game/uig.pdf http://www.bdc.brain.riken.go.jp/publications/internal/jour-Undecidability_in_the_Imitation_Game/uig.pdf http://www.bdc.brain.riken.go.jp/publications/internal/trep-Undecidability_in_the_imitation_game/riken-bsi-bdc-tr2001-04.ps.Z http://www.springerlink.com/content/t2771g8512m67737/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5253133=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/T2771G8512M67737.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2004/00000014/00000002/05253133 Saygin, Ayse P. ; Cicekli, Ilyas Akman, Varol (2000).

The truly total Turing test. Minds and Machines 8 (2):263-272. ( Cited by 9 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The paper examines the nature of the behavioral evidence underlying attributions of intelligence in the case of human beings, and how this might be extended to other kinds of cognitive system, in the spirit of the original Turing Test (TT). I consider Harnad's Total Turing Test (TTT), which involves successful performance of both linguistic and robotic behavior, and which is often thought to incorporate the very same range of empirical data that is available in the human case. However, I argue that the TTT is still too weak, because it only tests the capabilities of particular tokens within a preexisting context of intelligent behavior. What is needed is a test of the cognitive type, as manifested through a number of exemplary tokens, in order to confirm that the cognitive type is able to produce the context of intelligent behavior presupposed by tests such as the TT and TTT Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=371134CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/h51pp233m1h732p0/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=150465=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/H51PP233M1H732P0.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1998/00000008/00000002/00150465 Sennett, James F.

Minds and Machines 10 (4):541-559. ( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â On a literal reading of `Computing Machinery and Intelligence'', Alan Turing presented not one, but two, practical tests to replace the question `Can machines think?'' He presented them as equivalent. I show here that the first test described in that much-discussed paper is in fact not equivalent to the second one, which has since become known as `the Turing Test''. The two tests can yield different results; it is the first, neglected test that provides the more appropriate indication of intelligence. This is because the features of intelligence upon which it relies are resourcefulness and a critical attitude to one''s habitual responses; thus the test''s applicablity is not restricted to any particular species, nor does it presume any particular capacities. This is more appropriate because the question under consideration is what would count as machine intelligence. The first test realizes a possibility that philosophers have overlooked: a test that uses a human''s linguistic performance in setting an empirical test of intelligence, but does not make behavioral similarity to that performance the criterion of intelligence. Consequently, the first test is immune to many of the philosophical criticisms on the basis of which the (so-called) `Turing Test'' has been dismissed Additional links for this entry: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=kpE5iqY7Fjm67XjSS7t2e9XqGDo http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/k11t54j7821h4230/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/k11t54j7821h4230/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=319533=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/K11T54J7821H4230.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2000/00000010/00000004/00319533 Stoica, Cristi , Turing test, easy to pass; human mind, hard to understand. ( Google ) Abstract: Under general assumptions, the Turing test can be easily passed by an appropriate algorithm. I show that for any test satisfying several general conditions, we can construct an algorithm that can pass that test, hence, any operational definition is easy to fulfill. I suggest a test complementary to Turing's test, which will measure our understanding of the human mind. The Turing test is required to fix the operational specifications of the algorithm under test; under this constrain, the additional test simply consists in measuring the length of the algorithm Traiger, Saul (2000).

( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The test Turing proposed for machine intelligence is usually understood to be a test of whether a computer can fool a human into thinking that the computer is a human.

Answering subcognitive Turing test questions: A reply to French. ( Cited by 5 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Robert French has argued that a disembodied computer is incapable of passing a Turing Test that includes subcognitive questions. Subcognitive questions are designed to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that humans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In this paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer subcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to FrenchÂs claim. My approach to answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted from a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible to answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing queries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This simple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but the scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a disembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions Additional links for this entry: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002cs.......12015T http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/turney01answering.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001798/ http://www.extractor.com/download/documents/subcognitive.pdf http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001798/00/subcognitive.pdf https://iit-iti.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/iit-publications-iti/docs/NRC-44898.pdf http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1798 http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/TW3Q03K8NK7UVQJG.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/TW3Q03K8NK7UVQJG.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/teta/2001/00000013/00000004/art00006 http://cogprints.org/1798/1/subcognitive.ps http://cogprints.org/1798/0/subcognitive.pdf Turing, Alan M.

( Cited by 9 | Annotation | Google | More links ) Proposes the Imitation game (Turing test) as a test for intelligence: If a machine can't be told apart from a human in a conversation over a teletype, then that's good enough. With responses to various objections. Abstract: I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B. We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"

( Cited by 19 | Google | More links ) Abstract: This target article argues that the Turing test implicitly rests on a "naive psychology," a naturally evolved psychological faculty which is used to predict and understand the behaviour of others in complex societies. This natural faculty is an important and implicit bias in the observer's tendency to ascribe mentality to the system in the test. The paper analyses the effects of this naive psychology on the Turing test, both from the side of the system and the side of the observer, and then proposes and justifies an inverted version of the test which allows the processes of ascription to be analysed more directly than in the standard version Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/watt96naive.html http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000506/ http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/perl/local/psyc/makedoc?id=506=html http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000506/02/psyc.96.7.14.turing-test.1.watt http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000506/01/psyc.96.7.14.turing-test.1.watt.xml Waterman, C.

Minds and Machines 11 (1):53-76. ( Cited by 8 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â This paper argues that the Turing test is based on a fixed and de-contextualized view of communicative competence. According to this view, a machine that passes the test will be able to communicate effectively in a variety of other situations. But the de-contextualized view ignores the relationship between language and social context, or, to put it another way, the extent to which speakers respond dynamically to variations in discourse function, formality level, social distance/solidarity among participants, and participants' relative degrees of power and status (Holmes, 1992). In the case of the Loebner Contest, a present day version of the Turing test, the social context of interaction can be interpreted in conflicting ways. For example, Loebner discourse is defined 1) as a friendly, casual conversation between two strangers of equal power, and 2) as a one-way transaction in which judges control the conversational floor in an attempt to expose contestants that are not human. This conflict in discourse function is irrelevant so long as the goal of the contest is to ensure that only thinking, human entities pass the test. But if the function of Loebner discourse is to encourage the production of software that can pass for human on the level of conversational ability, then the contest designers need to resolve this ambiguity in discourse function, and thus also come to terms with the kind of competence they are trying to measure Additional links for this entry: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=a-VgtvUjcFyxiSpkIASbwHF4Imk http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=IxxOEy4OGv0MfwNy7oTRa0j0_9g http://www.springerlink.com/content/p1572g5485036674/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=319544=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/P1572G5485036674.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2001/00000011/00000001/00319544 6.1b Godelian arguments Benacerraf, Paul (1967).

(1989). Murmurs in the cathedral: Review of R. Penrose, The Emperor's New Mind . Times Literary Supplement (September) 29. ( Cited by 5 | Google ) Abstract: The idea that a computer could be conscious--or equivalently, that human consciousness is the effect of some complex computation mechanically performed by our brains--strikes some scientists and philosophers as a beautiful idea. They find it initially surprising and unsettling, as all beautiful ideas are, but the inevitable culmination of the scientific advances that have gradually demystified and unified the material world. The ideologues of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been its most articulate supporters. To others, this idea is deeply repellent: philistine, reductionistic (in some bad sense), as incredible as it is offensive. John Searle's attack on "strong AI" is the best known expression of this view, but others in the same camp, liking Searle's destination better than his route, would dearly love to see a principled, scientific argument showing that strong AI is impossible. Roger Penrose has set out to provide just such an argument Dennett, Daniel C. (1978). The abilities of men and machines. In Brainstorms . MIT Press.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â GÃ¶del's Theorem is often used in arguments against machine intelligence, suggesting humans are not bound by the rules of any formal system. However, GÃ¶delian arguments can be used to support AI, provided we extend our notion of computation to include devices incorporating random number generators. A complete description scheme can be given for integer functions, by which nonalgorithmic functions are shown to be partly random. Not being restricted to algorithms can be accounted for by the availability of an arbitrary random function. Humans, then, might not be rule-bound, but GÃ¶delian arguments also suggest how the relevant sort of nonalgorithmicity may be trivially made available to machines Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/t36552h6169u6mp8/fulltext.pdf Feferman, S. (1996). Penrose's Godelian argument. Psyche 2:21-32. ( Google ) Abstract: In his book Shadows of the Mind: A search for the missing science of con- sciousness [SM below], Roger Penrose has turned in another bravura perfor- mance, the kind we have come to expect ever since The Emperorâs New Mind [ENM ] appeared. In the service of advancing his deep convictions and daring conjectures about the nature of human thought and consciousness, Penrose has once more drawn a wide swath through such topics as logic, computa- tion, artiï¬cial intelligence, quantum physics and the neuro-physiology of the brain, and has produced along the way many gems of exposition of diï¬cult mathematical and scientiï¬c ideas, without condescension, yet which should be broadly appealing. 1 While the aims and a number of the topics in SM are the same as in ENM , the focus now is much more on the two axes that Pen- rose grinds in earnest. Namely, in the ï¬rst part of SM he argues anew and at great length against computational models of the mind and more speciï¬- cally against any account of mathematical thought in computational terms. Then in the second part, he argues that there must be a scientiï¬c account of consciousness but that will require a (still to be found) non-computational extension or modiï¬cation of present-day quantum physics Gaifman, H. (2000). What Godel's incompleteness result does and does not show. Journal of Philosophy 97 (8):462-471. ( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In a recent paper S. McCall adds another link to a chain of attempts to enlist GÃ¶delâs incompleteness result as an argument for the thesis that human reasoning cannot be construed as being carried out by a computer.1 McCallâs paper is undermined by a technical oversight. My concern however is not with the technical point. The argument from GÃ¶delâs result to the no-computer thesis can be made without following McCallâs route; it is then straighter and more forceful. Yet the argument fails in an interesting and revealing way. And it leaves a remainder: if some computer does in fact simulate all our mathematical reasoning, then, in principle, we cannot fully grasp how it works. GÃ¶delâs result also points out a certain essential limitation of self-reflection. The resulting picture parallels, not accidentally, Davidsonâs view of psychology, as a science that in principle must remain âimpreciseâ, not fully spelt out. What is intended here by âfully graspâ, and how all this is related to self-reflection, will become clear at the end of this comment Additional links for this entry: http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2678427.pdf George, A.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Using the GÃ¶del Incompleteness Result for leverage, Roger Penrose has argued that the mechanism for consciousness involves quantum gravitational phenomena, acting through microtubules in neurons. We show that this hypothesis is implausible. First, the GÃ¶del Result does not imply that human thought is in fact non algorithmic. Second, whether or not non algorithmic quantum gravitational phenomena actually exist, and if they did how that could conceivably implicate microtubules, and if microtubules were involved, how that could conceivably implicate consciousness, is entirely speculative. Third, cytoplasmic ions such as calcium and sodium are almost certainly present in the microtubule pore, barring the quantum mechanical effects Penrose envisages. Finally, physiological evidence indicates that consciousness does not directly depend on microtubule properties in any case, rendering doubtful any theory according to which consciousness is generated in the microtubules Additional links for this entry: http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/penrose/penrose.rtf Hadley, Robert F.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In this paper I discuss the topics of mechanism and algorithmicity. I emphasise that a characterisation of algorithmicity such as the Turing machine is iterative; and I argue that if the human mind can solve problems that no Turing machine can, the mind must depend on some non-iterative principle â in fact, Cantor's second principle of generation, a principle of the actual infinite rather than the potential infinite of Turing machines. But as there has been theorisation that all physical systems can be represented by Turing machines, I investigate claims that seem to contradict this: specifically, claims that there are noncomputable phenomena. One conclusion I reach is that if it is believed that the human mind is more than a Turing machine, a belief in a kind of Cartesian dualist gulf between the mental and the physical is concomitant Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/P4761624416HGN82.pdf Kirk, Robert E.

Cambridge University Press. ( Google ) Abstract: In the last few years, off-line simulation has become an increasingly important alternative to standard explanations in cognitive science. The contemporary debate began with Gordon (1986) and Goldman's (1989) off-line simulation account of our capacity to predict behavior. On their view, in predicting people's behavior we take our own decision making system `off line' and supply it with the `pretend' beliefs and desires of the person whose behavior we are trying to predict; we then let the decision maker reach a decision on the basis of these pretend inputs. Figure 1 offers a `boxological' version of the off-line simulation theory of behavior prediction.(1) Lewis, David (1969). Lucas against mechanism. Philosophy 44 (June):231-3.

Abstract: We can imagine a human operator playing a game of one-upmanship against a programmed computer. If the program is Fn, the human operator can print the theorem Gn, which the programmed computer, or, if you prefer, the program, would never print, if it is consistent. This is true for each whole number n, but the victory is a hollow one since a second computer, loaded with program C, could put the human operator out of a job.... It is useless for the `mentalist' to argue that any given program can always be improves since the process for improving programs can presumably be programmed also; certainly this can be done if the mentalist describes how the improvement is to be made.

Abstract: Goedel's theorem states that in any consistent system which is strong enough to produce simple arithmetic there are formulae which cannot be proved-in-the-system, but which we can see to be true. Essentially, we consider the formula which says, in effect, "This formula is unprovable-in-the-system". If this formula were provable-in-the-system, we should have a contradiction: for if it were provablein-the-system, then it would not be unprovable-in-the-system, so that "This formula is unprovable-in-the-system" would be false: equally, if it were provable-in-the-system, then it would not be false, but would be true, since in any consistent system nothing false can be provedin-the-system, but only truths. So the formula "This formula is unprovable-in-the-system" is not provable-in-the-system, but unprovablein-the-system. Further, if the formula "This formula is unprovablein- the-system" is unprovable-in-the-system, then it is true that that formula is unprovable-in-the-system, that is, "This formula is unprovable-in-the-system" is true. Goedel's theorem must apply to cybernetical machines, because it is of the essence of being a machine, that it should be a concrete instantiation of a formal system. It follows that given any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple arithmetic, there is a formula which it is incapable of producing as being true---i.e., the formula is unprovable-in-the-system-but which we can see to be true. It follows that no machine can be a complete or adequate model of the mind, that minds are essentially different from machines Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/356/1/lucas.html Lucas, John R.

Alan Turing and the mathematical objection. Minds and Machines 13 (1):23-48. ( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: This paper concerns Alan Turingâs ideas about machines, mathematical methods of proof, and intelligence. By the late 1930s, Kurt GÃ¶del and other logicians, including Turing himself, had shown that no finite set of rules could be used to generate all true mathematical statements. Yet according to Turing, there was no upper bound to the number of mathematical truths provable by intelligent human beings, for they could invent new rules and methods of proof. So, the output of a human mathematician, for Turing, was not a computable sequence (i.e., one that could be generated by a Turing machine). Since computers only contained a finite number of instructions (or programs), one might argue, they could not reproduce human intelligence. Turing called this the âmathematical objectionâ to his view that machines can think. Logico-mathematical reasons, stemming from his own work, helped to convince Turing that it should be possible to reproduce human intelligence, and eventually compete with it, by developing the appropriate kind of digital computer. He felt it should be possible to program a computer so that it could learn or discover new rules, overcoming the limitations imposed by the incompleteness and undecidability results in the same way that human mathematicians presumably do.

( Google ) Abstract: Storrs McCall continues the tradition of Lucas and Penrose in an attempt to refute mechanism by appealing to GÃ¶delâs incompleteness theorem (McCall 2001). That is, McCall argues that GÃ¶delâs theorem âreveals a sharp dividing line between human and machine thinkingâ. According to McCall, â[h]uman beings are familiar with the distinction between truth and theoremhood, but Turing machines cannot look beyond their own outputâ. However, although McCallâs argumentation is slightly more sophisticated than the earlier GÃ¶delian anti-mechanist arguments, in the end it fails badly, as it is at odds with the logical facts Raatikainen, Panu (2005). On the philosophical relevance of gÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. Revue Internationale de Philosophie 59 (4):513-534. ( Google ) Abstract: GÃ¶del began his 1951 Gibbs Lecture by stating: âResearch in the foundations of mathematics during the past few decades has produced some results which seem to me of interest, not only in themselves, but also with regard to their implications for the traditional philosophical problems about the nature of mathematics.â (GÃ¶del 1951) GÃ¶del is referring here especially to his own incompleteness theorems (GÃ¶del 1931). GÃ¶delâs first incompleteness theorem (as improved by Rosser (1936)) says that for any consistent formalized system F, which contains elementary arithmetic, there exists a sentence GF of the language of the system which is true but unprovable in that system. GÃ¶delâs second incompleteness theorem states that no consistent formal system can prove its own consistency Raatikainen, Panu (2005). Truth and provability: A comment on Redhead.

They certainly re-state the main claims of Redhead ([2004]), but they do not give any real arguments in their favour, and do not provide anything that would save Redheadâs argument from the serious problems pointed out in (Raatikainen [2005]). Instead, Lucas and Redhead make a number of seemingly irrelevant points, perhaps indicating a failure to understand the logico-mathematical points at issue Redhead, M. (2004).

This paper examines the case of mathematics. As a result of the work of GÃ¶del and Tarski we know that truth does not equate with proof. This has been used by Lucas and Penrose to argue that human minds can do things which digital computers can't, viz to know the truth of unprovable arithmetical statements. The argument is given a simple formulation in the context of sorites (Robinson) arithmetic, avoiding the complexities of formulating the GÃ¶del sentence. The pros and cons of the argument are considered in relation to the conception of mathematical truth. * Paper contributed to the Conference entitled The Place of Value in a World of Facts, held at the LSE in October 2003 Additional links for this entry: http://bjps.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/55/4/731 http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/55/4/731 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/phisci/2004/00000055/00000004/art00731 Robinson, William S.

( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â G. Priest's anti-consistency argument (Priest 1979, 1984, 1987) and J. R. Lucas's anti-mechanist argument (Lucas 1961, 1968, 1970, 1984) both appeal to GÃ¶del incompleteness. By way of refuting them, this paper defends the thesis of quartet compatibility, viz., that the logic of the mind can simultaneously be GÃ¶del incomplete, consistent, mechanical, and recursion complete (capable of all means of recursion). A representational approach is pursued, which owes its origin to works by, among others, J. Myhill (1964), P. Benacerraf (1967), J. Webb (1980, 1983) and M. Arbib (1987). It is shown that the fallacy shared by the two arguments under discussion lies in misidentifying two systems, the one for which the GÃ¶del sentence is constructable and to be proved, and the other in which the GÃ¶del sentence in question is indeed provable. It follows that the logic of the mind can surpass its own GÃ¶delian limitation not by being inconsistent or non-mechanistic, but by being capable of representing stronger systems in itself; and so can a proper machine. The concepts of representational provability, representational maximality, formal system capacity, etc., are discussed Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/X073727543G61372.pdf 6.1c The Chinese Room Adam, Alison (2003).

Abstract: Â Â Searle's Chinese Room was supposed to prove that computers can't understand: the man in the room, following, like a computer, syntactical rules alone, though indistinguishable from a genuine Chinese speaker, doesn't understand a word. But such a room is impossible: the man won't be able to respond correctly to questions like What is the time?, even though such an ability is indispensable for a genuine Chinese speaker. Several ways to provide the room with the required ability are considered, and it is concluded that for each of these the room will have understanding.

Peirce and formalization of thought: The chinese room argument. Journal of Mind and Behavior . ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Whether human thinking can be formalized and whether machines can think in a human sense are questions that have been addressed by both Peirce and Searle. Peirce came to roughly the same conclusion as Searle, that the digital computer would not be able to perform human thinking or possess human understanding. However, his rationale and Searle's differ on several important points. Searle approaches the problem from the standpoint of traditional analytic philosophy, where the strict separation of syntax and semantics renders understanding impossible for a purely syntactical device. Peirce disagreed with that analysis, but argued that the computer would only be able to achieve algorithmic thinking, which he considered the simplest type. Although their approaches were radically dissimilar, their conclusions were not. I will compare and analyze the arguments of both Peirce and Searle on this issue, and outline some implications of their conclusions for the field of Artificial Intelligence Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001002/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/10/02/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001002/00/Peirce_Paper.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1002 http://cogprints.org/1002/1/Peirce_Paper.html http://cogprints.org/1002/0/Peirce_Paper.html Button, Graham ; Coutler, Jeff Lee, John R.

( Cited by 29 | Annotation | Google | More links ) Gives an account of symbolic vs. subsymbolic computation, and argues that the latter is less vulnerable to the Chinese-room intuition, as representations there are not computational tokens. Abstract: More than a decade ago, philosopher John Searle started a long-running controversy with his paper âMinds, Brains, and Programsâ (Searle, 1980a), an attack on the ambitious claims of artificial intelligence (AI). With his now famous _Chinese Room_ argument, Searle claimed to show that despite the best efforts of AI researchers, a computer could never recreate such vital properties of human mentality as intentionality, subjectivity, and understanding. The AI research program is based on the underlying assumption that all important aspects of human cognition may in principle be captured in a computational model. This assumption stems from the belief that beyond a certain level, implementational details are irrelevant to cognition. According to this belief, neurons, and biological wetware in general, have no preferred status as the substrate for a mind. As it happens, the best examples of minds we have at present have arisen from a carbon-based substrate, but this is due to constraints of evolution and possibly historical accidents, rather than to an absolute metaphysical necessity. As a result of this belief, many cognitive scientists have chosen to focus not on the biological substrate of the mind, but instead on the abstract causal structure_ _that the mind embodies (at an appropriate level of abstraction). The view that it is abstract causal structure that is essential to mentality has been an implicit assumption of the AI research program since Turing (1950), but was first articulated explicitly, in various forms, by Putnam (1960), Armstrong (1970) and Lewis (1970), and has become known as _functionalism_. From here, it is a very short step to _computationalism_, the view that computational structure is what is important in capturing the essence of mentality. This step follows from a belief that any abstract causal structure can be captured computationally: a belief made plausible by the ChurchâTuring Thesis, which articulates the power Additional links for this entry: http://consc.net/papers/subsymbolic.pdf http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chalmers92subsymbolic.html http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/subsymbolic.pdf Churchland, Paul M.

Abstract: Â Â Considerations of personal identity bear on John Searle's Chinese Room argument, and on the opposed position that a computer itself could really understand a natural language. In this paper I develop the notion of a virtual person, modelled on the concept of virtual machines familiar in computer science. I show how Searle's argument, and J. Maloney's attempt to defend it, fail. I conclude that Searle is correct in holding that no digital machine could understand language, but wrong in holding that artificial minds are impossible: minds and persons are not the same as the machines, biological or electronic, that realize them Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/t130331427116747/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/T130331427116747.pdf Cole, David J.

Zombies in Searle's chinese room: Putting the Turing test to bed. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Searleâs discussions over the years 1980-2004 of the implications of his âChinese Roomâ Gedanken experiment are frustrating because they proceed from a correct assertion: (1) âInstantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality;â and an incorrect assertion: (2) âThe explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program.â In this article, I describe how to construct a Gedanken zombie Chinese Room program that will pass the Turing test and at the same time unambiguously demonstrates the correctness of (1). I then describe how to construct a Gedanken Chinese brain program that will pass the Turing test, has a mind, and understands Chinese, thus demonstrating that (2) is incorrect. Searleâs instantiation of this program can and does produce intentionality. Searleâs longstanding ignorance of Chinese is simply irrelevant and always has been.

(2006). The logic of Searle's chinese room argument. Minds and Machines 16 (2):163-183. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: John Searleâs Chinese room argument (CRA) is a celebrated thought experiment designed to refute the hypothesis, popular among artificial intelligence (AI) scientists and philosophers of mind, that âthe appropriately programmed computer really is a mindâ. Since its publication in 1980, the CRA has evoked an enormous amount of debate about its implications for machine intelligence, the functionalist philosophy of mind, theories of consciousness, etc. Although the general consensus among commentators is that the CRA is flawed, and not withstanding the popularity of the systems reply in some quarters, there is remarkably little agreement on exactly how and why it is flawed. A newcomer to the controversy could be forgiven for thinking that the bewildering collection of diverse replies to Searle betrays a tendency to unprincipled, ad hoc argumentation and, thereby, a weakness in the oppositionâs case. In this paper, treating the CRA as a prototypical example of a âdestructiveâ thought experiment, I attempt to set it in a logical framework (due to Sorensen), which allows us to systematise and classify the various objections. Since thought experiments are always posed in narrative form, formal logic by itself cannot fully capture the controversy. On the contrary, much also hinges on how one translates between the informal everyday language in which the CRA was initially framed and formal logic and, in particular, on the specific conception(s) of possibility that one reads into the logical formalism Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2006/00000016/00000002/00009031 Dennett, Daniel C.

Abstract: Searle's celebrated Chinese Room Argument has shaken the foundations of Artificial Intelligence. Many refutations have been attempted, but none seem convincing. This paper is an attempt to sort out explicitly the assumptions and the logical, methodological and empirical points of disagreement. Searle is shown to have underestimated some features of computer modeling, but the heart of the issue turns out to be an empirical question about the scope and limits of the purely symbolic (computational) model of the mind. Nonsymbolic modeling turns out to be immune to the Chinese Room Argument. The issues discussed include the Total Turing Test, modularity, neural modeling, robotics, causality and the symbol-grounding problem Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/1573/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/1891/ http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/1891/ http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/harnad89minds.html http://cogprints.org/1573/00/harnad89.searle.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001573/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001622/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/73/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/73/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/1891/01/harnad89.searle.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/5942/01/harnad00.searle.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/1891/01/harnad89.searle.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad00.searle.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad00.searle.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00005942/01/harnad00.searle.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001622/00/harnad00.searle.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001573/00/harnad89.searle.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001573/00/harnad89.searle.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1573 http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=2229271CI http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1573 http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/ieg/e-library/sources/harnad89_searle.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/777580727.pdf http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Eharnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad89.searle.html http://cogprints.org/1573/1/harnad89.searle.html http://cogprints.org/1573/0/harnad89.searle.html Harnad, Stevan (2003).

Since evidence of AI is not bad, arguments against seem called for. John Searle's Chinese Room Argument (1980a, 1984, 1990, 1994) is among the most famous and long-running would-be answers to the call. Surprisingly, both the original thought experiment (1980a) and Searle's later would-be formalizations of the embedding argument (1984, 1990) are quite unavailing against AI proper (claims that computers do or someday will think ). Searle lately even styles it a "misunderstanding" (1994, p. 547) to think the argument was ever so directed! The Chinese room is now advertised to target Computationalism (claims that computation is what thought essentially is ) exclusively. Despite its renown, the Chinese Room Argument is totally ineffective even against this target Hauser, Larry (1993). Searle's Chinese Box: The Chinese Room Argument and Artificial Intelligence.

( Cited by 17 | Google | More links ) Abstract: John Searle's Chinese room argument is perhaps the most influential and widely cited argument against artificial intelligence (AI). Understood as targeting AI proper -- claims that computers can think or do think -- Searle's argument, despite its rhetorical flash, is logically and scientifically a dud. Advertised as effective against AI proper, the argument, in its main outlines, is an ignoratio elenchi. It musters persuasive force fallaciously by indirection fostered by equivocal deployment of the phrase "strong AI" and reinforced by equivocation on the phrase "causal powers (at least) equal to those of brains." On a more carefully crafted understanding -- understood just to target metaphysical identification of thought with computation ("Functionalism" or "Computationalism") and not AI proper -- the argument is still unsound, though more interestingly so. It's unsound in ways difficult for high church -- "someday my prince of an AI program will come" -- believers in AI to acknowledge without undermining their high church beliefs. The ad hominem bite of Searle's argument against the high church persuasions of so many cognitive scientists, I suggest, largely explains the undeserved repute this really quite disreputable argument enjoys among them Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/240/00/199802002.html http://members.aol.com/lshauser/chiboxab.html http://members.aol.com/lshauser2/chinabox.html http://members.aol.com/wutsamada/disserta.html http://members.aol.com/lshauser/chiboxab.html http://members.aol.com/wutsamada/contents.html http://members.aol.com/lshauser2/chinabox.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000240/ http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596705.596737 http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/02/40/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/02/40/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000240/00/199802002.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:240 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:240 http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=322378CI http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=322378CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/kx8r435770352167/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=120195=1 http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=120195=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/KX8R435770352167.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/KX8R435770352167.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000002/00120195 http://cogprints.org/240/1/199802002.html http://cogprints.org/240/0/199802002.html Hauser, Larry (online).

Virtual symposium on virtual mind. [Journal (Paginated)] 2 (3):217-238. ( Cited by 21 | Annotation | Google | More links ) A discussion about the Chinese room, symbol grounding, and so on. Abstract: When certain formal symbol systems (e.g., computer programs) are implemented as dynamic physical symbol systems (e.g., when they are run on a computer) their activity can be interpreted at higher levels (e.g., binary code can be interpreted as LISP, LISP code can be interpreted as English, and English can be interpreted as a meaningful conversation). These higher levels of interpretability are called "virtual" systems. If such a virtual system is interpretable as if it had a mind, is such a "virtual mind" real? This is the question addressed in this "virtual" symposium, originally conducted electronically among four cognitive scientists: Donald Perlis, a computer scientist, argues that according to the computationalist thesis, virtual minds are real and hence Searle's Chinese Room Argument fails, because if Searle memorized and executed a program that could pass the Turing Test in Chinese he would have a second, virtual, Chinese-understanding mind of which he was unaware (as in multiple personality). Stevan Harnad, a psychologist, argues that Searle's Argument is valid, virtual minds are just hermeneutic overinterpretations, and symbols must be grounded in the real world of objects, not just the virtual world of interpretations. Computer scientist Patrick Hayes argues that Searle's Argument fails, but because Searle does not really implement the program: A real implementation must not be homuncular but mindless and mechanical, like a computer. Only then can it give rise to a mind at the virtual level. Philosopher Ned Block suggests that there is no reason a mindful implementation would not be a real one Additional links for this entry: http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/3371/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003371/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003371/ http://cogprints.org/1585/00/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/85/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/85/ http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003371/02/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001585/00/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001585/00/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:3371 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1585 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1585 http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2063372459ww766/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/G2063372459WW766.pdf http://cogprints.org/1585/1/harnad92.virtualmind.html http://cogprints.org/1585/0/harnad92.virtualmind.html Hofstadter, Douglas R.

Searle's problem of the Chinese Room poses an important philosophical challenge to the foundations of strong artificial intelligence, and functionalist, cognitivist, and computationalist theories of mind. Searle has recently responded to three categories of criticisms of the Chinese Room and the consequences he attempts to conclude from it, redescribing the essential features of the problem, and offering new arguments about the syntax-semantics gap it is intended to demonstrate. Despite Searle's defense, the Chinese Room remains ineffective as a counterexample, and poses no real threat to artificial intelligence or mechanist philosophy of mind.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Psychologists and philosophers have recently been exploring whether the mechanisms which underlie the acquisition of âtheory of mindâ (ToM) are best charac- terized as cognitive modules or as developing theories. In this paper, we attempt to clarify what a modular account of ToM entails, and why it is an attractive type of explanation. Intuitions and arguments in this debate often turn on the role of develop- ment: traditional research on ToM focuses on various developmental sequences, whereas cognitive modules are thought to be static and âanti-developmentalâ. We suggest that this mistaken view relies on an overly limited notion of modularity, and we explore how ToM might be grounded in a cognitive module and yet still afford development. Modules must âcome on-lineâ, and even fully developed modules may still develop internally, based on their constrained input. We make these points con- crete by focusing on a recent proposal to capture the development of ToM in a module via parameterization Additional links for this entry: http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/scholl.pdf http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/99-Scholl-Leslie-MindLang.pdf http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/99-Scholl-Leslie-MindLang.pdf http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~duck/ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/scholl.pdf http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0017.00106?favorite=add http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/1468-0017.00106 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/mila/1999/00000014/00000001/art00106 Maloney, J.

Strong AI is rather easy to refute and the basic argument can be summarized in one sentence: {it a system, me for example, could implement a program for understanding Chinese, for example, without understanding any Chinese at all.} This idea, when developed, became known as the Chinese Room Argument.'' The Chinese Room Argument can be refuted in one sentence Melnyk, Andrew (1996). Searle's abstract argument against strong AI. Synthese 108 (3):391-419. ( Cited by 6 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Discussion of Searle's case against strong AI has usually focused upon his Chinese Room thought-experiment. In this paper, however, I expound and then try to refute what I call his abstract argument against strong AI, an argument which turns upon quite general considerations concerning programs, syntax, and semantics, and which seems not to depend on intuitions about the Chinese Room. I claim that this argument fails, since it assumes one particular account of what a program is. I suggest an alternative account which, however, cannot play a role in a Searle-type argument, and argue that Searle gives no good reason for favoring his account, which allows the abstract argument to work, over the alternative, which doesn't. This response to Searle's abstract argument also, incidentally, enables the Robot Reply to the Chinese Room to defend itself against objections Searle makes to it Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/V404X74W610N4UMX.pdf Mitchell, Ethan (2008).

( Cited by 2 | Annotation | Google ) A program can possess intentionality, even if not consciousness. Abstract: John Searle has argued that one can imagine embodying a machine running any computer program without understanding the symbols, and hence that purely computational processes do not yield understanding. The disagreement this argument has generated stems, I hold, from ambiguity in talk of 'understanding'. The concept is analysed as a relation between subjects and symbols having two components: a formal and an intentional. The central question, then becomes whether a machine could possess the intentional component with or without the formal component. I argue that the intentional state of a symbol's being meaningful to a subject is a functionally definable relation between the symbol and certain past and present states of the subject, and that a machine could bear this relation to a symbol. I sketch a machine which could be said to possess, in primitive form, the intentional component of understanding. Even if the machine, in lacking consciousness, lacks full understanding, it contributes to a theory of understanding and constitutes a counterexample to the Chinese Room argument Obermeier, K. K.

This essay considers real-life approximations of Chinese Rooms, focusing on Helen Kellerâs experiences growing up deaf and blind, locked in a sort of Chinese Room yet learning how to communicate with the outside world. Using the SNePS computational knowledge-representation system, the essay analyzes Kellerâs belief that learning that âeverything has a nameâ was the key to her success, enabling her to âpartitionâ her mental concepts into mental representations of: words, objects, and the naming relations between them. It next looks at Herbert Terraceâs theory of naming, which is akin to Kellerâs, and which only humans are supposed to be capable of. The essay suggests that computers at least, and perhaps non-human primates, are also capable of this kind of naming Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/601p84g288756774/fulltext.pdf Rapaport, William J.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Strong Al presupposes (1) that Super-Searle (henceforth âSearleâ) comes to know that the symbols he manipulates are meaningful , and (2) that there cannot be two or more semantical interpretations for the system of symbols that Searle manipulates such that the set of rules constitutes a language comprehension program for each interpretation. In this paper, I show that Strong Al is false and that presupposition #1 is false, on the assumption that presupposition #2 is true. The main argument of the paper constructs a second program, isomorphic to Searleâs, to show that if someone, say Dan, runs this isomorphic program, he cannot possibly come to know what its mentioned symbols mean because they do not mean anything to anybody. Since Dan and Searle do exactly the same thing, except that the symbols they manipulate are different, neither Dan nor Searle can possibly know whether the symbols they manipulate are meaningful (let alone what they mean, if they are meaningful). The remainder of the paper responds to an anticipated Strong Al rejoinder, which, I believe, is a necessary extension of Strong Al Additional links for this entry: http://transactionpub.metapress.com/index/H82MP6R2L10H0745.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/H82MP6R2L10H0745.pdf Russow, L-M.

Abstract: What psychological and philosophical significance should we attach to recent efforts at computer simulations of human cognitive capacities? In answering this question, I find it useful to distinguish what I will call "strong" AI from "weak" or "cautious" AI (artificial intelligence). According to weak AI, the principal value of the computer in the study of the mind is that it gives us a very powerful tool. For example, it enables us to formulate and test hypotheses in a more rigorous and precise fashion. But according to strong AI, the computer is not merely a tool in the study of the mind; rather, the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to..

( Google ) Abstract: Searleâs Chinese Room Argument (CRA) has been the object of great interest in the philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence and cognitive science since its initial presentation in âMinds, Brains and Programsâ in 1980. It is by no means an overstatement to assert that it has been a main focus of attention for philosophers and computer scientists of many stripes. It is then especially interesting to note that relatively little has been said about the detailed logic of the argument, whatever significance Searle intended CRA to have. The problem with the CRA is that it involves a very strong modal claim, the truth of which is both unproved and highly questionable. So it will be argued here that the CRA does not prove what it was intended to prove Sharvy, Richard (1985). Searle on programs and intentionality. Canadian Journal of Philosophy 11:39-54.

( Google ) Abstract: The paper is concerned with John Searleâs famous Chinese room argument. Despite being objected to by some, Searleâs Chinese room argument appears very appealing. This is because Searleâs argument is based on an intuition about the mind that âweâ all seem to share. Ironically, however, Chinese philosophers donât seem to share this same intuition. The paper begins by first analysing Searleâs Chinee room argument. It then introduces what can be seen as the (implicit) Chinese view of the mind. Lastly, it demonstrates a conceptual difference between Chinese and Western philosophy with respect to the notion of mind. Thus, it is shown that one must carefully attend to the presuppositions underlying Chinese philosophising in interpreting Chinese philosophers Taylor, John G. (2003).

( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Searle's Chinese room argument is analyzed from a cognitive point of view. The analysis is based on a newly developed model of conceptual integration, the many space model proposed by Fauconnier and Turner. The main point of the analysis is that the central inference constructed in the Chinese room scenario is a result of a dynamic, cognitive activity of conceptual blending, with metaphor defining the basic features of the blending. Two important consequences follow: (1) Searle's recent contention that syntax is not intrinsic to physics turns out to be a slightly modified version of the old Chinese room argument; and (2) the argument itself is still open to debate. It is persuasive but not conclusive, and at bottom it is a topological mismatch in the metaphoric conceptual integration that is responsible for the non-conclusive character of the Chinese room argument Additional links for this entry: http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/PAHW8YBYRV4EF93P.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/PAHW8YBYRV4EF93P.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2000/00000013/00000003/art00003 Thagard, Paul R.

The chinese room argument reconsidered: Essentialism, indeterminacy, and strong AI. Minds and Machines 13 (2):285-319. ( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â I argue that John Searle's (1980) influential Chinese room argument (CRA) against computationalism and strong AI survives existing objections, including Block's (1998) internalized systems reply, Fodor's (1991b) deviant causal chain reply, and Hauser's (1997) unconscious content reply. However, a new ``essentialist'' reply I construct shows that the CRA as presented by Searle is an unsound argument that relies on a question-begging appeal to intuition. My diagnosis of the CRA relies on an interpretation of computationalism as a scientific theory about the essential nature of intentional content; such theories often yield non-intuitive results in non-standard cases, and so cannot be judged by such intuitions. However, I further argue that the CRA can be transformed into a potentially valid argument against computationalism simply by reinterpreting it as an indeterminacy argument that shows that computationalism cannot explain the ordinary distinction between semantic content and sheer syntactic manipulation, and thus cannot be an adequate account of content. This conclusion admittedly rests on the arguable but plausible assumption that thought content is interestingly determinate. I conclude that the viability of computationalism and strong AI depends on their addressing the indeterminacy objection, but that it is currently unclear how this objection can be successfully addressed Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/q76u712262711110/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5115346=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/Q76U712262711110.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2003/00000013/00000002/05115346 Warwick, Kevin (2002).

Toward this end, we express a single agentâs plans as reflexive dialogs in a multi-agent system defined by a virtual machine. We extend this machineâs planning language by introducing two specific operators for reflexive dialogs i.e., conscious and caught for monitoring beliefs and actions, respectively. The possibility to use the same language both to drive a machine and to establish a reflexive communication within the machine itself stands as a key feature of our model. Bringsjord, Selmer (1994).

( Cited by 12 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves. That is, we are extraordinarily complex self-controlling, self-sustaining physical mechanisms, designed over the eons by natural selection, and operating according to the same well-understood principles that govern all the other physical processes in living things: digestive and metabolic processes, self-repair and reproductive processes, for instance. It may be wildly over-ambitious to suppose that human artificers can repeat Nature's triumph, with variations in material, form, and design process, but this is not a deep objection. It is not as if a conscious machine contradicted any fundamental laws of nature, the way a perpetual motion machine does. Still, many skeptics believe--or in any event want to believe--that it will never be done. I wouldn't wager against them, but my reasons for skepticism are mundane, economic reasons, not theoretical reasons Additional links for this entry: http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/concrobt.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000429/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000429/00/concrobt.htm http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:429 Dennett, Daniel C. (1994). The practical requirements for making a conscious robot. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 349:133-46. ( Cited by 25 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Arguments about whether a robot could ever be conscious have been conducted up to now in the factually impoverished arena of what is possible "in principle." A team at MIT of which I am a part is now embarking on a longterm project to design and build a humanoid robot, Cog, whose cognitive talents will include speech, eye-coordinated manipulation of objects, and a host of self-protective, self-regulatory and self-exploring activities. The aim of the project is not to make a conscious robot, but to make a robot that can interact with human beings in a robust and versatile manner in real time, take care of itself, and tell its designers things about itself that would otherwise be extremely difficult if not impossible to determine by examination. Many of the details of Cog's "neural" organization will parallel what is known (or presumed known) about their counterparts in the human brain, but the intended realism of Cog as a model is relatively coarse-grained, varying opportunistically as a function of what we think we know, what we think we can build, and what we think doesn't matter. Much of what we think will of course prove to be mistaken; that is one advantage of real experiments over thought experiments Additional links for this entry: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994RSPTA.349..133D http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/index/L62130158Q786731.pdf http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Py104/dennett.rob.html Duch, WÅodzisÅaw (2005). Brain-inspired conscious computing architecture. Journal of Mind and Behavior 26 (1-2):1-21. ( Cited by 8 | Google | More links ) Abstract: What type of artificial systems will claim to be conscious and will claim to experience qualia? The ability to comment upon physical states of a brain-like dynamical system coupled with its environment seems to be sufficient to make claims. The flow of internal states in such system, guided and limited by associative memory, is similar to the stream of consciousness. Minimal requirements for an artificial system that will claim to be conscious were given in form of specific architecture named articon. Nonverbal discrimination of the working memory states of the articon gives it the ability to experience different qualities of internal states. Analysis of the inner state flows of such a system during typical behavioral process shows that qualia are inseparable from perception and action. The role of consciousness in learning of skills, when conscious information processing is replaced by subconscious, is elucidated. Arguments confirming that phenomenal experience is a result of cognitive processes are presented. Possible philosophical objections based on the Chinese room and other arguments are discussed, but they are insufficient to refute claims articonâs claims. Conditions for genuine understanding that go beyond the Turing test are presented. Articons may fulfill such conditions and in principle the structure of their experiences may be arbitrarily close to human Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/duch05braininspired.html http://www.phys.uni.torun.pl/publications/kmk/03-Brainins.pdf http://www.phys.uni.torun.pl/publications/kmk/03-Brainins.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003319/01/03-Brainins.pdf http://cogprints.org/3319/1/03-Brainins.pdf http://cogprints.org/3319/1/03%2DBrainins.pdf Ettinger, R.

Essential issues of conscious machines. Journal of Consciousness Studies 14 (7):72-84. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: The development of conscious machines faces a number of difficult issues such as the apparent immateriality of mind, qualia and self-awareness. Also consciousness-related cognitive processes such as perception, imagination, motivation and inner speech are a technical challenge. It is foreseen that the development of machine consciousness would call for a system approach; the developer of conscious machines should consider complete systems that integrate the cognitive processes seamlessly and process information in a transparent way with representational and non-representational information-processing modes. An overview of the main issues is given and some possible solutions are outlined Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000007/art00005 Haikonen, Pentti, O.

The question is: which kinds of machines can be conscious? Chances are that robots that can pass the Turing Test -- completely indistinguishable from us in their behavioral capacities -- can be conscious (i.e. feel), but we can never be sure (because of the "other-minds" problem). And we can never know HOW they have minds, because of the "mind/body" problem. We can only know how they pass the Turing Test, but not how, why or whether that makes them feel Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/2460/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7718 http://cogprints.org/5330/1/machine.htm http://cogprints.org/2460/1/machine.htm http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7718/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00007718/ http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/machine.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00002460/ http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/machine.htm http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/machine.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00002460/01/machine.htm http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:2460 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:2460 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2003/00000010/F0020004/1347 http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Eharnad/Temp/machine.htm Henley, Tracy B.

( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Over sixty years ago, Kenneth Craik noted that, if an organism (or an artificial agent) carried 'a small-scale model of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head', it could use the model to behave intelligently. This paper argues that the possible actions might best be represented by interactions between a model of reality and a model of the agent, and that, in such an arrangement, the internal model of the agent might be a transparent model of the sort recently discussed by Metzinger, and so might offer a useful analogue of a conscious entity. The CRONOS project has built a robot functionally similar to a human that has been provided with an internal model of itself and of the world to be used in the way suggested by Craik; when the system is completed, it will be possible to study its operation from the perspective not only of artificial intelligence, but also of machine consciousness Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000007/art00007 Holland, Owen (ed.)

How to psychoanalyze a robot: Unconscious cognition and the evolution of intentionality. Minds and Machines 13 (2):203-212. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â According to a common philosophical distinction, the `original' intentionality, or `aboutness' possessed by our thoughts, beliefs and desires, is categorically different from the `derived' intentionality manifested in some of our artifacts â- our words, books and pictures, for example. Those making the distinction claim that the intentionality of our artifacts is `parasitic' on the `genuine' intentionality to be found in members of the former class of things. In Kinds of Minds: Toward an Understanding of Consciousness, Daniel Dennett criticizes that claim and the distinction it rests on, and seeks to show that ``metaphysically original intentionality'' is illusory by working out the implications he sees in the practical possibility of a certain type of robot, i.e., one that generates `utterances' which are `inscrutable to the robot's designers' so that we, and they, must consult the robot to discover the meaning of its utterances. I argue that the implications Dennett finds are erroneous, regardless of whether such a robot is possible, and therefore that the real existence of metaphysically original intentionality has not been undermined by the possibility of the robot Dennett describes Additional links for this entry: http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5115347=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/U6T815G723R22382.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2003/00000013/00000002/05115347 Lucas, John R.

In experimental studies, ordinary speakers frequently assent to claims that, in certain cases, agents who knowingly behave wrongly intentionally bring about the harm they do; yet the speakers tend to deny that it was the intention of those agents to cause the harm. This paper reports two additional studies that at first appear to support the original ones, but argues that in fact, the evidence of all the studies considered is best understood in terms of the Simple View.

Making robots conscious of their mental states. In S. Muggleton (ed.), Machine Intelligence 15 . Oxford University Press. ( Cited by 68 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In AI, consciousness of self consists in a program having certain kinds of facts about its own mental processes and state of mind. We discuss what consciousness of its own mental structures a robot will need in order to operate in the common sense world and accomplish the tasks humans will give it. It's quite a lot. Many features of human consciousness will be wanted, some will not, and some abilities not possessed by humans have already been found feasible and useful in limited contexts. We give preliminary fragments of a logical language a robot can use to represent information about its own state of mind. A robot will often have to conclude that it cannot decide a question on the basis of the information in memory and therefore must seek information externally. GÃ¶del's idea of relative consistency is used to formalize non-knowledge. Programs with the kind of consciousness discussed in this article do not yet exist, although programs with some components of it exist. Thinking about consciousness with a view to designing it provides a new approach to some of the problems of consciousness studied by philosophers. One advantage is that it focusses on the aspects of consciousness important for intelligent behavior Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/81449.html http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mccarthy95making.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000422/ http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/consciousness.ps http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=647636.733058 http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/consciousness/consciousness.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:422 McDermott, Drew (2007).

We propose to shift the focus to self-consciousness in order to open new areas of investigation.

The folk on know-how: Why radical intellectualism does not over-intellectualize. ( Google ) Abstract: Philosophical discussion of the nature of know-how has focused on the relation between know-how and ability. Broadly speaking, neo-Ryleans attempt to identify know-how with a certain type of ability,1 while, traditionally, intellectualists attempt to reduce it to some form of propositional knowledge. For our purposes, however, this characterization of the debate is too crude. Instead, we prefer the following more explicit taxonomy. Anti-intellectualists, as we will use the term, maintain that knowing how to ? entails the ability to ?. Dispositionalists maintain that the ability to ? is sufficient (modulo some fairly innocuous constraints) for knowing how to ?. Intellectualists, as we will use the term, deny the anti-intellectualist claim. Finally, radical intellectualists deny both the anti-intellectualist and dispositionalist claims. Pace neo-Ryleans (who in our taxonomy are those who accept both dispositionalism and anti-intellectualism), radical intellectualists maintain that the ability to ? is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing how to ?

( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Analytic philosophers have long used a priori methods to characterize folk concepts like knowledge, belief, and wrongness. Recently, researchers have begun to exploit social scientific methodologies to characterize such folk concepts. One line of work has explored folk intuitions on cases that are disputed within philosophy. A second approach, with potentially more radical implications, applies the methods of cross-cultural psychology to philosophical intuitions. Recent work suggests that people in different cultures have systematically different intuitions surrounding folk concepts like wrong, knows, and refers. A third strand of research explores the emergence and character of folk concepts in children. These approaches to characterizing folk concepts provide important resources that will supplement, and perhaps sometimes displace, a priori approaches Additional links for this entry: http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/FolkConcepts.pdf http://matrix.aklab.psych.ubc.ca/uploads/Christine_FolkPhilosophy_TICS.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve=Citation http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed=google http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661304002360 Pinker, Steven (online).

Analyzing the rationale for claiming that the formal manipulation of physical symbols in Turing machines would emulate human thought, the article attempts to show why this proved false. This is because the reinterpretation of designation and meaning to accommodate physical symbol manipulation eliminated their crucial functions in human discourse. Words have denotations and intensional meanings because the brain transforms the physical stimuli received from the microworld into a qualitative, macroscopic representation for consciousness. Lacking this capacity as programmed machines, computers have no representations for their symbols to designate and mean. Unlike human beings in which consciousness and thought, with their inherent content, have emerged because of their organic natures, serial processing computers or parallel distributed processing systems, as programmed electrical machines, lack these causal capacities Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=467237CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/k248165u513p4746/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=187743=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/K248165U513P4746.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1998/00000009/00000001/00187743 Scriven, Michael (1953).

( Google ) Abstract: One of the most important ongoing debates in the philosophy of mind is the debate over the reality of the first-person character of consciousness.[1] Philosophers on one side of this debate hold that some features of experience are accessible only from a first-person standpoint. Some members of this camp, notably Frank Jackson, have maintained that epiphenomenal properties play roles in consciousness [2]; others, notably John R. Searle, have rejected dualism and regarded mental phenomena as entirely biological.[3] In the opposite camp are philosophers who hold that all mental capacities are in some sense computational - or, more broadly, explainable in terms of features of information processing systems.[4] Consistent with this explanatory agenda, members of this camp normally deny that any aspect of mind is accessible solely from a first-person standpoint. This denial sometimes goes very far - even as far as Dennett's claim that the phenomenology of conscious experience does not really exist Simon, Michael A. (1969).

( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Machine consciousness exists already in organic systems and it is only a matter of time -- and some agreement -- before it will be realised in reverse-engineered organic systems and forward- engineered inorganic systems. The agreement must be over the preconditions that must first be met if the enterprise is to be successful, and it is these preconditions, for instance, being a socially-embedded, structurally-coupled and dynamic, goal-directed entity that organises its perceptual input and enacts its world through the application of both a cognitive and kinaesthetic imagination, that I shall concentrate on presenting in this paper. It will become clear that these preconditions will present engineers with a tall order, but not, I will argue, an impossible one. After all, we might agree with Freeman and NÃºÃ±ez's claim that the machine metaphor has restricted the expectations of the cognitive sciences (Freeman & NÃºÃ±ez, 1999); but it is a double-edged sword, since our limited expectations about machines also narrow the potential of our cognitive science Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000007/art00010 Stubenberg, Leopold (1992).

Abstract: Â Â Oscar is going to be the first artificial person â at any rate, he is going to be the first artificial person to be built in Tucson's Philosophy Department. Oscar's creator, John Pollock, maintains that once Oscar is complete he will experience qualia, will be self-conscious, will have desires, fears, intentions, and a full range of mental states (Pollock 1989, pp. ixâx). In this paper I focus on what seems to me to be the most problematical of these claims, viz., that Oscar will experience qualia. I argue that we have not been given sufficient reasons to believe this bold claim. I doubt that Oscar will enjoy qualitative conscious phenomena and I maintain that it will be like nothing to be Oscar Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/M60825350X345117.pdf Tagliasco, Vincenzo (2007).

( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Current approaches to machine consciousness (MC) tend to offer a range of characteristic responses to critics of the enterprise. Many of these responses seem to marginalize phenomenal consciousness, by presupposing a 'thin' conception of phenomenality. This conception is, we will argue, largely shared by anti- computationalist critics of MC. On the thin conception, physiological or neural or functional or organizational features are secondary accompaniments to consciousness rather than primary components of consciousness itself. We outline an alternative, 'thick' conception of phenomenality. This shows some signposts in the direction of a more adequate approach to MC Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000007/art00011 Tson, M. E.

( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The central paradigm of arti?cial intelligence is rapidly shifting toward biological models for both robotic devices and systems performing such critical tasks as network management, vehicle navigation, and process control. Here we use a recent mathematical analysis of the necessary conditions for consciousness in humans to explore likely failure modes inherent to a broad class of biologically inspired computing machines. Analogs to developmental psychopathology, in which regulatory mechanisms for consciousness fail progressively and subtly understress, and toinattentional blindness, where a narrow 'syntactic band pass' de?ned by the rate distortion manifold of conscious attention results in pathological ?xation, seem inevitable. Similar problems are likely to confront other possible architectures, although their mathematical description may be far less straightforward. Computing devices constructed on biological paradigms will inevitably lack the elaborate, but poorly understood, system of control mechanisms which has evolved over the last few hundred million years to stabilize consciousness in higher animals. This will make such machines prone to insidious degradation, and, ultimately, catastrophic failure Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/mm/2006/00000004/00000001/art00004 Ziff, P.

Dennett's overlooked originality. Minds and Machines 16 (1):43-55. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: No philosopher has worked harder than Dan Dennett to set the possibility of machine mentality on firm philosophical footing. Dennettâs defense of this possibility has both a positive and a negative thrust. On the positive side, he has developed an account of mental activity that is tailor-made for the attribution of intentional states to purely mechanical contrivances, while on the negative side, he pillories as mystery mongering and skyhook grasping any attempts to erect barriers to the conception of machine mentality by excavating gulfs to keep us âbona fideâ thinkers apart from the rest of creation. While I think heâs âwonâ the rhetorical tilts with his philosophical adversaries, I worry that Dennettâs negative side sometimes gets the better of him, and that this obscures advances that can be made on the positive side of his program. In this paper, I show that Dennett is much too dismissive of original intentionality in particular, and that this notion can be put to good theoretical use after all. Though deployed to distinguish different grades of mentality, it can (and should) be incorporated into a philosophical account of the mind that is recognizably Dennettian in spirit Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/3M13835807176130.pdf Beloff, John (2002).

Minds and machines. American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly 66 (1):57-80. ( Cited by 3 | Google ) Abstract: The emergence of electronic computers in the last thirty years has given rise to many interesting questions. Many of these questions are technical, relating to a machineâs ability to perform complex operations in a variety of circumstances. While some of these questions are not without philosophical interest, the one question which above all others has stimulated philosophical interest is explicitly non-technical and it can be expressed crudely as follows: Can a machine be said to think and, if so, in what sense? The issue has received much attention in the scholarly journals with articles and arguments appearing in great profusion, some resolutely answering this question in the affirmative, some, equally resolutely, answering this question in the negative, and others manifesting modified rapture. While the ramifications of the question are enormous I believe that the issue at the heart of the matter has gradually emerged from the forest of complications Cherry, Christopher (1991).

( Google ) Abstract: For two hundred years materialist philosophers have argued that man is some sort of machine. The claim began with French materialists of the Enlightenment such as Pierre Cabanis, Julien La Mettrie, and Baron dâHolbach (La Mettrie even wrote a book titled Man the Machine). Likewise contemporary materialists like Marvin Minsky, Daniel Dennett, and Patricia Churchland claim that the motions and modifications of matter are sufficient to account for all human experiences, even our interior and cognitive ones. Whereas the Enlightenment philosophes might have thought of humans in terms of gear mechanisms and fluid flows, contemporary materialists think of humans in terms of neurological systems and computational devices.

I have a yellowed clipping dated 12/9/81 from the Philadelphia Inquirer--not the National Enquirer--with the headline: Robot killed repairman, Japan reports The story was an anti-climax: at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries plant in Akashi, a malfunctioning robotic arm pushed a repairman against a gearwheel-milling machine, crushing him to death. The repairman had failed to follow proper instructions for shutting down the arm before entering the workspace. Why, indeed, had this industrial accident in Japan been reported in a Philadelphia newspaper? Every day somewhere in the world a human worker is killed by one machine or another. The difference, of course, was that in the public imagination at least, this was no ordinary machine; this was a robot, a machine that might have a mind, might have evil intentions, might be capable not just of homicide but of murder Dretske, Fred (1993).

Canadian Journal of Philosophy 26 (1):101-22. ( Cited by 3 | Google ) Abstract: I critically examine some provocative arguments that John Searle presents in his book The Rediscovery of Mind to support the claim that the syntactic states of a classical computational system are observer relative or mind dependent or otherwise less than fully and objectively real. I begin by explaining how this claim differs from Searle's earlier and more well-known claim that the physical states of a machine, including the syntactic states, are insufficient to determine its semantics. In contrast, his more recent claim concerns the syntax, in particular, whether a machine actually has symbols to underlie its semantics. I then present and respond to a number of arguments that Searle offers to support this claim, including whether machine symbols are observer relative because the assignment of syntax is arbitrary, or linked to universal realizability, or linked to the sub-personal interpretive acts of a homunculus, or linked to a person's consciousness. I conclude that a realist about the computational model need not be troubled by such arguments. Their key premises need further support. Fisher, Mark (1983).

( Cited by 5 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Do computers have beliefs? I argue that anyone who answers in the affirmative holds a view that is incompatible with what I shall call the commonsense approach to the propositional attitudes. My claims shall be two. First,the commonsense view places important constraints on what can be acknowledged as a case of having a belief. Second, computers â at least those for which having a belief would be conceived as having a sentence in a belief box â fail to satisfy some of these constraints. This second claim can best be brought out in the context of an examination of the idea of computer self-knowledge and self-deception, but the conclusion is perfectly general: the idea that computers are believers, like the idea that computers could have self-knowledge or be self-deceived, is incompatible with the commonsense view. The significance of the argument lies in the choice it forces on us: whether to revise our notion of belief so as to accommodate the claim that computers are believers, or to give up on that claim so as to preserve our pretheoretic notion of the attitudes. We cannot have it both ways Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=316238CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/x67006n334r1n383/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=136245=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/X67006N334R1N383.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000004/00136245 Gomila, Antoni (1995).

And they will add that the difference, which is merely one of degree, does not imply any essential difference; from this they will be quite justified in concluding that, although there may be a smaller degree of reason in the beasts than there is in us, the beasts possess minds which are of exactly the same type as ours.

Minds and Machines 3 (1):3-10. ( Cited by 11 | Google | More links ) Abstract: My pocket calculator (Cal) has certain arithmetical abilities: it seems Cal calculates. That calculating is thinking seems equally untendentious. Yet these two claims together provide premises for a seemingly valid syllogism whose conclusion -- Cal thinks -- most would deny. I consider several ways to avoid this conclusion, and find them mostly wanting. Either we ourselves can't be said to think or calculate if our calculation-like performances are judged by the standards proposed to rule out Cal; or the standards -- e.g., autonomy and self-consciousness -- make it impossible to verify whether anything or anyone (save myself) meets them. While appeals to the intentionality of thought or the unity of minds provide more credible lines of resistance, available accounts of intentionality and mental unity are insufficiently clear and warranted to provide very substantial arguments against Cal's title to be called a thinking thing. Indeed, considerations favoring granting that title are more formidable than generally appreciated Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/242/00/wimpcatt.html http://members.aol.com/lshauser/wimpcatt.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000242/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000242/00/wimpcatt.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:242 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:242 http://www.springerlink.com/content/t46235328605618l/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5383t2m586208l4/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/T46235328605618L.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/K5383T2M586208L4.pdf http://cogprints.org/242/1/wimpcatt.html http://cogprints.org/242/0/wimpcatt.html Heffernan, James D.

Drawing on the distinction between activities and tasks, and the fundamental scientific principles of ontological lawfulness, epistemological realism, and methodological skepticism, we argue for traditional scientific materialism of the emergentist kind in opposition to the functionalism, behaviourism, tacit idealism, and merely decorative materialism of the artificial intelligence and artificial life communities Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/h8731k7036822314/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=390424=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/H8731K7036822314.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2002/00000012/00000001/00390424 Kearns, John T.

I think that what Turing really said was that computing machines â- computers limited to computing â- can only fake intelligence. If we want computers to become genuinelyintelligent, we will have to give them enough initiative (Turing, 1948, p. 21) to do more than compute. In this paper, I want to try to develop this idea. I want to explain how giving computers more ``initiative'''' can allow them to do more than compute. And I want to say why I believe (and believe that Turing believed) that they will have to go beyond computation before they can become genuinely intelligent Additional links for this entry: http://www.cs.bc.edu/~kugel/Publications/Hyper.pdf http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/akl/cisc879/papers/PAPERS_FROM_MINDS_AND_MACHINES/VOLUME_12_NO_4/P8T30NK152182338.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/p8t30nk152182338/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5098145=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/P8T30NK152182338.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2002/00000012/00000004/05098145 Lanier, Jaron (ms). Mindless thought experiments (a critique of machine intelligence).

Here's one old chestnut: "What if you replaced your neurons one by one with neuron sized and shaped substitutes made of silicon chips that perfectly mimicked the chemical and electric functions of the originals? If you just replaced one single neuron, surely you'd feel the same. As you proceed, as more and more neurons are replaced, you'd stay conscious. Why wouldn't you still be conscious at the end of the process, when you'd reside in a brain shaped glob of silicon? And why couldn't the resulting replacement brain have been manufactured by some other means?" Lanier, Jaron (1998). Three objections to the idea of artificial intelligence. In Stuart R.

To be sure, most people also agree that computers can do many things that a person would have to be thinking to do. Then how could a machine seem to think but not actually think? Well, setting aside the question of what thinking actually is, I think that most of us would answer that by saying that in these cases, what the computer is doing is merely a superficial imitation of human intelligence. It has been designed to obey certain simple commands, and then it has been provided with programs composed of those commands. Because of this, the computer has to obey those commands, but without any idea of what's happening Additional links for this entry: http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/ComputersCantThink.txt http://www.cogsci.northwestern.edu/courses/cg207/readings/AIMag03-04-001.pdf http://cs.clarku.edu/~jbreecher/public/2005_Can_Computers_Think/Minsky-WhyPeopleThinkComputersCant.pdf http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~jbreecher/public/2005_Can_Computers_Think/Minsky-WhyPeopleThinkComputersCant.pdf http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/~douglass/Douglass/Agents/TopicPapers/~TopCandidates~/State-of-AI/AIMag03-04-001.pdf Nanay, Bence (2006).

Daniel Dennett chose a surprising strategy for arguing against this asymmetry: instead of denying that the intentionality of computers is derived, he endeavours to argue that human intentionality is derived too. I intend to examine that biological plausibility of Dennettâs suggestion and show that Dennettâs argument for the claim that human intentionality is derived because it was designed by natural selection is based on the misunderstanding of how natural selection works Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/a44653240255k3g2/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/A44653240255K3G2.pdf Negley, Glenn (1951).

Some empirical criteria for attributing creativity to a computer program. Minds and Machines 17 (1). ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Over recent decades there has been a growing interest in the question of whether computer programs are capable of genuinely creative activity. Although this notion can be explored as a purely philosophical debate, an alternative perspective is to consider what aspects of the behaviour of a program might be noted or measured in order to arrive at an empirically supported judgement that creativity has occurred. We sketch out, in general abstract terms, what goes on when a potentially creative program is constructed and run, and list some of the relationships (for example, between input and output) which might contribute to a decision about creativity. Specifically, we list a number of criteria which might indicate interesting properties of a programâs behaviour, from the perspective of possible creativity. We go on to review some ways in which these criteria have been applied to actual implementations, and some possible improvements to this way of assessing creativity Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/873382581451wk27/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/873382581451WK27.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2007/00000017/00000001/00009066 Ronald, E.

We wish herein to consider a different issue altogether: granted that a computing machine passes the Turing Test, thereby earning the label of ``Turing Chatterbox'', would it then be of any use (to us humans)?

The issue herein addressed is philosophically poignant, that of robots that are âpeopleâ. It is currently popular to speak about robots and the image of Man. Behind this lurks the dialogical mind and the questions about the significance of an artificial version of it. Without intending to defend or refute the discourse in favour of ârecreatingâ Man, a lesser familiar question is brought forth: âand what if we were capable of creating a very convincible replica of man (constructing a robot-person), what would the consequences of this be and would we be satisfied with such technology?â Thorny topic; it questions the entire knowledge foundation upon which strong AI/Robotics is positioned.

A case for ascribing quasi-responsibility to computers independent of personhood or agency. Ethics and Information Technology 8 (4):205-213. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: There has been much debate whether computers can be responsible. This question is usually discussed in terms of personhood and personal characteristics, which a computer may or may not possess. If a computer fulfils the conditions required for agency or personhood, then it can be responsible; otherwise not. This paper suggests a different approach. An analysis of the concept of responsibility shows that it is a social construct of ascription which is only viable in certain social contexts and which serves particular social aims. If this is the main aspect of responsibility then the question whether computers can be responsible no longer hinges on the difficult problem of agency but on the possibly simpler question whether responsibility ascriptions to computers can fulfil social goals. The suggested solution to the question whether computers can be subjects of responsibility is the introduction of a new concept, called âquasi-responsibilityâ which will emphasise the social aim of responsibility ascription and which can be applied to computers Additional links for this entry: http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~bstahl/publications/2006_responsible_computers_EIT.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/27607300gt85x46k/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/27607300GT85X46K.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/etin/2006/00000008/00000004/00009112 Tallis, Raymond C.

Indeed, their avatars are fictional bodies with which they act in the virtual world, just as they act in the real world with their physical bodies. Hence their physical bodies can be regarded as their default avatars. I also discuss recent research into "believable" software agents, which are designed on principles borrowed from the character-based arts, especially cinematic animation as practiced by the artists at Disney and Warner Brothers Studios. I claim that these agents exemplify a kind of autonomy that should be of greater interest to philosophers than that exemplified by the generic agent modeled in current philosophical theory. The latter agent is autonomous by virtue of being governed by itself; but a believable agent appears to be governed by a self, which is the anima by which it appears to be animated. Putting these two discussions together, I suggest that philosophers of action should focus their attention on how we animate our bodies Additional links for this entry: http://phonline.org/paper.php?keynum=807 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1006884 Wait, Eldon C.

( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â John Searle distinguished between weak and strong artificial intelligence (AI). This essay discusses a third alternative, mild AI, according to which a machine may be capable of possessing a species of mentality. Using James Fetzer's conception of minds as semiotic systems, the possibility of what might be called ``mild AI'' receives consideration. Fetzer argues against strong AI by contending that digital machines lack the ground relationship required of semiotic systems. In this essay, the implementational nature of semiotic processes posited by Charles S. Peirce's triadic sign relation is re-examined in terms of the underlying dispositional processes and the ontological levels they would span in an inanimate machine. This suggests that, if non-human mentality can be replicated rather than merely simulated in a digital machine, the direction to pursue appears to be that of mild AI Additional links for this entry: http://www.mildai.org/papers/MAM2000-0-DJRW.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/tm143v51k2638028/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=323262=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/TM143V51K2638028.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2001/00000011/00000003/00323262 Wilks, Yorick (1976).

Transduction and degree of grounding. Psycoloquy 12 (36). (Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: While I agree in general with Stevan Harnad's symbol grounding proposal, I do not believe "transduction" (or "analog process") PER SE is useful in distinguishing between what might best be described as different "degrees" of grounding and, hence, for determining whether a particular system might be capable of cognition. By 'degrees of grounding' I mean whether the effects of grounding go "all the way through" or not. Why is transduction limited in this regard? Because transduction is a physical process which does not speak to the issue of representation, and, therefore, does not explain HOW the informational aspects of signals impinging on sensory surfaces become embodied as symbols or HOW those symbols subsequently cause behavior, both of which, I believe, are important to grounding and to a system's cognitive capacity. Immunity to Searle's Chinese Room (CR) argument does not ensure that a particular system is cognitive, and whether or not a particular degree of groundedness enables a system to pass the Total Turing Test (TTT) may never be determined Additional links for this entry: http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/Think/boyle.htm http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad93.symb.anal.net.boyle.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad93.symb.anal.net.boyle.html Bringsjord, Selmer (online).

Material symbols. Philosophical Psychology 19 (3):291-307. ( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: What is the relation between the material, conventional symbol structures that we encounter in the spoken and written word, and human thought? A common assumption, that structures a wide variety of otherwise competing views, is that the way in which these material, conventional symbol-structures do their work is by being translated into some kind of content-matching inner code. One alternative to this view is the tempting but thoroughly elusive idea that we somehow think in some natural language (such as English). In the present treatment I explore a third option, which I shall call the "complementarity" view of language. According to this third view the actual symbol structures of a given language add cognitive value by complementing (without being replicated by) the more basic modes of operation and representation endemic to the biological brain. The "cognitive bonus" that language brings is, on this model, not to be cashed out either via the ultimately mysterious notion of "thinking in a given natural language" or via some process of exhaustive translation into another inner code. Instead, we should try to think in terms of a kind of coordination dynamics in which the forms and structures of a language qua material symbol system play a key and irreducible role. Understanding language as a complementary cognitive resource is, I argue, an important part of the much larger project (sometimes glossed in terms of the "extended mind") of understanding human cognition as essentially and multiply hybrid: as involving a complex interplay between internal biological resources and external non-biological resources Additional links for this entry: http://www.psych.unito.it/csc/cogsci05/frame/talk/plen1-clark.pdf http://data.cstr.ed.ac.uk/internal/library/proceedings/2005/cogsci2005/docs/p1.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~content=a747697830~fulltext=713240930 http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/XNRG5M77H65766ML.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/747697830.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2006/00000019/00000003/art00002 Cummins, Robert E.

Abstract: Connectionism and computationalism are currently vying for hegemony in cognitive modeling. At first glance the opposition seems incoherent, because connectionism is itself computational, but the form of computationalism that has been the prime candidate for encoding the "language of thought" has been symbolic computationalism (Dietrich 1990, Fodor 1975, Harnad 1990c; Newell 1980; Pylyshyn 1984), whereas connectionism is nonsymbolic (Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988, or, as some have hopefully dubbed it, "subsymbolic" Smolensky 1988). This paper will examine what is and is not a symbol system. A hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic system will be sketched in which the meanings of the symbols are grounded bottom-up in the system's capacity to discriminate and identify the objects they refer to. Neural nets are one possible mechanism for learning the invariants in the analog sensory projection on which successful categorization is based. "Categorical perception" (Harnad 1987a), in which similarity space is "warped" in the service of categorization, turns out to be exhibited by both people and nets, and may mediate the constraints exerted by the analog world of objects on the formal world of symbols Additional links for this entry: http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/3374/ http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/3374/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001583/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/83/ http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.symbol.object.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad92.symbol.object.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003374/02/harnad92.symbol.object.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:3374 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1583 http://cogprints.org/1583/1/harnad92.symbol.object.html http://cogprints.org/1583/0/harnad92.symbol.object.html Harnad, Stevan (2002). Symbol grounding and the origin of language. In Matthias Scheutz (ed.), Computationalism: New Directions . MIT Press. ( Cited by 12 | Google | More links ) Abstract: What language allows us to do is to "steal" categories quickly and effortlessly through hearsay instead of having to earn them the hard way, through risky and time-consuming sensorimotor "toil" (trial-and-error learning, guided by corrective feedback from the consequences of miscategorisation). To make such linguistic "theft" possible, however, some, at least, of the denoting symbols of language must first be grounded in categories that have been earned through sensorimotor toil (or else in categories that have already been "prepared" for us through Darwinian theft by the genes of our ancestors); it cannot be linguistic theft all the way down. The symbols that denote categories must be grounded in the capacity to sort, label and interact with the proximal sensorimotor projections of their distal category-members in a way that coheres systematically with their semantic interpretations, both for individual symbols, and for symbols strung together to express truth-value-bearing propositions Additional links for this entry: http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7714/ http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/6471/ http://bi.snu.ac.kr/Courses/4ai05s/Essay/2-06.pdf http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00002133/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/21/33/ http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad02.symlang.htm http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad02.symlang.htm http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00007714/01/harnad02.symlang.htm http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00006471/01/harnad02.symlang.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:7714 Harnad, Stevan (ms). Symbol grounding is an empirical problem: Neural nets are just a candidate component. ( Cited by 27 | Google | More links ) Abstract: "Symbol Grounding" is beginning to mean too many things to too many people. My own construal has always been simple: Cognition cannot be just computation, because computation is just the systematically interpretable manipulation of meaningless symbols, whereas the meanings of my thoughts don't depend on their interpretability or interpretation by someone else. On pain of infinite regress, then, symbol meanings must be grounded in something other than just their interpretability if they are to be candidates for what is going on in our heads. Neural nets may be one way to ground the names of concrete objects and events in the capacity to categorize them (by learning the invariants in their sensorimotor projections). These grounded elementary symbols could then be combined into symbol strings expressing propositions about more abstract categories. Grounding does not equal meaning, however, and does not solve any philosophical problems Additional links for this entry: http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/3367/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003367/ http://cogprints.org/1588/0/harnad93.cogsci.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001588/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/88/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/3367/01/harnad93.cogsci.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/15/88/ http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad93.cogsci.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad93.cogsci.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00001588/00/harnad93.cogsci.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:3367 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1588 http://cogprints.org/1588/1/harnad93.cogsci.html Harnad, Stevan (1990). The symbol grounding problem. [Journal (Paginated)] 42:335-346. ( Cited by 1265 | Annotation | Google | More links ) AI symbols are empty and meaningless. They need to be "grounded" in something, e.g. sensory projection. Maybe connectionism can do the trick? Abstract: There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the symbol grounding problem: How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., An X is a Y that is Z). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic module, however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically dedicated symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded Additional links for this entry: http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.AI/9906002 http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/8175/ http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=96679 http://cogprints.org/3106/1/sgproblem1.html http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/harnad90symbol.html http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00008175/ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999cs........6002H http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/symgro.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003106/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/06/15/ http://cogprints.org/615/00/The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem.html http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/harnad90theSymbol.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003106/01/sgproblem1.html http://cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad90.sgproblem.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad90.sgproblem.html http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/harnad (1990) the symbol grounding problem.pdf http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000615/00/The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem.html http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/%7Eharnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad90.sgproblem.html http://cogprints.org/615/1/The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem.html http://cogprints.org/615/0/The_Symbol_Grounding_Problem.html Kosslyn, Stephen M.

Dialogue 44 (1):87-96. ( Google ) Abstract: One holistic thesis about symbols is that a symbol cannot exist singly, but only as apart of a symbol system. There is also the plausible view that symbol systems emerge gradually in an individual, in a group, and in a species. The problem is that symbol holism makes it hard to see how a symbol system can emerge gradually, at least if we are considering the emergence of a first symbol system. The only way it seems possible is if being a symbol can be a matter of degree, which is initially problematic. This article explains how being a cognitive symbol can be a matter of degree after all. The contrary intuition arises from the way a process of interpretation forces an all-or-nothing character on symbols, leaving room for underlying material to realize symbols to different degrees in a way that Daniel Dennettâs work can help illuminate. Holism applies to symbols as interpreted, while gradualism applies to how the underlying material realizes symbols.Selon une thÃ¨se holistique sur les symboles, un symbole ne peut exister isolÃ©ment mais doit faire partie dâun systÃ©me symbolique. Une opinion, elle aussi plausible, veut que les systÃ¨mes symboliques Ã©mergent graduellement chez un individu, un groupe ou une espÃ¨ce. Le problÃ¨me câest quâon voit mal, si le holisme des systÃ¨mes symboliques tient, comment un systÃ¨me symbolique peut Ã©merger graduellement, du moins pour la premiÃ¨re fois. Ce nâest possible, semble-t-il, que si Ãªtre un symbole est affaire de degrÃ©, thÃ¨se au dÃ©part problÃ©matique. Cet article explique comment Ãªtre un symbole cognitif peut aprÃ¨s tout Ãªtre affaire de degrÃ©. Lâintuition contraire vient de ce que le processus dâinterprÃ©tation nous force au tout ou rien, ce qui laisse un jeu dans la faÃ§on dont le matÃ©riel sous-jacent rÃ©alise les symboles Ã  des degrÃ©s divers. Les travaux de Daniel Dennett sont Ã  cet Ã©gard Ã©clairants.

(1995). Brain symbols and computationalist explanation. Minds and Machines 5 (1):25-44. ( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Computationalist theories of mind require brain symbols, that is, neural events that represent kinds or instances of kinds. Standard models of computation require multiple inscriptions of symbols with the same representational content. The satisfaction of two conditions makes it easy to see how this requirement is met in computers, but we have no reason to think that these conditions are satisfied in the brain. Thus, if we wish to give computationalist explanations of human cognition, without committing ourselvesa priori to a strong and unsupported claim in neuroscience, we must first either explain how we can provide multiple brain symbols with the same content, or explain how we can abandon standard models of computation. It is argued that both of these alternatives require us to explain the execution of complex tasks that have a cognition-like structure. Circularity or regress are thus threatened, unless noncomputationalist principles can provide the required explanations. But in the latter case, we do not know that noncomputationalist principles might not bear most of the weight of explaining cognition. Four possible types of computationalist theory are discussed; none appears to provide a promising solution to the problem. Thus, despite known difficulties in noncomputationalist investigations, we have every reason to pursue the search for noncomputationalist principles in cognitive theory Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/L075451262856X7G.pdf Roitblat, Herbert L. (2001). Computational grounding. Psycoloquy 12 (58). (Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Harnad defines computation to mean the manipulation of physical symbol tokens on the basis of syntactic rules defined over the shapes of the symbols, independent of what, if anything, those symbols represent. He is, of course, free to define terms in any way that he chooses, and he is very clear about what he means by computation, but I am uncomfortable with this definition. It excludes, at least at a functional level of description, much of what a computer is actually used for, and much of what the brain/mind does. When I toss a Frisbee to the neighbor's dog, the dog does not, I think, engage in a symbolic soliloquy about the trajectory of the disc, the wind's effects on it, and formulas for including lift and the acceleration due to gravity. There are symbolic formulas for each of these relations, but the dog insofar as I can tell, does not use any of these formulas. Nevertheless, it computes these factors in order to intercept the disc in the air. I argue that determining the solution to a differential equation is at least as much computation as is processing symbols. The disagreement is over what counts as computation, I think that Harnad and I both agree that the dog solves the trajectory problem implicitly. This definition is important, because, although Harnad offers a technical definition for what he means by computation, the folk- definition of the term is probably interpreted differently, and I believe this leads to trouble Additional links for this entry: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad93.symb.anal.net.roitblat.html Schneider, Susan (2009).

The nature of primitive symbols in the language of thought. Mind and Language . ( Google | More links ) Abstract: This paper provides a theory of the nature of symbols in the language of thought (LOT). My discussion consists in three parts. In part one, I provide three arguments for the individuation of primitive symbols in terms of total computational role. The first of these arguments claims that Classicism requires that primitive symbols be typed in this manner; no other theory of typing will suffice. The second argument contends that without this manner of symbol individuation, there will be computational processes that fail to supervene on syntax, together with the rules of composition and the computational algorithms. The third argument says that cognitive science needs a natural kind that is typed by total computational role. Otherwise, either cognitive science will be incomplete, or its laws will have counterexamples. Then, part two defends this view from a criticism, offered by both Jerry Fodor and Jesse Prinz, who respond to my view with the charge that because the types themselves are individuated Additional links for this entry: http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/SchneiderNatureSymbolsMindLang.doc http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/SchneiderNatureSymbolsMindLang-1-2.pdf http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/Schneider-MindLangSymbols.pdf Sun, Ron (2000). Symbol grounding: A new look at an old idea. Philosophical Psychology 13 (2):149-172. ( Cited by 39 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Symbols should be grounded, as has been argued before. But we insist that they should be grounded not only in subsymbolic activities, but also in the interaction between the agent and the world. The point is that concepts are not formed in isolation (from the world), in abstraction, or "objectively." They are formed in relation to the experience of agents, through their perceptual/motor apparatuses, in their world and linked to their goals and actions. This paper takes a detailed look at this relatively old issue, with a new perspective, aided by our work of computational cognitive model development. To further our understanding, we also go back in time to link up with earlier philosophical theories related to this issue. The result is an account that extends from computational mechanisms to philosophical abstractions Additional links for this entry: http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~rsun/sun.PP00.ps http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/sun99symbol.html http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~content=a713690432~fulltext=713240930 http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/KKLQAQTYVG4RUY7G.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/KKLQAQTYVG4RUY7G.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2000/00000013/00000002/art00001 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a713690432~fulltext=713240930 Taddeo, Mariarosaria Floridi, Luciano (2008). A praxical solution of the symbol grounding problem. Minds and Machines . ( Google | More links ) Abstract: This article is the second step in our research into the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP). In a previous work, we defined the main condition that must be satisfied by any strategy in order to provide a valid solution to the SGP, namely the zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition). We then showed that all the main strategies proposed so far fail to satisfy the Z condition, although they provide several important lessons to be followed by any new proposal. Here, we develop a new solution of the SGP. It is called praxical in order to stress the key role played by the interactions between the agents and their environment. It is based on a new theory of meaningâAction-based Semantics (AbS)âand on a new kind of artificial agents, called two-machine artificial agents (AMÂ²). Thanks to their architecture, AM2s implement AbS, and this allows them to ground their symbols semantically and to develop some fairly advanced semantic abilities, including the development of semantically grounded communication and the elaboration of representations, while still respecting the Z condition Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/f748ru5636784058/fulltext.pdf Thompson, Evan (1997). Symbol grounding: A bridge from artiï¬cial life to artiï¬cial intelligence. Brain and Cognition 34 (1):48-71. (Cited by 8 | Google | More links ) Abstract: This paper develops a bridge from AL issues about the symbolâmatter relation to AI issues about symbol-grounding by focusing on the concepts of formality and syntactic interpretability. Using the DNA triplet-amino acid speciï¬cation relation as a paradigm, it is argued that syntactic properties can be grounded as high-level features of the non-syntactic interactions in a physical dynamical system. This argu- ment provides the basis for a rebuttal of John Searleâs recent assertion that syntax is observer-relative (1990, 1992). But the argument as developed also challenges the classic symbol-processing theory of mind against which Searle is arguing, as well as the strong AL thesis that life is realizable in a purely computational medium. Finally, it provides a new line of support for the autonomous systems approach in AL and AI (Varela & Bourgine 1992a, 1992b).

( Google ) Abstract: In this paper I introduce a formalism for natural language understandingbased on a computational implementation of Discourse RepresentationTheory. The formalism covers a wide variety of semantic phenomena(including scope and lexical ambiguities, anaphora and presupposition),is computationally attractive, and has a genuine inference component. Itcombines a well-established linguistic formalism (DRT) with advancedtechniques to deal with ambiguity (underspecification), and isinnovative in the use of first-order theorem proving techniques.The architecture of the formalism for natural language understandingthat I advocate consists of three levels of processing:underspecification, resolution, andinference. Each of these levels has a distinct function andtherefore employs a different kind of semantic representation. Themappings between these different representations define the interfacesbetween the levels Charniak, Eugene Wilks, Yorick (eds.) (1976).

Moreover, we give some direct empirical evidence linking computational complexity predictions with cognitive reality. In the empirical study we compare time needed for understanding different types of quantifiers.

It can be explained to any school-child (as Newtonian mechanics and Einsteinian relativity cannot) that living creatures are just Darwinian survival/reproduction machines. They have whatever structure they have through a combination of chance and its consequences: Chance causes changes in the genetic blueprint from which organisms' bodies are built, and if those changes are more successful in helping their owners survive and reproduce than their predecessors or their rivals, then, by definition, those changes are reproduced, and thereby become more prevalent in succeeding generations: Whatever survives/reproduces better survives/reproduces better. That is the tautological force that shaped us Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/3016/01/darwin.htm http://eprints.resist.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7715/ http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7715/01/darwin.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003016/ http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/darwin.htm http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7715/01/darwin.htm http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/darwin.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003016/ http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:3016 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:3016 http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk:7715 Johnson-Laird, Philip N.

The cultural origins of cognitive adaptations. Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement . ( Google | More links ) Abstract: According to an influential view in contemporary cognitive science, many human cognitive capacities are innate. The primary support for this view comes from âpoverty of stimulusâ arguments. In general outline, such arguments contrast the meagre informational input to cognitive development with its rich informational output. Consider the ease with which humans acquire languages, become facile at attributing psychological states (âfolk psychologyâ), gain knowledge of biological kinds (âfolk biologyâ), or come to understand basic physical processes (âfolk physicsâ). In all these cases, the evidence available to a growing child is far too thin and noisy for it to be plausible that the underlying principles involved are derived from general learning mechanisms. This only alternative hypothesis seems to be that the childâs grasp of these principles is innate. (Cf. Laurence and Margolis, 2001.)

Aydede (eds.), Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition . Cambridge University Press. ( Google ) Abstract: The situated cognition movement has emerged in recent decades (although it has roots in psychologists working earlier in the 20 th century including Vygotsky, Bartlett, and Dewey) largely in reaction to an approach to explaining cognition that tended to ignore the context in which cognitive activities typically occur. Fodorâs (1980) account of the research strategy of methodological solipsism, according to which only representational states within the mind are viewed as playing causal roles in producing cognitive activity, is an extreme characterization of this approach. (As Keith Gunderson memorably commented when Fodor first presented this characterization, it amounts to reversing behaviorism by construing the mind as a white box in a black world). Critics as far back as the 1970s and 1980s objected to many experimental paradigms in cognitive psychology as not being ecologically valid; that is, they maintained that the findings only applied to the artificial circumstances created in the laboratory and did not generalize to real world settings (Neisser, 1976; 1987). The situated cognition movement, however, goes much further than demanding ecologically valid experimentsâit insists that an agentâs cognitive activities are inherently embedded and supported by dynamic interactions with the agentâs body and features of its environment Clark, Andy (1991).

Familiar reactions on first encounters range from revulsion to condescending dismissal--very few faces in the crowd light up with the sense of "Aha! So that's how the mind works! Of course!" Cognitive science leaves something out, it seems; moreover, what it apparently leaves out is important, even precious. Boiled down to its essence, cognitive science proclaims that in one way or another our minds are computers, and this seems so mechanistic, reductionistic, intellectualistic, dry, philistine, unbiological. It leaves out emotion, or what philosophers call qualia, or value, or mattering, or . . . the soul. It doesn't explain what minds are so much as attempt to explain minds away Additional links for this entry: http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/varela.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000273/ http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:273 Fulda, Joseph S.

(1993). Connectionism, explicit rules, and symbolic manipulation. Minds and Machines 3 (2):183-200. ( Cited by 13 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â At present, the prevailing Connectionist methodology forrepresenting rules is toimplicitly embody rules in neurally-wired networks. That is, the methodology adopts the stance that rules must either be hard-wired or trained into neural structures, rather than represented via explicit symbolic structures. Even recent attempts to implementproduction systems within connectionist networks have assumed that condition-action rules (or rule schema) are to be embodied in thestructure of individual networks. Such networks must be grown or trained over a significant span of time. However, arguments are presented herein that humanssometimes follow rules which arevery rapidly assignedexplicit internal representations, and that humans possessgeneral mechanisms capable of interpreting and following such rules. In particular, arguments are presented that thespeed with which humans are able to follow rules ofnovel structure demonstrates the existence of general-purpose rule following mechanisms. It is further argued that the existence of general-purpose rule following mechanisms strongly indicates that explicit rule following is not anisolated phenomenon, but may well be a common and important aspect of cognition. The relationship of the foregoing conclusions to Smolensky''s view of explicit rule following is also explored. The arguments presented here are pragmatic in nature, and are contrasted with thekind of arguments developed by Fodor and Pylyshyn in their recent, influential paper Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/P6445N4854J7T407.pdf Hadley, Robert F.

( Cited by 25 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Much of traditional AI exemplifies the explicit representation paradigm, and during the late 1980''s a heated debate arose between the classical and connectionist camps as to whether beliefs and rules receive an explicit or implicit representation in human cognition. In a recent paper, Kirsh (1990) questions the coherence of the fundamental distinction underlying this debate. He argues that our basic intuitions concerning explicit and implicit representations are not only confused but inconsistent. Ultimately, Kirsh proposes a new formulation of the distinction, based upon the criterion ofconstant time processing.The present paper examines Kirsh''s claims. It is argued that Kirsh fails to demonstrate that our usage of explicit and implicit is seriously confused or inconsistent. Furthermore, it is argued that Kirsh''s new formulation of the explicit-implicit distinction is excessively stringent, in that it banishes virtually all sentences of natural language from the realm of explicit representation. By contrast, the present paper proposes definitions for explicit and implicit which preserve most of our strong intuitions concerning straightforward uses of these terms. It is also argued that the distinction delineated here sustains the meaningfulness of the abovementioned debate between classicists and connectionists Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/kl736k107182317h/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/kl736k107182317h/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/KL736K107182317H.pdf Kirsh, David (1990).

In this paper, we offer an intermediate view that retains intuitions from both of them. We establish three conditions for explicit information that preserve a structural requirement, and a notion of explicitness as a continuous dimension. A problem with the former accounts was their disconnection with psychological work on the issue. We review studies by Karmiloff-Smith, and Shanks and St. John to show that the proposed conditions have psychological grounds.

(ms). The embodied cognition research program. ( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Unifying traditional cognitive science is the idea that thinking is a process of symbol manipulation, where symbols lead both a syntactic and a semantic life. The syntax of a symbol comprises those properties in virtue of which the symbol undergoes rule-dictated transformations. The semantics of a symbol constitute the symbolsÃ meaning or representational content. Thought consists in the syntactically determined manipulation of symbols, but in a way that respects their semantics. Thus, for instance, a calculating computer sensitive only to the shape of symbols might produce the symbol Ã5Ã in response to the inputs Ã2Ã, Ã+Ã, and Ã3Ã. As far as the computer is concerned, these symbols have no meaning, but because of its program it will produce outputs that, to the user, Ãmake senseÃ given the meanings the user attributes to the symbols Additional links for this entry: http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/HomePage/PhilComp.htm http://philosophy.wisc.edu/shapiro/HomePage/embodiedcognition.pdf Skokowski, Paul G.

Abstract: Â Â I examine whether it is possible for content relevant to a computer''s behavior to be carried without an explicit internal representation. I consider three approaches. First, an example of a chess playing computer carrying emergent content is offered from Dennett. Next I examine Cummins response to this example. Cummins says Dennett''s computer executes a rule which is inexplicitly represented. Cummins describes a process wherein a computer interprets explicit rules in its program, implements them to form a chess-playing device, then this device executes the rules in a way that exhibits them inexplicitly. Though this approach is intriguing, I argue that the chess-playing device cannot exist as imagined. The processes of interpretation and implementation produce explicit representations of the content claimed to be inexplicit. Finally, the Chinese Room argument is examined and shown not to save the notion of inexplicit information. This means the strategy of attributing inexplicit content to a computer which is executing a rule, fails Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=0148099CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/j821320368ht5863/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/J821320368HT5863.pdf Slezak, Peter (1999).

In their defence of the orthodox symbolic representational theory, A. Vera and H. Simon (1993) have rebutted many of these claims, but they overlook an important reading of situated arguments which may, after all, involve a revolutionary insight.

As well as the direct, first?person knowledge of self to which we are led in the Meditationes , we can also seek knowledge of our own bodies, and of the union of our minds and our bodies: the latter forms of self?knowledge are inevitably imperfect, but are no less important in guiding our conduct in the search after truth van Gelder, Tim (1998).

Paul Churchland used the term to describe âour commonsense conception of psychological phenomenaâ (Churchland 1981, p. 67), whatever that may be. When we ask the question whether animals have their own folk psychology, weâre asking whether any other species has a commonsense conception of psychological phenomenon as well. Different versions of this question have been discussed over the past 25 years, but no clear answer has emerged. Perhaps one reason for this lack of progress is that we donât clearly understand the question. In asking whether animals have folk psychology, I hope to help clarify the concept of folk psychology itself, and in the process, to gain a greater understanding of the role of belief and desire attribution in human social interaction Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/w2506611815711g1.pdf Bechtel, William P.

Use embodied, complete systems, starting simple and working incrementally. Abstract: Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporateeverything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments Additional links for this entry: http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/representation.pdf http://people.csail.mit.edu/~brooks/papers/representation.pdf http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/brooks/papers/representation.pdf http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/Courses/cs673/spring00/brooks2.pdf http://www.valentiniweb.com/Piermo/robotica/doc/Brooks/representation.pdf http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~aferworn/courses/CPS607/CLASSES/subsumption.pdf http://hugo.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yjhsu/courses/u1760/Online/papers/brooks2.pdf http://agents.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yjhsu/courses/u1760/Online/papers/brooks2.pdf http://www.ee.pdx.edu/~mperkows/ML_LAB/Giant_Hexapod/brooks.representation.pdf http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~alvares/CMP124SMA/IntelligenceWithoutRepresentation.pdf http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004spring/mas966/Brooks Int wo rep (orig version).pdf http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=2506361CI http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/~douglass/Douglass/Agents/TopicPapers/~TopCandidates~/Robotics/brooks87intelligence.pdf http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=605f19sD3y7t4DoispNMxvmyy3Y http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=DAI5FtzBm8byWUcnf5U3qBR0ihk http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=HHybOULxfTdFwfwaliV_tWAF-rY http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=qiqJVUCetwl0cyAg5v_FQkGQePw http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=CcPsaAISyDSP5mOKB52AxYOWprI http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=kaOJuTY3bDJqBoxZyS0StZghsM4 http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=ZOLRXpLrB5DFvnDlSf6wNaw3gYg http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=wE7wq6m3Inq7Z4qwmXLucc7RI00 http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=LYLowQNnoYxvhtwzFNt0X9gEQ4Y http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=eFSDUHWbsnHEh9S4Zn_paKguMWc http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=lN7SP76JP7P7VOlJEKQ4NEl3MkU http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=WBYA3src9nEuAgdYTkk4CjPHrqQ http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=gzFoWrIH5zSH1JxwjugtFKvBPxs Clark, Andy Toribio, Josefa (1994). Doing without representing. Synthese 101 (3):401-31. ( Cited by 97 | Annotation | Google | More links ) A discussion of anti-representationalism in situated robotics and the dynamic systems movement (Brooks, Beer, van Gelder). These arguments appeal to overly simple domains, and a modest notion of representation survives. Abstract: Â Â Connectionism and classicism, it generally appears, have at least this much in common: both place some notion of internal representation at the heart of a scientific study of mind. In recent years, however, a much more radical view has gained increasing popularity. This view calls into question the commitment to internal representation itself. More strikingly still, this new wave of anti-representationalism is rooted not in armchair theorizing but in practical attempts to model and understand intelligent, adaptive behavior. In this paper we first present, and then critically assess, a variety of recent anti-representationalist treatments. We suggest that so far, at least, the sceptical rhetoric outpaces both evidence and argument. Some probable causes of this premature scepticism are isolated. Nonetheless, the anti-representationalist challenge is shown to be both important and progressive insofar as it forces us to see beyond the bare representational/non-representational dichotomy and to recognize instead a rich continuum of degrees and types of representationality Additional links for this entry: http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/clark (1994) doing without representing.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/w02t5nm8j7164v10/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/W02T5NM8J7164V10.pdf Dennett, Daniel C.

(Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: On Reading Signs; Some Differences between Us and The Others If there are certain kinds of signs that an animal cannot learn to interpret, that might be for any of a number of reasons. It might be, first, because the animal cannot discriminate the signs from one another. For example, although human babies learn to discriminate human speech sounds according to the phonological structures of their native languages very easily, it may be that few if any other animals are capable of fully grasping the phonological structures of human languages. If an animal cannot learn to interpret certain signs it might be, second, because the decoding is too difficult for it. It could be, for example, that some animals are incapable of decoding signs that exhibit syntactic embedding, or signs that are spread out over time as opposed to over space. Problems of these various kinds might be solved by using another sign system, say, gestures rather than noises, or visual icons laid out in spatial order, or by separating out embedded propositions and presenting each separately. But a more interesting reason that an animal might be incapable of understanding a sign would be that it lacked mental representations of the necessary kind. It might be incapable of representing mentally what the sign conveys.

(1998). Doing without representations which specify what to do. Philosophical Psychology 11 (3):269-302. ( Cited by 15 | Google ) Abstract: A discussion is going on in cognitive science about the use of representations to explain how intelligent behavior is generated. In the traditional view, an organism is thought to incorporate representations. These provide an internal model that is used by the organism to instruct the motor apparatus so that the adaptive and anticipatory characteristics of behavior come about. So-called interactionists claim that this representational specification of behavior raises more problems than it solves. In their view, the notion of internal representational models is to be dispensed with. Instead, behavior is to be explained as the intricate interaction between an embodied organism and the specific make up of an environment. The problem with a non-representational interactive account is that it has severe difficulties with anticipatory, future oriented behavior. The present paper extends the interactionist conceptual framework by drawing on ideas derived from the study of morphogenesis. This extended interactionist framework is based on an analysis of anticipatory behavior as a process which involves multiple spatio-temporal scales of neural, bodily and environmental dynamics. This extended conceptual framework provides the outlines for an explanation of anticipatory behavior without involving a representational specification of future goal states Kirsh, David (1991).

By tuning the perceptual system to task relevant properties a creature can cope with relatively sophisticated environments without concepts. There is a limit, however, to how far a creature without concepts can go. Rod Brooks, like many ecologically oriented scientists, argues that the vast majority of intelligent behaviour is concept-free. To evaluate this position I consider what special benefits accrue to concept-using creatures. Concepts are either necessary for certain types of perception, learning, and control, or they make those processes computationally simpler. Once a creature has concepts its capacities are vastly multiplied. Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=2506371CI MÃ¼ller, Vincent C. (2007). Is there a future for AI without representation? Minds and Machines 17 (1). ( Google | More links ) Abstract: This paper investigates the prospects of Rodney Brooksâ proposal for AI without representation. It turns out that the supposedly characteristic features of ânew AIâ (embodiment, situatedness, absence of reasoning, and absence of representation) are all present in conventional systems: âNew AIâ is just like old AI. Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agentsâWhich, however, turns out to be crucial. Some of more recent cognitive science suggests that we might do well to dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors. If this paradigm shift is achieved, Brooksâ proposal for cognition without representation appears promising for full-blown intelligent agentsâThough not for conscious agents Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1285561.1285568 http://www.springerlink.com/index/T65JK1H2705383L8.pdf http://www.typos.de/pdf/2007_AI_without_representation_M http://www.springerlink.com/content/t65jk1h2705383l8/fulltext.pdf van Gelder, Tim (1995).

Intention without representation. Philosophical Psychology 17 (2):209-223. ( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: A mechanism for planning ahead would appear to be essential to any creature with more than insect level intelligence. In this paper it is shown how planning, using full means-ends analysis, can be had while avoiding the so called symbol grounding problem. The key role of knowledge representation in intelligence has been acknowledged since at least the enlightenment, but the advent of the computer has made it possible to explore the limits of alternate schemes, and to explore the nature of our everyday understanding of the world around us. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics has forced a close examination, by people other than philosophers, of what it means to say for instance that "snow is white." One interpretation of the "new AI" is that it is questioning the need for representation altogether. Brooks and others have shown how a range of intelligent behaviors can be had without representation, and this paper goes one step further showing how intending to do things can be achieved without symbolic representation. The paper gives a concrete example of a mechanism in terms of robots that play soccer. It describes a belief, desire and intention (BDI) architecture that plans in terms of activities. The result is a situated agent that plans to do things with no more ontological commitment than the reactive systems Brooks described in his seminal paper, "Intelligence without Representation."

High-level perception, representation, and analogy:A critique of artificial intelligence methodology. Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intellige 4 (3):185 - 211. ( Cited by 123 | Google | More links ) Abstract: High-level perception--âthe process of making sense of complex data at an abstract, conceptual level--âis fundamental to human cognition. Through high-level perception, chaotic environmen- tal stimuli are organized into the mental representations that are used throughout cognitive pro- cessing. Much work in traditional artificial intelligence has ignored the process of high-level perception, by starting with hand-coded representations. In this paper, we argue that this dis- missal of perceptual processes leads to distorted models of human cognition. We examine some existing artificial-intelligence models--ânotably BACON, a model of scientific discovery, and the Structure-Mapping Engine, a model of analogical thought--âand argue that these are flawed pre- cisely because they downplay the role of high-level perception. Further, we argue that perceptu- al processes cannot be separated from other cognitive processes even in principle, and therefore that traditional artificial-intelligence models cannot be defended by supposing the existence of a --Årepresentation module--ï¿½ that supplies representations ready-made. Finally, we describe a model of high-level perception and analogical thought in which perceptual processing is integrated with analogical mapping, leading to the flexible build-up of representations appropriate to a given context Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/49715.html http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=175346.175347 http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/highlevel.pdf http://www.nbu.bg/cogs/personal/kokinov/COG501/hightlevel.pdf http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=2767459CI http://www.informaworld.com/index/778787585.pdf Dartnall, Terry (2000). Reverse psychologism, cognition and content. Minds and Machines 10 (1):31-52. ( Cited by 32 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The confusion between cognitive states and the content of cognitive states that gives rise to psychologism also gives rise to reverse psychologism. Weak reverse psychologism says that we can study cognitive states by studying content â for instance, that we can study the mind by studying linguistics or logic. This attitude is endemic in cognitive science and linguistic theory. Strong reverse psychologism says that we can generate cognitive states by giving computers representations that express the content of cognitive states and that play a role in causing appropriate behaviour. This gives us strong representational, classical AI (REPSCAI), and I argue that it cannot succeed. This is not, as Searle claims in his Chinese Room Argument, because syntactic manipulation cannot generate content. Syntactic manipulation can generate content, and this is abundantly clear in the Chinese Room scenano. REPSCAI cannot succeed because inner content is not sufficient for cognition, even when the representations that carry the content play a role in generating appropriate behaviour Additional links for this entry: http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/handle/10072/3245 http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=475243CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/r64783586474k030/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/r64783586474k030/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=231754=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/R64783586474K030.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2000/00000010/00000001/00231754 Dietrich, Eric (1988).

( Google ) Abstract: John Searle believes that computational properties are purely formal and that consequently, computational properties are not intrinsic, empirically discoverable, nor causal; and therefore, that an entityâs having certain computational properties could not be sufficient for its having certain mental properties. To make his case, Searleâs employs an argument that had been used before him by Max Newman, against Russellâs structuralism; one that Russell himself considered fatal to his own position. This paper formulates a not-so-explored version of Searleâs problem with computational cognitive science, and refutes it by suggesting how our understanding of computation is far from implying the structuralism Searle vitally attributes to it. On the way, I formulate and argue for a thesis that strengthens Newmanâs case against Russellâs structuralism, and thus raises the apparent risk for computational cognitive science too Fields, Christopher A.

Work on topics like prior probabilities, the theory-ladenness of observation, encyclopedic knowledge for disambiguation in language translation and pathology test diagnosis has produced a body of knowledge on how to represent context in artiï¬cial intelligence applications Fulda, Joseph S.

Minds and Machines . ( Google ) Abstract: According to Ramsey (Representation reconsidered, Cambridge University Press, New York, 2007), only classical cognitive science, with the related notions of inputâoutput and structural representations, meets the job description challenge (the challenge to show that a certain structure or process serves a representational role at the subpersonal level). By contrast, connectionism and other nonclassical models, insofar as they exploit receptor and tacit notions of representation, are not genuinely representational. As a result, Ramsey submits, cognitive science is taking a U-turn from representationalism back to behaviourism, thus presupposing that (1) the emergence of cognitivism capitalized on the concept of representation, and that (2) the materialization of nonclassical cognitive science involves a return to some form of pre-cognitivist behaviourism. We argue against both (1) and (2), by questioning Ramseyâs divide between classical and representational, versus nonclassical and nonrepresentational, cognitive models. For, firstly, connectionist and other nonclassical accounts have the resources to exploit the notion of a structural isomorphism, like classical accounts (the beefing-up strategy); and, secondly, insofar as inputâoutput and structural representations refer to a cognitive agent, classical explanations fail to meet the job description challenge (the deflationary strategy). Both strategies work independently of each other: if the deflationary strategy succeeds, contra (1), cognitivism has failed to capitalize on the relevant concept of representation; if the beefing-up strategy is sound, contra (2), the return to a pre-cognitivist era cancels out.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In this paper we attempt to develop a problem representation technique which enables the decomposition of a problem into subproblems such that their solution in sequence constitutes a strategy for solving the problem. An important issue here is that the subproblems generated should be easier than the main problem. We propose to represent a set of problem states by a statement which is true for all the members of the set. A statement itself is just a set of atomic statements which are binary predicates on state variables. Then, the statement representing the set of goal states can be partitioned into its subsets each of which becomes a subgoal of the resulting strategy. The techniques involved in partitioning a goal into its subgoals are presented with examples Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/9522322854447002.pdf Haugeland, John (1981).

( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Searleâs celebrated Chinese room thought experiment was devised as an attempted refutation of the view that appropriately programmed digital computers literally are the possessors of genuine mental states. A standard reply to Searle, known as the ârobot replyâ (which, I argue, reflects the dominant approach to the problem of content in contemporary philosophy of mind), consists of the claim that the problem he raises can be solved by supplementing the computational device with some âappropriateâ environmental hookups. I argue that not only does Searle himself casts doubt on the adequacy of this idea by applying to it a slightly revised version of his original argument, but that the weakness of this encoding-based approach to the problem of intentionality can also be exposed from a somewhat different angle. Capitalizing on the work of several authors and, in particular, on that of psychologist Mark Bickhard, I argue that the existence of symbol-world correspondence is not a property that the cognitive system itself can appreciate, from its own perspective, by interacting with the symbol and therefore, not a property that can constitute intrinsic content. The foundational crisis to which Searle alluded is, I conclude, very much alive Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/k26t830883g84041/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/K26T830883G84041.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2005/00000015/00000002/00002004 Stanley, Jason (2005). Review of Robyn Carston, Thoughts and Utterances . Mind and Language 20 (3). ( Google ) Abstract: Relevance Theory is the influential theory of linguistic interpretation first championed by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson. Relevance theorists have made important contributions to our understanding of a wide range of constructions, especially constructions that tend to receive less attention in semantics and philosophy of language. But advocates of Relevance Theory also have had a tendency to form a rather closed community, with an unwillingness to translate their own special vocabulary and distinctions into more neutral vernacular. Since Robyn Carston has long been the advocate of Relevance Theory most able to communicate with a broader philosophical and linguistic audience, it is with particular interest that the emergence of her long-awaited volume, Thoughts and Utterances has been greeted. The volume exhibits many of the strengths, but also some of the weaknesses, of this well-known program Thornton, Chris (1997).

The main value of the model is that it provides an illustration of how simple learning processes may lead to the formation of structures which can be given a representational interpretation.

Connectionism and classicism may be compatible even without implementation, in any case. Abstract: Â Â Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) have argued that the cognitive architecture is not Connectionist. Their argument takes the following form: (1) the cognitive architecture is Classical; (2) Classicalism and Connectionism are incompatible; (3) therefore the cognitive architecture is not Connectionist. In this essay I argue that Fodor and Pylyshyn's defenses of (1) and (2) are inadequate. Their argument for (1), based on their claim that Classicalism best explains the systematicity of cognitive capacities, is an invalid instance of inference to the best explanation. And their argument for (2) turns out to be question-begging. The upshot is that, while Fodor and Pylyshyn have presented Connectionists with the important empirical challenge of explaining systematicity, they have failed to provide sufficient reason for inferring that the cognitive architecture is Classical and not Connectionist Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/u316462310k73495/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/U316462310K73495.pdf Aydede, Murat (1997). Language of thought: The connectionist contribution. Minds and Machines 7 (1):57-101. ( Cited by 15 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Fodor and Pylyshyn's critique of connectionism has posed a challenge to connectionists: Adequately explain such nomological regularities as systematicity and productivity without postulating a "language of thought" (LOT). Some connectionists like Smolensky took the challenge very seriously, and attempted to meet it by developing models that were supposed to be non-classical. At the core of these attempts lies the claim that connectionist models can provide a representational system with a combinatorial syntax and processes sensitive to syntactic structure. They are not implementation models because, it is claimed, the way they obtain syntax and structure sensitivity is not "concatenative," hence "radically different" from the way classicists handle them. In this paper, I offer an analysis of what it is to physically satisfy/realize a formal system. In this context, I examine the minimal truth-conditions of LOT Hypothesis. From my analysis it will follow that concatenative realization of formal systems is irrelevant to LOTH since the very notion of LOT is indifferent to such an implementation level issue as concatenation. I will conclude that to the extent to which they can explain the law-like cognitive regularities, a certain class of connectionist models proposed as radical alternatives to the classical LOT paradigm will in fact turn out to be LOT models, even though new and potentially very exciting ones Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/v8365g5vp26x7x75/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/v8365g5vp26x7x75/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=115552=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/V8365G5VP26X7X75.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000001/00115552 Butler, Keith (1993).

( Cited by 6 | Annotation | Google ) Contra Chalmers 1993, F's argument doesn't apply at the implementational level. Contra Chater and Oaksford 1990, connectionism can't be purely implementational, but some implementational details can be relevant. Abstract: This paper discusses the relation between cognitive and implementational levels of analysis. Chalmers (1990, 1993) argues that a connectionist implementation of a classical cognitive architecture possesses a compositional semantics, and therefore undercuts Fodor and Pylyshyn's (1988) argument that connectionist networks cannot possess a compositional semantics. I argue that Chalmers argument misconstrues the relation between cognitive and implementational levels of analysis. This paper clarifies the distinction, and shows that while Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument survives Chalmers' critique, it cannot be used to establish the irrelevance of neurophysiological implementation to cognitive modeling; some aspects of Chater and Oaksford's (1990) response to Fodor and Pylyshyn, though not all, are therefore cogent Butler, Keith (1995).

With some empirical results on structure sensitive processing, and some remarks on explanation. Abstract: This paper offers both a theoretical and an experimental perspective on the relationship between connectionist and Classical (symbol-processing) models. Firstly, a serious flaw in Fodor and Pylyshynâs argument against connectionism is pointed out: if, in fact, a part of their argument is valid, then it establishes a conclusion quite different from that which they intend, a conclusion which is demonstrably false. The source of this flaw is traced to an underestimation of the differences between localist and distributed representation. It has been claimed that distributed representations cannot support systematic operations, or that if they can, then they will be mere implementations of traditional ideas. This paper presents experimental evidence against this conclusion: distributed representations can be used to support direct structure-sensitive operations, in a man- ner quite unlike the Classical approach. Finally, it is argued that even if Fodor and Pylyshynâs argument that connectionist models of compositionality must be mere implementations were correct, then this would still not be a serious argument against connectionism as a theory of mind Chalmers, David J.

I also think that if we look at representational spaces in the right way, we can see that they are deeply related to classical phenomenon of systematicity in representation. I want to argue that the key to understanding representational spaces, and in particular their ability to capture the deep organization underlying various problems, lies in the idea of what I will call Additional links for this entry: http://consc.net/notes/clark-comments.html Chalmers, David J. (1990). Syntactic transformations on distributed representations. Connection Science 2:53-62. ( Cited by 180 | Annotation | Google | More links ) An experimental demonstration that connectionist models can handle structure-sensitive operations in a non-classical way, transforming structured representations of active sentences to passive sentences. Abstract: There has been much interest in the possibility of connectionist models whose representations can be endowed with compositional structure, and a variety of such models have been proposed. These models typically use distributed representations that arise from the functional composition of constituent parts. Functional composition and decomposition alone, however, yield only an implementation of classical symbolic theories. This paper explores the possibility of moving beyond implementation by exploiting holistic structure-sensitive operations on distributed representations. An experiment is performed using Pollackâs Recursive Auto-Associative Memory. RAAM is used to construct distributed representations of syntactically structured sentences. A feed-forward network is then trained to operate directly on these representations, modeling syn- tactic transformations of the represented sentences. Successful training and generalization is obtained, demonstrating that the implicit structure present in these representations can be used for a kind of structure-sensitive processing unique to the connectionist domain Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/517265.html http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chalmers90syntactic.html http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/transformations.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/776705615.pdf Christiansen, M.

Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the âsystematicityâ of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or âabstract neurologicalâ) structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented.

Mentalese not spoken here: Computation, cognition, and causation. Philosophical Psychology 10 (4):413-35. ( Cited by 38 | Google ) Abstract: Classical computational modellers of mind urge that the mind is something like a von Neumann computer operating over a system of symbols constituting a language of thought. Such an architecture, they argue, presents us with the best explanation of the compositionality, systematicity and productivity of thought. The language of thought hypothesis is supported by additional independent arguments made popular by Jerry Fodor. Paul Smolensky has developed a connectionist architecture he claims adequately explains compositionality, systematicity and productivity without positing any language of thought, and without positing any operations over a set of symbols. This architecture encodes the information represented in linguistic trees without explicitly representing those trees or their constituents, and indeed without employing any representational vehicles with constituent structure. In a recent article, Fodor (1997; Connectionism and systematicity, Cognition , 62, 109-119) argues that Smolensky's proposal does not work. I defend Smolensky against Fodor's attack, and use this interchange as a vehicle for exploring and criticising the âLanguage of Thoughtâ hypothesis more generally and the arguments Fodor adduces on its behalf Garcia-Carpintero, Manuel (1996). Two spurious varieties of compositionality. Minds and Machines 6 (2):159-72. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The paper examines an alleged distinction claimed to exist by Van Gelder between two different, but equally acceptable ways of accounting for the systematicity of cognitive output (two varieties of compositionality): concatenative compositionality vs. functional compositionality. The second is supposed to provide an explanation alternative to the Language of Thought Hypothesis. I contend that, if the definition of concatenative compositionality is taken in a different way from the official one given by Van Gelder (but one suggested by some of his formulations) then there is indeed a different sort of compositionality; however, the second variety is not an alternative to the language of thought in that case. On the other hand, if the concept of concatenative compositionality is taken in a different way, along the lines of Van Gelder's explicit definition, then there is no reason to think that there is an alternative way of explaining systematicity Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/j74132418g368g21/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/J74132418G368G21.pdf Guarini, Marcello (1996).

( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In his discussion of results which I (with Michael Hayward) recently reported in this journal, Kenneth Aizawa takes issue with two of our conclusions, which are: (a) that our connectionist model provides a basis for explaining systematicity within the realm of sentence comprehension, and subject to a limited range of syntax (b) that the model does not employ structure-sensitive processing, and that this is clearly true in the early stages of the network''s training. Ultimately, Aizawa rejects both (a) and (b) for reasons which I think are ill-founded. In what follows, I offer a defense of our position. In particular, I argue (1) that Aizawa adopts a standard of explanation that many accepted scientific explanations could not meet, and (2) that Aizawa misconstrues the relevant meaning of structure-sensitive process Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=316242CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/m395128140134l86/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=122810=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/M395128140134L86.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000004/00122810 Hadley, Robert F.

Strong semantic systematicity from Hebbian connectionist learning. Minds and Machines 7 (1):1-55. ( Cited by 46 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Fodor's and Pylyshyn's stand on systematicity in thought and language has been debated and criticized. Van Gelder and Niklasson, among others, have argued that Fodor and Pylyshyn offer no precise definition of systematicity. However, our concern here is with a learning based formulation of that concept. In particular, Hadley has proposed that a network exhibits strong semantic systematicity when, as a result of training, it can assign appropriate meaning representations to novel sentences (both simple and embedded) which contain words in syntactic positions they did not occupy during training. The experience of researchers indicates that strong systematicity in any form is difficult to achieve in connectionist systems.Herein we describe a network which displays strong semantic systematicity in response to Hebbian, connectionist training. During training, two-thirds of all nouns are presented only in a single syntactic position (either as grammatical subject or object). Yet, during testing, the network correctly interprets thousands of sentences containing those nouns in novel positions. In addition, the network generalizes to novel levels of embedding. Successful training requires a, corpus of about 1000 sentences, and network training is quite rapid. The architecture and learning algorithms are purely connectionist, but classical insights are discernible in one respect, viz, that complex semantic representations spatially contain their semantic constituents. However, in other important respects, the architecture is distinctly non-classical Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596704.596727 http://www.springerlink.com/content/k4l352163l5777l2/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/K4L352163L5777L2.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000001/00112501 Haselager, W.

( Cited by 11 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â This paper investigates connectionism's potential to solve the frame problem. The frame problem arises in the context of modelling the human ability to see the relevant consequences of events in a situation. It has been claimed to be unsolvable for classical cognitive science, but easily manageable for connectionism. We will focus on a representational approach to the frame problem which advocates the use of intrinsic representations. We argue that although connectionism's distributed representations may look promising from this perspective, doubts can be raised about the potential of distributed representations to allow large amounts of complexly structured information to be adequately encoded and processed. It is questionable whether connectionist models that are claimed to effectively represent structured information can be scaled up to a realistic extent. We conclude that the frame problem provides a difficulty to connectionism that is no less serious than the obstacle it constitutes for classical cognitive science Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=371129CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/um0x474450532866/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=150466=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/UM0X474450532866.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1998/00000008/00000002/00150466 Hawthorne, John (1989). On the compatibility of connectionist and classical models. Philosophical Psychology 2 (1):5-16. ( Cited by 9 | Annotation | Google ) Localist connectionist models may not be able to handle structured presentation, but appropriate distributed models can. Abstract: This paper presents considerations in favour of the view that traditional (classical) architectures can be seen as emergent features of connectionist networks with distributed representation. A recent paper by William Bechtel (1988) which argues for a similar conclusion is unsatisfactory in that it fails to consider whether the compositional syntax and semantics attributed to mental representations by classical models can emerge within a connectionist network. The compatibility of the two paradigms hinges largely, I suggest, on how this question is answered. Focusing on the issue of syntax, I argue that while such structure is lacking in connectionist models with local representation, it can be accommodated within networks where representation is distributed. I discuss an important paper by Smolenski (1988) which attempts to show how connectionists can incorporate the relevant syntactic structure, suggesting that some criticisms levelled against that paper by Fodor & Pylyshyn (1988) are wanting. I then go on to indicate a strategy by which a compositional syntax and semantics can be defined for the sort of network that Smolenski describes. I conclude that since the connectionist can respect the central tenets of classicism, the two approaches are compatible with one another Horgan, Terence E. Tienson, John L. (1991).

Abstract: Â Â Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988), Fodor and McLaughlin (1990) and McLaughlin (1993) challenge connectionists to explain systematicity without simply implementing a classical architecture. In this paper I argue that what makes the challenge difficult for connectionists to meet has less to do with what is to be explained than with what is to count as an explanation. Fodor et al. are prepared to admit as explanatory, accounts of a sort that only classical models can provide. If connectionists are to meet the challenge, they are going to have to insist on the propriety of changing what counts as an explanation of systematicity.

( Cited by 42 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In 1988 Fodor and Pylyshyn issued a challenge to the newly-popular connectionism: explain the systematicity of cognition without merely implementing a so-called classical architecture. Since that time quite a number of connectionist models have been put forward, either by their designers or by others, as in some measure demonstrating that the challenge can be met (e.g., Pollack, 1988, 1990; Smolensky, 1990; Chalmers, 1990; Niklasson and Sharkey, 1992; Brousse, 1993). Unfortu- nately, it has generally been unclear whether these models actually do have this implication (see, for instance, the extensive philosophical debate in Smolensky, 1988; Fodor and McLaughlin, 1990; van Gelder, 1990, 1991; McLaughlin, 1993a, 1993b; Clark, 1993). Indeed, we know of no major supporter of classical orthodoxy who has felt compelled, by connectionist models and argu- ments, to concede in print that connectionists have in fact delivered a non-classical explanation of systematicity Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/niklasson94being.html http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0017.1994.tb00227.x Petersen, Steven E.

Recently, Marcus (1998, 1998a, b; Cognition 66, p. 153; Cognitive Psychology 37, p. 243) argued that this capacity, called universal generalization (universality), is not supported by Connectionist models. Instead, universality is best explained by Classical symbol systems, with Connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for Classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative. Consequently, universality is not explained by a Classical theory Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/9lycmrkn91j71qqe/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=408595=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/9LYCMRKN91J71QQE.pdf Plate, Tony A.

Connectionism is a psychotechtonic project, whereas propositional description is a psychosemantic project. Abstract: In an influential critique, Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn point to the existence of a potentially devastating dilemma for connectionism (Fodor and Pylyshyn [1988]). Either connectionist models consist in mere associations of unstructured representations, or they consist in processes involving complex representations. If the former, connectionism is mere associationism, and will not be capable of accounting for very much of cognition. If the latter, then connectionist models concern only the implementation of cognitive processes, and are, therefore, not informative at the level of cognition. I shall argue that Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument is based on a crucial misunderstanding, the same misunderstanding which motivates the entire language of thought hypothesis Additional links for this entry: http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/485 http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/45/2/485 http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/687678.pdf Schroder, Jurgen (1998). Knowledge of rules, causal systematicity, and the language of thought. Synthese 117 (3):313-330. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Martin Davies' criterion for the knowledge of implicit rules, viz. the causal systematicity of cognitive processes, is first exposed. Then the inference from causal systematicity of a process to syntactic properties of the input states is examined. It is argued that Davies' notion of a syntactic property is too weak to bear the conclusion that causal systematicity implies a language of thought as far as the input states are concerned. Next, it is shown that Davies' criterion leads to a counterintuitive consequence: it groups together distributed connectionist systems with look-up tables. To avoid this consequence, a modified construal of causal systematicity is proposed and Davies' argument for the causal systematicity of thought is shown to be question-begging. It is briefly sketched how the modified construal links up with multiple dispositions of the same categorical base. Finally, the question of the causal efficacy of single rules is distinguished from the question of their psychological reality: implicit rules might be psychologically real without being causally efficacious Additional links for this entry: http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=188458=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/W8735T5747313V32.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/synt/1998/00000117/00000003/00188458 Smolensky, Paul (1991).

( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In 1988 Fodor and Pylyshyn issued a challenge to the newly-popular connectionism: explain the systematicity of cognition without merely implementing a so-called classical architecture. Since that time quite a number of connectionist models have been put forward, either by their designers or by others, as in some measure demonstrating that the challenge can be met (e.g., Pollack, 1988, 1990; Smolensky, 1990; Chalmers, 1990; Niklasson and Sharkey, 1992; Brousse, 1993). Unfortu- nately, it has generally been unclear whether these models actually do have this implication (see, for instance, the extensive philosophical debate in Smolensky, 1988; Fodor and McLaughlin, 1990; van Gelder, 1990, 1991; McLaughlin, 1993a, 1993b; Clark, 1993). Indeed, we know of no major supporter of classical orthodoxy who has felt compelled, by connectionist models and argu- ments, to concede in print that connectionists have in fact delivered a non-classical explanation of systematicity Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/niklasson94being.html Waskan, Jonathan A.

(1994). Natural deduction in connectionist systems. Synthese 101 (3):433-463. ( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The relation between logic and thought has long been controversial, but has recently influenced theorizing about the nature of mental processes in cognitive science. One prominent tradition argues that to explain the systematicity of thought we must posit syntactically structured representations inside the cognitive system which can be operated upon by structure sensitive rules similar to those employed in systems of natural deduction. I have argued elsewhere that the systematicity of human thought might better be explained as resulting from the fact that we have learned natural languages which are themselves syntactically structured. According to this view, symbols of natural language are external to the cognitive processing system and what the cognitive system must learn to do is produce and comprehend such symbols. In this paper I pursue that idea by arguing that ability in natural deduction itself may rely on pattern recognition abilities that enable us to operate on external symbols rather than encodings of rules that might be applied to internal representations. To support this suggestion, I present a series of experiments with connectionist networks that have been trained to construct simple natural deductions in sentential logic. These networks not only succeed in reconstructing the derivations on which they have been trained, but in constructing new derivations that are only similar to the ones on which they have been trained Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bechtel94natural.html http://www.blutner.de/NeuralNets/Texts/DERIVATI.pdf http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/~bill/research/DERIVATI.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/q71158t2342jl517/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/Q71158T2342JL517.pdf Butler, Keith (1995).

This promise has met with some resistance from Classical Computionalists, which may have inspired Connectionists to retaliate with bold, inflationary claims on behalf of Connectionist models. This paper demonstrates, by examining three intimately connected issues, that these inflationary claims made on behalf of Connectionism are wrong. This should not be construed as an attack on Connectionism, however, since the inflated claims made on its behalf have the look of cures for which there are no ailments. There is nothing wrong with Connectionism for its failure to solve illusory problems Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/R347125074346147.pdf Calvo GarzÃ³n, Francisco (2000).

Abstract: The character of computational modelling of cognition depends on an underlying theory of representation. Classical cognitive science has exploited the syntax/semantics theory of representation that derives from logic. But this has had the consequence that the kind of psychological explanation supported by classical cognitive science is _conceptualist_: psychological phenomena are modelled in terms of relations that hold between concepts, and between the sensors/effectors and concepts. This kind of explanation is inappropriate for the Proper Treatment of Connectionism (Smolensky 1988) Eliasmith, Chris (online). Structure without symbols: Providing a distributed account of high-level cognition. ( Google ) Abstract: There has been a long-standing debate between symbolicists and connectionists concerning the nature of representation used by human cognizers. In general, symbolicist commitments have allowed them to provide superior models of high-level cognitive function. In contrast, connectionist distributed representations are preferred for providing a description of low-level cognition. The development of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs) has opened the possibility of one representational medium unifying both low-level and high-level descriptions of cognition. This paper describes the relative strengths and weaknesses of symbolic and distributed representations. HRRs are shown to capture the important strengths of both types of representation. These properties of HRRs allow a rebuttal of Fodor and McLaughlin's (1990) criticism that distributed representations are not adequately structure sensitive to provide a full account of human cognition Garzon, Francisco Calvo (2000).

A critique of the similarity space theory of concepts. Mind and Language 22 (4):317345. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: A similarity space is a hyperspace in which the dimensions represent various dimensions on which objects may differ. The similarity space theory of concepts is the thesis that concepts are regions of similarity spaces that are somehow realized in the brain. Proponents of such a theory of concepts include Paul Churchland and Peter GÃ¤rdenfors. This paper argues that the similarity space theory of concepts is mistaken because regions of similarity spaces cannot serve as the components of judgments. It emerges that although similarity spaces cannot model concepts, they may model a kind of nonconceptual representation Additional links for this entry: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/117998149/PDFSTART Goschke, T.

( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The past decade has witnessed the emergence of a novel stance on semantic representation, and its relationship to context sensitivity. Connectionist-minded philosophers, including Clark and van Gelder, have espoused the merits of viewing hidden-layer, context-sensitive representations as possessing semantic content, where this content is partially revealed via the representations'' position in vector space. In recent work, BodÃ©n and Niklasson have incorporated a variant of this view of semantics within their conception of semantic systematicity. Moreover, BodÃ©n and Niklasson contend that they have produced experimental results which not only satisfy a kind of context-based, semantic systematicity, but which, to the degree that reality permits, effectively deals with challenges posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988), and Hadley (1994a). The latter challenge involved well-defined criteria for strong semantic systematicity. This paper examines the relevant claims and experiments of BodÃ©n and Niklasson. It is argued that their case fatally involves two fallacies of equivocation; one concerning ''semantic content'' and the other concerning ''novel test sentences''. In addition, it is argued that their ultimate construal of context sensitive semantics contains serious confusions. These confusions are also found in certain publications dealing with "latent semantic analysis". Thus, criticisms presented here have relevance beyond the work of BodÃ©n and Niklasson Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/p4312417q27100p0/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5142070=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/P4312417Q27100P0.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2004/00000014/00000002/05142070 Haselager, W.

In this paper we propose a procedure for measuring sameness of content of neural representations. We argue that the correct way to compare neural representations is through analysis of the distances between neural activations, and we present a method for doing so. We then use the technique to demonstrate empirically that different artificial neural networks trained by backpropagation on the same categorization task, even with different representational encodings of the input patterns and different numbers of hidden units, reach states in which representations at the hidden units are similar.

My approach in the current paper isto explore this and other key themes inneurosemantics through the use of computermodels of neural networks embodied and evolvedin virtual organisms. The models allow for thelaying bare of the causal economies of entireyet simple artificial organisms so that therelations between the neural bases of, forinstance, representation in perception andmemory can be regarded in the context of anentire organism.

Many theorists are sympathetic with the dynamical characterisation of connectionism and the general (re)conception of cognition that it affords. But in all the excitement surrounding the connectionist revolution in cognitive science, it has largely gone unnoticed that connectionism adds to the traditional focus on computational processes, a new focus Â one on the vehicles of mental representation, on the entities that carry content through the mind. Indeed, if Horgan and TiensonÂs dynamical characterisation of connectionism is on the right track, then so intimate is the relationship between computational processes and representational vehicles, that connectionist cognitive science is committed to a resemblance theory of mental content Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/1675/3/Connectionism_Analogicity_and_Mental_Content.pdf http://cogprints.org/1675/0/Connectionism_Analogicity_and_Mental_Content.pdf O'Brien, Gerard Opie, Jonathan (2004). Notes toward a structuralist theory of mental representation. In Hugh Clapin (ed.), Representation in Mind . Elsevier. ( Google ) Abstract: Any creature that must move around in its environment to find nutrients and mates, in order to survive and reproduce, faces the problem of sensorimotor control. A solution to this problem requires an on-board control mechanism that can shape the creatureâs behaviour so as to render it âappropriateâ to the conditions that obtain. There are at least three ways in which such a control mechanism can work, and Nature has exploited them all. The first and most basic way is for a creature to bump into the things in its environment, and then, depending on what has been encountered, seek to modify its behaviour accordingly. Such an approach is risky, however, since some things in the environment are distinctly unfriendly. A second and better way, therefore, is for a creature to exploit ambient forms of energy that carry information about the distal structure of the environment. This is an improvement on the first method since it enables the creature to respond to the surroundings without actually bumping into anything. Nonetheless, this second method also has its limitations, one of which is that the information conveyed by such ambient energy is often impoverished, ambiguous and intermittent Place, Ullin T.

The proposal is that the vehicles of content in some connectionist systems are clusters in the state space of a hidden layer.

Many have simply assumed that distribution is merely an implementation issue, and that symbolic mechanisms can be designed to take advantage of the virtues of distribution if so desired. Others, meanwhile, see the use of distributed representation as marking a fundamental difference between the two approaches.

There's no reason why folk psychology shouldn't be reducible, in a homogeneous or heterogeneous way. Abstract: Â Â Recently some philosophers have urged that connectionist artificial intelligence is (potentially) eliminative for the propositional attitudes of folk psychology. At the same time, however, these philosophers have also insisted that since philosophy of science has failed to provide criteria distinguishing ontologically retentive from eliminative theory changes, the resulting eliminativism is not principled. Application of some resources developed within the semantic view of scientific theories, particularly recent formal work on the theory reduction relation, reveals these philosophers to be wrong in this second contention, yet by and large correct in the first Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/PK525K2222273073.pdf Botterill, George (1994).

( Google | More links ) Abstract: In their historical overview of cognitive science, Bechtel, Abraham- son and Graham (1999) describe the ï¬eld as expanding in focus be- ginning in the mid-1980s. The ï¬eld had spent the previous 25 years on internalist, high-level GOFAI (âgood old fashioned artiï¬cial intelli- genceâ [Haugeland 1985]), and was ï¬nally moving âoutwards into the environment and downards into the brainâ (Bechtel et al, 1999, p.75). One important force behind the downward movement was Patricia Churchlandâs Neurophilosophy (1986). This book began a movement bearing its name, one that truly came of age in 1999 when Kath- leen Akins won a million-dollar fellowship to begin the McDonnell Project in Philosophy and the Neurosciences. The McDonnell Project put neurophilosophy at the forefront of philosophy of mind and cogni- tive science, yielding proliferating articles, conferences, special journal issues and books. In two major new books, neurophilosophers Patricia Churchland (2002) and John Bickle (2003) clearly feel this newfound prominence: Churchland mocks those who do not apply ï¬ndings in neuroscience to philosophical problems as âno-brainersâ; Bickle mocks anyone with traditional philosophical concerns, including ânaturalistic philosophers of mindâ and other neurophilosophers Additional links for this entry: http://edisk.fandm.edu/tony.chemero/papers/bickchurchrev.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/m812557162027h08/fulltext.pdf Clark, Andy (1989).

Connectionism has symbols that interact, and has propositional modularity in processing if not in storage. Abstract: Â Â Ramsey, Stich and Garon's recent paper Connectionism, Eliminativism, and the Future of Folk Psychology claims a certain style of connectionism to be the final nail in the coffin of folk psychology. I argue that their paper fails to show this, and that the style of connectionism they illustrate can in fact supplement, rather than compete with, the claims of a theory of cognition based in folk psychology's ontology. Ramsey, Stich and Garon's argument relies on the lack of easily identifiable symbols inside the connectionist network they discuss, and they suggest that the existence of a system which behaves in a cognitively interesting way, but which cannot be explained by appeal to internal symbol processing, falsifies central assumptions of folk psychology. My claim is that this argument is flawed, and that the theorist need not discard folk psychology in order to accept that the network illustrated exhibits cognitively interesting behaviour, even if it is conceded that symbols cannot be readily identified within the network Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/j71587tqw5g8141r/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/J71587TQW5G8141R.pdf Clark, Andy (1990).

This line of reasoning has it that if connectionist models turn out accurately to characterize our cognition, then beliefs, desires and the other intentional entities of commonsense psychology will be eliminated from our theoretical ontology. In complete contrast I argue (1) that not only is this line of reasoning mistaken about the eliminativist tendencies of connectionist models, but (2) that these models have the potential to provide a more robust vindication of commonsense psychology than classical computational models Additional links for this entry: http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a793921812~fulltext=713240930 O'Leary-Hawthorne, John (1994).

Philosophical Psychology 7 (4):453-61. ( Cited by 2 | Annotation | Google ) Upon examination, the model of Forster and Saidel 1994 does not exhibit features that are both distributed and causally discrete. Abstract: In âConnectionism and the fats of folk psychologyâ, Forster and Saidel argue that the central claim of Ramsey, Stich and Garon (1991)âthat distributed connectionist models are incompatible with the causal discreteness of folk psychologyâis mistaken. To establish their claim, they offer an intriguing model which allegedly shows how distributed representations can function in a causally discrete manner. They also challenge our position regarding projectibility of folk psychology. In this essay, I offer a response to their account and show how their model fails to demonstrate that our original argument was mistaken. While I will discuss several difficulties with their model, my primary criticism will be that the features of their model that are causally discrete are not truly distributed, while the features that are distributed are not really discrete. Concerning the issue of projectibility, I am more inclined to agree with Forster and Saidel and I offer a revised account of what we should have said originally Skokowski, Paul G. (ms).

Synthese 101 (3):465-92. ( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Terry Horgan and John Tienson have suggested that connectionism might provide a framework within which to articulate a theory of cognition according to which there are mental representations without rules (RWR) (Horgan and Tienson 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992). In essence, RWR states that cognition involves representations in a language of thought, but that these representations are not manipulated by the sort of rules that have traditionally been posited. In the development of RWR, Horgan and Tienson attempt to forestall a particular line of criticism, theSyntactic Argument, which would show RWR to be inconsistent with connectionism. In essence, the argument claims that the node-level rules of connectionist networks, along with the semantic interpretations assigned to patterns of activation, serve to determine a set of representation-level rules incompatible with the RWR conception of cognition. The present paper argues that the Syntactic Argument can be made to show that RWR is inconsistent with connectionism Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/W30780736G40M071.pdf Aydede, Murat (1995).

Some connectionists declined to meet the challenge on the basis that the alleged regularities are somehow spurious. Some, like Smolensky, however, took the challenge very seriously, and attempted to meet it by developing models that are supposed to be non-classical beim Graben, Peter (2004). Incompatible implementations of physical symbol systems. Mind and Matter 2 (2):29-51. ( Google ) Abstract: Classical cognitive science assumes that intelligently behaving systems must be symbol processors that are implemented in physical systems such as brains or digital computers. By contrast, connectionists suppose that symbol manipulating systems could be approximations of neural networks dynamics. Both classicists and connectionists argue that symbolic computation and subsymbolic dynamics are incompatible, though on different grounds. While classicists say that connectionist architectures and symbol processors are either incompatible or the former are mere implementations of the latter, connectionists reply that neural networks might be incompatible with symbol processors because the latter cannot be implementations of the former. In this contribution, the notions of 'incompatibility' and 'implementation' will be criticized to show that they must be revised in the context of the dynamical system approach to cognitive science. Examples for implementations of symbol processors that are incompatible with respect to contextual topologies will be discussed Bringsjord, Selmer (1991).

The language of thought hypothesis plays a pivotal role. The connectionist paradigm is opposed to the language of thought; and there is an argument for the language of thought that draws on features of the commonsense scheme of thoughts, concepts, and inference. Most of the paper (Sections 3-7) is taken up with the argument for the language of thought hypothesis. The argument for an opposition between connectionism and the language of thought comes towards the end (Section 8), along with some discussion of the potential eliminativist consequences (Sections 9 and Dawson, Michael R.

However, connectionists rarely test this belief by interpreting the internal structure of their nets. A new approach to interpreting networks was recently introduced by Berkeley et al. (1995). The current paper examines two implications of applying this method: (1) that the internal structure of a connectionist network can have a very classical appearance, and (2) that this interpretation can provide a cognitive theory that cannot be dismissed as a mere implementation Dennett, Daniel C.

Abstract: In 1982, Feldman and Ballard published "Connectionist models and their properties" in Cognitive Science , helping to focus attention on a family of similarly inspired research strategies just then under way, by giving the family a name: "connectionism." Now, seven years later, the connectionist nation has swelled to include such subfamilies as "PDP" and "neural net models." Since the ideological foes of connectionism are keen to wipe it out in one fell swoop aimed at its "essence", it is worth noting the diversity of not only the models but also the aspirations of the modelers. There is no good reason to suppose that they all pledge allegiance to any one principle..

Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the âsystematicityâ of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents.

( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue that any successful model of cognition must use classical architecture; it must depend upon rule-based processing sensitive to constituent structure. This claim is central to their defense of classical AI against the recent enthusiasm for connectionism. Connectionist nets, they contend, may serve as theories of the implementation of cognition, but never as proper theories of psychology. Connectionist models are doomed to describing the brain at the wrong level, leaving the classical view to account for the mind.This paper considers whether recent results in connectionist research weigh against Fodor and Pylyshyn's thesis. The investigation will force us to develop criteria for determining exactly when a net is capable of systematic processing. Fodor and Pylyshyn clearly intend their thesis to affect the course of research in psychology. I will argue that when systematicity is defined in a way that makes the thesis relevant in this way, the thesis is challenged by recent progress in connectionism Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/P4414695610528G3.pdf Garson, James W.

Connectionist languages of thought. ( Cited by 1 | Google ) Abstract: Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) have presented an influential argument to the effect that any viable connectionist account of human cognition must implement a language of thought. Their basic strategy is to argue that connectionist models that do not implement a language of thought fail to account for the systematic relations among propositional attitudes. Several critics of the LOT hypothesis have tried to pinpoint flaws in Fodor and Pylyshynâs argument (Smolensky 1989; Clark, 1989; Chalmers, 1990; Braddon-Mitchell and Fitzpatrick, 1990). One thing I will try to show is that the argument can be rescued from these criticisms. (Score: LOT 1, Visitors 0.) However, I agree that the argument fails, and I will provide a new account of how it goes wrong. (The score becomes tied.) Of course, the failure of Fodor and Pylyshynâs argument does not mean that their conclusion is false. Consequently, some connectionist criticisms of Fodor and Pylyshynâs article take the form of direct counterexamples to their conclusion (Smolensky 1989; van Gelder, 1990; Chalmers, 1990). I will argue, however, that Fodor and Pylyshynâs conclusion survives confrontation with the alleged counterexamples. Finally, I provide an alternative argument that may succeed where Fodor and Pylyshynâs fails. (Final Score: LOT 3, Visitors 1.) Markic, Olga (1999).

Abstract: Â Â There is currently a debate over whether cognitive architecture is classical or connectionist in nature. One finds the following three comparisons between classical architecture and connectionist architecture made in the pro-connectionist literature in this debate: (1) connectionist architecture is neurally plausible and classical architecture is not; (2) connectionist architecture is far better suited to model pattern recognition capacities than is classical architecture; and (3) connectionist architecture is far better suited to model the acquisition of pattern recognition capacities by learning than is classical architecture. If true, (1)â(3) would yield a compelling case against the view that cognitive architecture is classical, and would offer some reason to think that cognitive architecture may be connectionist. We first present the case for (1)â(3) in the very words of connectionist enthusiasts. We then argue that the currently available evidence fails to support any of (1)â(3) Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/V2103368752NX552.pdf Rey, Georges (1991).

In part one, I provide three arguments for the individuation of primitive symbols in terms of total computational role. The first of these arguments claims that Classicism requires that primitive symbols be typed in this manner; no other theory of typing will suffice. The second argument contends that without this manner of symbol individuation, there will be computational processes that fail to supervene on syntax, together with the rules of composition and the computational algorithms. The third argument says that cognitive science needs a natural kind that is typed by total computational role. Otherwise, either cognitive science will be incomplete, or its laws will have counterexamples. Then, part two defends this view from a criticism, offered by both Jerry Fodor and Jesse Prinz, who respond to my view with the charge that because the types themselves are individuated Additional links for this entry: http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/SchneiderNatureSymbolsMindLang.doc http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/SchneiderNatureSymbolsMindLang-1-2.pdf http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~sls/documents/Schneider-MindLangSymbols.pdf ter Hark, Michel (1995).

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Berkeley [Minds Machines 10 (2000) 1] described a methodology that showed the subsymbolic nature of an artificial neural network system that had been trained on a logic problem, originally described by Bechtel and Abrahamsen [Connectionism and the mind. Blackwells, Cambridge, MA, 1991]. It was also claimed in the conclusion of this paper that the evidence was suggestive that the network might, in fact, count as a symbolic system. Dawson and Piercey [Minds Machines 11 (2001) 197] took issue with this latter claim. They described some lesioning studies that they argued showed that Berkeleyâs (2000) conclusions were premature. In this paper, these lesioning studies are replicated and it is shown that the effects that Dawson and Piercey rely upon for their argument are merely an artifact of a threshold function they chose to employ. When a threshold function much closer to that deployed in the original studies is used, the significant effects disappear Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/g46288063247n5nv/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/G46288063247N5NV.pdf Berkeley, Istvan S.

( Cited by 5 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In 1988, Smolensky proposed that connectionist processing systems should be understood as operating at what he termed the `subsymbolic'' level. Subsymbolic systems should be understood by comparing them to symbolic systems, in Smolensky''s view. Up until recently, there have been real problems with analyzing and interpreting the operation of connectionist systems which have undergone training. However, recently published work on a network trained on a set of logic problems originally studied by Bechtel and Abrahamsen (1991) seems to offer the potential to provide a detailed, empirically based answer to questions about the nature of subsymbols. In this paper, a network analysis procedure and the results obtained using it are discussed. This provides the basis for an insight into the nature of subsymbols, which is surprising Additional links for this entry: http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~isb9112/dept/phil341/subsymbol/subsymbol.html http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/g81p084q505n1210/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/g81p084q505n1210/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=258824=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/G81P084Q505N1210.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2000/00000010/00000001/00258824 Chalmers, David J. (1992). Subsymbolic computation and the chinese room. In J. Dinsmore (ed.), The Symbolic and Connectionist Paradigms: Closing the Gap . Lawrence Erlbaum. ( Cited by 29 | Annotation | Google | More links ) Gives an account of symbolic vs. subsymbolic computation, and argues that the latter is less vulnerable to the Chinese-room intuition, as representations there are not computational tokens. Abstract: More than a decade ago, philosopher John Searle started a long-running controversy with his paper âMinds, Brains, and Programsâ (Searle, 1980a), an attack on the ambitious claims of artificial intelligence (AI). With his now famous _Chinese Room_ argument, Searle claimed to show that despite the best efforts of AI researchers, a computer could never recreate such vital properties of human mentality as intentionality, subjectivity, and understanding. The AI research program is based on the underlying assumption that all important aspects of human cognition may in principle be captured in a computational model. This assumption stems from the belief that beyond a certain level, implementational details are irrelevant to cognition. According to this belief, neurons, and biological wetware in general, have no preferred status as the substrate for a mind. As it happens, the best examples of minds we have at present have arisen from a carbon-based substrate, but this is due to constraints of evolution and possibly historical accidents, rather than to an absolute metaphysical necessity. As a result of this belief, many cognitive scientists have chosen to focus not on the biological substrate of the mind, but instead on the abstract causal structure_ _that the mind embodies (at an appropriate level of abstraction). The view that it is abstract causal structure that is essential to mentality has been an implicit assumption of the AI research program since Turing (1950), but was first articulated explicitly, in various forms, by Putnam (1960), Armstrong (1970) and Lewis (1970), and has become known as _functionalism_. From here, it is a very short step to _computationalism_, the view that computational structure is what is important in capturing the essence of mentality. This step follows from a belief that any abstract causal structure can be captured computationally: a belief made plausible by the ChurchâTuring Thesis, which articulates the power Additional links for this entry: http://consc.net/papers/subsymbolic.pdf http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chalmers92subsymbolic.html http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/subsymbolic.pdf Clark, Andy (1993). Superpositional connectionism: A reply to Marinov. Minds and Machines 3 (3):271-81. ( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Marinov''s critique I argue, is vitiated by its failure to recognize the distinctive role of superposition within the distributed connectionist paradigm. The use of so-called subsymbolic distributed encodings alone is not, I agree, enough to justify treating distributed connectionism as a distinctive approach. It has always been clear that microfeatural decomposition is both possible and actual within the confines of recognizably classical approaches. When such approaches also involve statistically-driven learning algorithms â as in the case of ID3 â the fundamental differences become even harder to spot. To see them, it is necessary to consider not just the nature of an acquired input-output function but the nature of the representational scheme underlying it. Differences between such schemes make themselves best felt outside the domain of immediate problem solving. It is in the more extended contexts of performance DURING learning and cognitive change as a result of SUBSEQUENT training on new tasks (or simultaneous training on several tasks) that the effects of superpositional storage techniques come to the fore. I conclude that subsymbols, distribution and statistically driven learning alone are indeed not of the essence. But connectionism is not just about subsymbols and distribution. It is about the generation of whole subsymbol SYSTEMS in which multiple distributed representations are created and superposed Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/l11l1130450x265x/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/L11L1130450X265X.pdf Cleeremans, Axel (1998).

Abstract: Â Â The article criticises the attempt to establish connectionism as an alternative theory of human cognitive architecture through the introduction of thesymbolic/subsymbolic distinction (Smolensky, 1988). The reasons for the introduction of this distinction are discussed and found to be unconvincing. It is shown that thebrittleness problem has been solved for a large class ofsymbolic learning systems, e.g. the class oftop-down induction of decision-trees (TDIDT) learning systems. Also, the process of articulating expert knowledge in rules seems quite practical for many important domains, including common sense knowledge.The article discusses several experimental comparisons betweenTDIDT systems and artificial neural networks using the error backpropagation algorithm (ANNs usingBP). The properties of one of theTDIDT systemsID3 (Quinlan, 1986a) are examined in detail. It is argued that the differences in performance betweenANNs usingBP andTDIDT systems reflect slightly different inductive biases but are not systematic; these differences do not support the view that symbolic and subsymbolic systems are fundamentally incompatible. It is concluded, that thesymbolic/subsymbolic distinction is spurious. It cannot establish connectionism as an alternative cognitive architecture Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/NH755160272VV7JH.pdf Rosenberg, Jay F. (1990).

Abstract: Â Â Contemporary epistemology has assumed that knowledge is represented in sentences or propositions. However, a variety of extensions and alternatives to this view have been proposed in other areas of investigation. We review some of these proposals, focusing on (1) Ryle's notion of knowing how and Hanson's and Kuhn's accounts of theory-laden perception in science; (2) extensions of simple propositional representations in cognitive models and artificial intelligence; (3) the debate concerning imagistic versus propositional representations in cognitive psychology; (4) recent treatments of concepts and categorization which reject the notion of necessary and sufficient conditions; and (5) parallel distributed processing (connectionist) models of cognition. This last development is especially promising in providing a flexible, powerful means of representing information nonpropositionally, and carrying out at least simple forms of inference without rules. Central to several of the proposals is the notion that much of human cognition might consist in pattern recognition rather than manipulation of rules and propositions Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/WW512705U27062RV.pdf Bechtel, William P. (1988). Connectionism and rules and representation systems: Are they compatible? Philosophical Psychology 1 (1):5-16. ( Cited by 43 | Annotation | Google ) There's room for both styles within a single mind. The rule-based level needn't be autonomous; the connectionist level plays a role in pattern recognition, concepts, and so on. Abstract: The introduction of connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) systems to model cognitive functions has raised the question of the possible relations between these models and traditional information processing models which employ rules to manipulate representations. After presenting a brief account of PDP models and two ways in which they are commonly interpreted by those seeking to use them to explain cognitive functions, I present two ways one might relate these models to traditional information processing models and so not totally repudiate the tradition of modelling cognition through systems of rules and representations. The proposal that seems most promising is that PDP-type structures might provide the underlying framework in which a rule and representation model might be implemented. To show how one might pursue such a strategy, I discuss recent research by Barsalou on the instability of concepts and show how that might be accounted for in a system whose microstructure had a PDP architecture. I also outline how adopting a multi-leveled view of the mind, where on one level the mind employed a PDP-type system and at another level constituted a rule processing system, would allow researchers to relocate some problems which seemed difficult to explain at one level, such as the capacity for concept learning, to another level where it could be handled in a straightforward manner Bechtel, William P.

( Cited by 1 | Google ) Abstract: According to the standard (recent) history of connectionism (see for example the accounts offered by Hecht-Nielsen (1990: pp. 14-19) and Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1988), or Papert's (1988: pp. 3-4) somewhat whimsical description), in the early days of Classical Computational Theory of Mind (CCTM) based AI research, there was also another allegedly distinct approach, one based upon network models. The work on network models seems to fall broadly within the scope of the term 'connectionist' (see Aizawa 1992), although the term had yet to be coined at the time. These two approaches were "two daughter sciences" according to Papert (1988: p. 3). The fundamental difference between these two 'daughters', lay (according to Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1988: p. 16)) in what they took to be the paradigm of intelligence. Whereas the early connectionists took learning to be fundamental, the traditional school concentrated upon problem solving Berkeley, IstvÃ¡n S. N. (online). Some myths of connectionism. (Cited by 1 | Google ) Abstract: Since the emergence of what Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) call 'new connectionism', there can be little doubt that connectionist research has become a significant topic for discussion in the Philosophy of Cognitive Science and the Philosophy of Mind. In addition to the numerous papers on the topic in philosophical journals, almost every recent book in these areas contain at least a brief reference to, or discussion of, the issues raised by connectionist research (see Sterelny 1990, Searle, 1992, and O NuallÃ¡in, 1995, for example). Other texts have focused almost exclusively upon connectionist issues (see Clark, 1993, Bechtel and Abrahamsen, 1991 and Lloyd, 1989, for example). Regrettably the discussions of connectionism found in the philosophical literature suffer from a number of deficiencies. My purpose in this paper is to highlight one particular problem and attempt to take a few steps to remedy the situation Berkeley, Istvan S. N. (online). What is connectionism? ( Google ) Abstract: Connectionism is a style of modeling based upon networks of interconnected simple processing devices. This style of modeling goes by a number of other names too. Connectionist models are also sometimes referred to as 'Parallel Distributed Processing' (or PDP for short) models or networks.1 Connectionist systems are also sometimes referred to as 'neural networks' (abbreviated to NNs) or 'artificial neural networks' (abbreviated to ANNs). Although there may be some rhetorical appeal to this neural nomenclature, it is in fact misleading as connectionist networks are commonly significantly dissimilar to neurological systems. For this reason, I will avoid using this terminology, other than in direct quotations. Instead, I will follow the practice I have adopted above and use 'connectionist' as my primary term for systems of this kind Bickle, John (1995). Connectionism, reduction, and multiple realizability.

Connectionism, competence and explanation. British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 41 (June):195-222. ( Cited by 25 | Annotation | Google | More links ) Abstract: A competence model describes the abstract structure of a solution to some problem. or class of problems, facing the would-be intelligent system. Competence models can be quite derailed, specifying far more than merely the function to be computed. But for all that, they are pitched at some level of abstraction from the details of any particular algorithm or processing strategy which may be said to realize the competence. Indeed, it is the point and virtue of such models to specify some equivalence class of algorithms/processing strategies so that the common properties highlighted by the chosen class may feature in psychologically interesting accounts. A question arises concerning the type of relation a theorist might expect to hold between such a competence model and a psychologically real processing strategy. Classical work in cognitive science expects the actual processing to depend on explicit or tacit knowledge of the competence theory. Connectionist work, for reasons to be explained, represents a departure from this norm. But the precise way in which a connectionist approach may disturb the satisfying classical symmetry of competence and processing has yet to be properly specified. A standard ?Newtonian? connectionist account, due to Paul Smolensky, is discussed and contrasted with a somewhat different ?rogue? account. A standard connectionist understanding has it that a classical competence theory describes an idealized subset of a network's behaviour. But the network's behaviour is not to be explained by its embodying explicit or tacit knowledge of the information laid out in the competence theory. A rogue model, by contrast, posits either two systems, or two aspects of a single system, such that one system does indeed embody the knowledge laid out in the competence theory Additional links for this entry: http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/195 http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/2/195 http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/687772.pdf Clark, Andy (1995).

Abstract: In this paper, I define tacit knowledge as a kind of causal-explanatory structure, mirroring the derivational structure in the theory that is tacitly known. On this definition, tacit knowledge does not have to be explicitly represented. I then take the notion of a modular theory, and project the idea of modularity to several different levels of description: in particular, to the processing level and the neurophysiological level. The fundamental description of a connectionist network lies at a level between the processing level and the physiological level. At this level, connectionism involves a characteristic departure from modularity, and a correlative absence of syntactic structure. This is linked to the fact that tacit knowledge descriptions of networks are only approximately true. A consequence is that strict causal systematicity in cognitive processes poses a problem for the connectionist programme Additional links for this entry: http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/40/4/541 http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/40/4/541 http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/687740.pdf Duran, Jane Doell, Ruth (1993).

First diff rance , as the crossing of Saussurian difference and Freudian deferral, is modeled and then the fuller 'sheaf of diff rance is taken up. The metaphysically conceived brain has two versions: in the traditional computational version the brain processes information like a computer and in the connectionist version the brain computes input vector to output vector transformations non-symbolically. The 'deconstructed brain' neither processes information nor computes functions but is spontaneously economical Hadley, Robert F. (1999). Connectionism and novel combinations of skills: Implications for cognitive architecture. Minds and Machines 9 (2):197-221. ( Cited by 11 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â In the late 1980s, there were many who heralded the emergence of connectionism as a new paradigm â one which would eventually displace the classically symbolic methods then dominant in AI and Cognitive Science. At present, there remain influential connectionists who continue to defend connectionism as a more realistic paradigm for modeling cognition, at all levels of abstraction, than the classical methods of AI. Not infrequently, one encounters arguments along these lines: given what we know about neurophysiology, it is just not plausible to suppose that our brains are digital computers. Thus, they could not support a classical architecture. I argue here for a middle ground between connectionism and classicism. I assume, for argument's sake, that some form(s) of connectionism can provide reasonably approximate models â at least for lower-level cognitive processes. Given this assumption, I argue on theoretical and empirical grounds that most human mental skills must reside in separate connectionist modules or sub-networks. Ultimately, it is argued that the basic tenets of connectionism, in conjunction with the fact that humans often employ novel combinations of skill modules in rule following and problem solving, lead to the plausible conclusion that, in certain domains, high level cognition requires some form of classical architecture. During the course of argument, it emerges that only an architecture with classical structure could support the novel patterns of information flow and interaction that would exist among the relevant set of modules. Such a classical architecture might very well reside in the abstract levels of a hybrid system whose lower-level modules are purely connectionist Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596712.596817 http://www.springerlink.com/content/l64416n38j41q278/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=206285=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/L64416N38J41Q278.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1999/00000009/00000002/00206285 Hatfield, Gary (1990).

(1997). Modelling the noncomputational mind: Reply to Litch. Philosophical Psychology 10 (3):365-371. ( Google ) Abstract: I explain why, within the nonclassical framework for cognitive science we describe in the book, cognitive-state transitions can fail to be tractably computable even if they are subserved by a discrete dynamical system whose mathematical-state transitions are tractably computable. I distinguish two ways that cognitive processing might conform to programmable rules in which all operations that apply to representation-level structure are primitive, and two corresponding constraints on models of cognition. Although Litch is correct in maintaining that classical cognitive science is not committed to the first constraint, it is committed to the second. This fact constitutes an illuminating gloss on our claim that one foundational assumption of classicism is that human cognition conforms to programmable, representation-level, rules Horgan, Terence E.

With this analysis in hand, one may ask the question: are connectionist-based systems consistent with the computational model of the mind?

Radical connectionism: Thinking with (not in) language. Language and Communication 22 (3):313-329. ( Cited by 12 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In this paper we defend a position we call radical connectionism. Radical connectionism claims that cognition _never_ implicates an internal symbolic medium, not even when natural language plays a part in our thought processes. On the face of it, such a position renders the human capacity for abstract thought quite mysterious. However, we argue that connectionism is committed to an analog conception of neural computation, and that representation of the abstract is no more problematic for a system of analog vehicles than for a symbol system. Natural language is therefore not required as a representational medium for abstract thought. Since natural language is arguably not a representational medium _at all_, but a conventionally governed scheme of communicative signals, we suggest that the role of internalised (i.e., self- directed) language is best conceived in terms of the coordination and control of cognitive activities within the brain Additional links for this entry: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271530902000101 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/02715309/2002/00000022/00000003/art00010 Piccinini, Gualtiero (2007).

(3) Connectionist systems do not execute programs. Many authors embrace (2). This leads them to a dilemma: either connectionist systems execute programs or they don't compute. Accordingly, some authors attempt to deny (1), while others attempt to deny (3). But as I will argue, there are compelling reasons to accept both (1) and (3). So, we should replace (2) with a more satisfactory account of computation. Once we do, we can see more clearly what is peculiar to connectionist computation. Place, Ullin T. (1999).

Conclusion: not too much. Abstract: Â Â Along with the increasing popularity of connectionist language models has come a number of provocative suggestions about the challenge these models present to Chomsky's arguments for nativism. The aim of this paper is to assess these claims. We begin by reconstructing Chomsky's argument from the poverty of the stimulus and arguing that it is best understood as three related arguments, with increasingly strong conclusions. Next, we provide a brief introduction to connectionism and give a quick survey of recent efforts to develop networks that model various aspects of human linguistic behavior. Finally, we explore the implications of this research for Chomsky's arguments. Our claim is that the relation between connectionism and Chomsky's views on innate knowledge is more complicated than many have assumed, and that even if these models enjoy considerable success the threat they pose for linguistic nativism is small Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/p66n338hjq44332p/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/P66N338HJQ44332P.pdf Ramsey, William ; Stich, Stephen P.

( Cited by 46 | Google ) Abstract: The philosophy of cognitive science has recently become one of the most exciting and fastest growing domains of philosophical inquiry and analysis. Until the early 1980s, nearly all of the models developed treated cognitive processes -- like problem solving, language comprehension, memory, and higher visual processing -- as rule-governed symbol manipulation. However, this situation has changed dramatically over the last half dozen years. In that period there has been an enormous shift of attention toward connectionist models of cognition that are inspired by the network-like architecture of the brain. Because of their unique architecture and style of processing, connectionist systems are generally regarded as radically different from the more traditional symbol manipulation models. This collection was designed to provide philosophers who have been working in the area of cognitive science with a forum for expressing their views on these recent developments. Because the symbol-manipulating paradigm has been so important to the work of contemporary philosophers, many have watched the emergence of connectionism with considerable interest. The contributors take very different stands toward connectionism, but all agree that the potential exists for a radical shift in the way many philosophers think of various aspects of cognition. Exploring this potential and other philosophical dimensions of connectionist research is the aim of this volume Rosenberg, Jay F. (1989). Connectionism and cognition. Bielefeld Report .

I argue against this construal, drawing on Ramsey et al.'s paper, âConnectionism, eliminativism, and the future of folk psychologyâ. I argue that if certain connec-tionist models are correct, then mental states cannot be identified with functionally discrete causes of behavior, and I respond to some recent attempts to deny this claim. However, I further contend that our common sense psychological practices are not committed to the falsity of such connectionist models. The paper concludes that common sense psychology is not committed to the identification of mental states with functionally discrete causes of behavior, and hence that common sense psychology is not committed to the causal account of action explanation Shanon, Benny (1992).

Abstract: In their critique of connectionist models Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) dismiss such models as not being cognitive or psychological. Evaluating Fodor and Pylyshyn's critique requires examining what is required in characterizating models as 'cognitive'. The present discussion examines the various senses of this term. It argues the answer to the title question seems to vary with these different senses. Indeed, by one sense of the term, neither representa-tionalism nor connectionism is cognitive.

( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In this paper the issue of drawing inferences about biological cognitive systems on the basis of connectionist simulations is addressed. In particular, the justification of inferences based on connectionist models trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm is examined. First it is noted that a justification commonly found in the philosophical literature is inapplicable. Then some general issues are raised about the relationships between models and biological systems. A way of conceiving the role of hidden units in connectionist networks is then introduced. This, in combination with an assumption about the way evolution goes about solving problems, is then used to suggest a means of justifying inferences about biological systems based on connectionist research Additional links for this entry: http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~isb9112/dept/phil341/conrecon/conrecon.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:1975 http://cogprints.org/1975/3/CReconF.pdf http://cogprints.org/1975/0/CReconF.pdf Clark, Andy (1994).

Concentrates on incremental learning, and other developmental/scaffolding strategies. With remarks on systematicity. Abstract: Â Â The paper considers the problems involved in getting neural networks to learn about highly structured task domains. A central problem concerns the tendency of networks to learn only a set of shallow (non-generalizable) representations for the task, i.e., to miss the deep organizing features of the domain. Various solutions are examined, including task specific network configuration and incremental learning. The latter strategy is the more attractive, since it holds out the promise of a task-independent solution to the problem. Once we see exactly how the solution works, however, it becomes clear that it is limited to a special class of cases in which (1) statistically driven undersampling is (luckily) equivalent to task decomposition, and (2) the dangers of unlearning are somehow being minimized. The technique is suggestive nonetheless, for a variety of developmental factors may yield the functional equivalent of both statistical AND informed undersampling in early learning Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/r7812132kh676544/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/r7812132kh676544/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/R7812132KH676544.pdf Clark, Andy Thornton, S.

Autonomous processing in parallel distributed processing networks. Philosophical Psychology 5 (2):199-219. ( Google ) Abstract: This paper critically examines the claim that parallel distributed processing (PDP) networks are autonomous learning systems. A PDP model of a simple distributed associative memory is considered. It is shown that the 'generic' PDP architecture cannot implement the computations required by this memory system without the aid of external control. In other words, the model is not autonomous. Two specific problems are highlighted: (i) simultaneous learning and recall are not permitted to occur as would be required of an autonomous system; (ii) connections between processing units cannot simultaneously represent current and previous network activation as would be required if learning is to occur. Similar problems exist for more sophisticated networks constructed from the generic PDP architecture. We argue that this is because these models are not adequately constrained by the properties of the functional architecture assumed by PDP modelers. It is also argued that without such constraints, PDP researchers cannot claim to have developed an architecture radically different from that proposed by the Classical approach in cognitive science Franklin, James (1996).

The argument proceeds by showing that what is essential to running a program is preserving the functional structure of the program. It has generally been assumed that this can only be done by systems possessing a certain temporalcausal organization. However, counterfactualpreserving functional architecture can be instantiated in other ways, for example geometrically, which are realizable by connectionist networks Additional links for this entry: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118696238/PDFSTART 6.4 Special Topics in AI Rhodes, Kris (ms).

( Google | More links ) Abstract: The ethical issues related to the possible future creation of machines with general intellectual capabilities far outstripping those of humans are quite distinct from any ethical problems arising in current automation and information systems. Such superintelligence would not be just another technological development; it would be the most important invention ever made, and would lead to explosive progress in all scientific and technological fields, as the superintelligence would conduct research with superhuman efficiency. To the extent that ethics is a cognitive pursuit, a superintelligence could also easily surpass humans in the quality of its moral thinking. However, it would be up to the designers of the superintelligence to specify its original motivations. Since the superintelligence may become unstoppably powerful because of its intellectual superiority and the technologies it could develop, it is crucial that it be provided with human-friendly motivations. This paper surveys some of the unique ethical issues in creating superintelligence, and discusses what motivations we ought to give a superintelligence, and introduces some cost-benefit considerations relating to whether the development of superintelligent machines ought to be accelerated or retarded Additional links for this entry: http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html Bostrom, Nick (1998).

When machines outsmart humans. ( Google ) Abstract: Artificial intelligence is a possibility that should not be ignored in any serious thinking about the future, and it raises many profound issues for ethics and public policy that philosophers ought to start thinking about. This article outlines the case for thinking that human-level machine intelligence might well appear within the next half century. It then explains four immediate consequences of such a development, and argues that machine intelligence would have a revolutionary impact on a wide range of the social, political, economic, commercial, technological, scientific and environmental issues that humanity will face over the coming decades Chalmers, David J. , The singularity: A philosophical analysis. ( Google ) Abstract: What happens when machines become more intelligent than humans? One view is that this event will be followed by an explosion to ever-greater levels of intelligence, as each generation of machines creates more intelligent machines in turn. This intelligence explosion is now often known as the âsingularityâ. The basic argument here was set out by the statistician I.J. Good in his 1965 article âSpeculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machineâ: Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an âintelligence explosionâ, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make. The key idea is that a machine that is more intelligent than humans will be better than humans at designing machines. So it will be capable of designing a machine more intelligent than the most intelligent machine that humans can design. So if it is itself designed by humans, it will be capable of designing a machine more intelligent than itself. By similar reasoning, this next machine will also be capable of designing a machine more intelligent than itself. If every machine in turn does what it is capable of, we should expect a sequence of ever more intelligent machines. This intelligence explosion is sometimes combined with another idea, which we might call the âspeed explosionâ. The argument for a speed explosion starts from the familiar observation that computer processing speed doubles at regular intervals. Suppose that speed doubles every two years and will do so indefinitely. Now suppose that we have human-level artificial intelligence 1 designing new processors. Then faster processing will lead to faster designers and an ever-faster design cycle, leading to a limit point soon afterwards. The argument for a speed explosion was set out by the artificial intelligence researcher Ray Solomonoff in his 1985 article âThe Time Scale of Artificial Intelligenceâ.1 Eliezer Yudkowsky gives a succinct version of the argument in his 1996 article âStaring at the Singularityâ: âComputing speed doubles every two subjective years of work.. Hall, John Storrs (forthcoming). Self-improving AI: An analysis. Minds and Machines . ( Google ) Abstract: Self-improvement was one of the aspects of AI proposed for study in the 1956 Dartmouth conference. Turing proposed a âchild machineâ which could be taught in the human manner to attain adult human-level intelligence. In latter days, the contention that an AI system could be built to learn and improve itself indefinitely has acquired the label of the bootstrap fallacy. Attempts in AI to implement such a system have met with consistent failure for half a century. Technological optimists, however, have maintained that a such system is possible, producing, if implemented, a feedback loop that would lead to a rapid exponential increase in intelligence. We examine the arguments for both positions and draw some conclusions Hanson, Robin , Is a singularity just around the corner? ( Google ) Abstract: Economic growth is determined by the supply and demand of investment capital; technology determines the demand for capital, while human nature determines the supply. The supply curve has two distinct parts, giving the world economy two distinct modes. In the familiar slow growth mode, rates of return are limited by human discount rates. In the fast growth mode, investment is limited by the world's wealth. Historical trends suggest that we may transition to the fast mode in roughly another century and a half Vinge, Vernor (online).

Phenomena and mechanisms: Putting the symbolic, connectionist, and dynamical systems debate in broader perspective. In R. Stainton (ed.), Contemporary Debates in Cognitive Science . Basil Blackwell. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Cognitive science is, more than anything else, a pursuit of cognitive mechanisms. To make headway towards a mechanistic account of any particular cognitive phenomenon, a researcher must choose among the many architectures available to guide and constrain the account. It is thus fitting that this volume on contemporary debates in cognitive science includes two issues of architecture, each articulated in the 1980s but still unresolved: â¢ Just how modular is the mind? (section 1) â a debate initially pitting encapsulated mechanisms (Fodorian modules that feed their ultimate outputs to a nonmodular central cognition) against highly interactive ones (e.g., connectionist networks that continuously feed streams of output to one another). â¢ Does the mind process language-like representations according to formal rules? (this section) â a debate initially pitting symbolic architectures (such as Chomskyâs generative grammar or Fodorâs language of thought) against less language-like architectures (such as connectionist or dynamical ones). Our project here is to consider the second issue within the broader context of where cognitive science has been and where it is headed. The notion that cognition in generalânot just language processingâinvolves rules operating on language-like representations actually predates cognitive science. In traditional philosophy of mind, mental life is construed as involving propositional attitudesâthat is, such attitudes towards propositions as believing, fearing, and desiring that they be trueâand logical inferences from them. On this view, if a person desires that a proposition be true and believes that if she performs a certain action it will become true, she will make the inference and (absent any overriding consideration) perform the action Additional links for this entry: http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=BPLpA8As8Lm_kuVh5kiz4L2Xxuc Bechtel, William P. (online). Dynamics and decomposition: Are they compatible? ( Cited by 4 | Google ) Abstract: Much of cognitive neuroscience as well as traditional cognitive science is engaged in a quest for mechanisms through a project of decomposition and localization of cognitive functions. Some advocates of the emerging dynamical systems approach to cognition construe it as in opposition to the attempt to decompose and localize functions. I argue that this case is not established and rather explore how dynamical systems tools can be used to analyze and model cognitive functions without abandoning the use of decomposition and localization to understand mechanisms of cognition Bechtel, William P. (1998). Representations and cognitive explanations: Assessing the dynamicist challenge in cognitive science. Cognitive Science 22 (3):295-317. ( Cited by 64 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Advocates of dynamical systems theory (DST) sometimes employ revolutionary rhetoric. In an attempt to clarify how DST models differ from others in cognitive science, I focus on two issues raised by DST: the role for representations in mental models and the conception of explanation invoked. Two features of representations are their role in standing-in for features external to the system and their format. DST advocates sometimes claim to have repudiated the need for stand-ins in DST models, but I argue that they are mistaken. Nonetheless, DST does offer new ideas as to the format of representations employed in cognitive systems. With respect to explanation, I argue that some DST models are better seen as conforming to the covering-law conception of explanation than to the mechanistic conception of explanation implicit in most cognitive science research. But even here, I argue, DST models are a valuable complement to more mechanistic cognitive explanations Additional links for this entry: http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog2203_2 http://www.leaonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1207/s15516709cog2203_2 http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/CSJarchive/1998v22/i03/p0295p0318/MAIN.PDF http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03640213/1998/00000022/00000003/art80042 Bedau, Mark A. (1997). Emergent models of supple dynamics in life and mind. Brain and Cognition 34:5-27. (Cited by 12 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The dynamical patterns in mental phenomena have a characteristic supplenessa looseness or softness that persistently resists precise formulationwhich apparently underlies the frame problem of artificial intelligence. This suppleness also undermines contemporary philosophical functionalist attempts to define mental capacities. Living systems display an analogous form of supple dynamics. However, the supple dynamics of living systems have been captured in recent artificial life models, due to the emergent architecture of those models. This suggests that analogous emergent models might be able to explain supple dynamics of mental phenomena. These emergent models of the supple mind, if successful, would refashion the nature of contemporary functionalism in the philosophy of mind Additional links for this entry: http://people.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/emergent-models.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve=Citation http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/br/1997/00000034/00000001/art00904 Chemero, Anthony (2000). Anti-representationalism and the dynamical stance. Philosophy of Science 67 (4):625-647. ( Cited by 12 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Arguments in favor of anti-representationalism in cognitive science often suffer from a lack of attention to detail. The purpose of this paper is to fill in the gaps in these arguments, and in so doing show that at least one form of anti- representationalism is potentially viable. After giving a teleological definition of representation and applying it to a few models that have inspired anti- representationalist claims, I argue that anti-representationalism must be divided into two distinct theses, one ontological, one epistemological. Given the assumptions that define the debate, I give reason to think that the ontological thesis is false. I then argue that the epistemological thesis might, in the end, turn out to be true, despite a potentially serious difficulty.

Dynamical explanation and mental representations. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 5 (4):141-142. ( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Markman and Dietrich 1 recently recommended extending our understanding of representation to incorporate insights from some âalternativeâ theories of cognition: perceptual symbol systems, situated action, embodied cognition, and dynamical systems. In particular, they suggest that allowances be made for new types of representation which had been previously under-emphasized in cognitive science. The amendments they recommend are based upon the assumption that the alternative positions each agree with the classical view that cognition requires representations, internal mediating states that bear information. 2 In the case of one of the alternatives, dynamical systems 3 , this is simply false: many dynamically-oriented cognitive scientists are anti-representationalists. 4,5,6 Additional links for this entry: http://edisk.fandm.edu/tony.chemero/papers/mand.pdf http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chemero01dynamical.html http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661300016272 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/13646613/2001/00000005/00000004/art01627 Chemero, Anthony Cordeiro, William (online).

Commentary on "the modularity of dynamic systems". ( Google | More links ) Abstract: 1. Throughout the paper, and especially in the section called "LISP vs. DST", I worried that there was not enough focus on EXPLANATION. For the real question, it seems to me, is not whether some dynamical system can implement human cognition, but whether the dynamical description of the system is more explanatorily potent than a computational/representational one. Thus we know, for example, that a purely physical specification can fix a system capable of computing any LISP function. But from this it doesn't follow that the physical description is the one we need to understand the power of the system considered as an information processing device. In the same way, I don't think your demonstration that bifurcating attractor sets can yield the same behavior as a LISP program goes any way towards showing that we should not PREFER the LISP description. To reduce symbolic stories to a subset of DST (as hinted in that section) requires MORE than showing this kind of equivalence: it requires showing that there is explanatory gain, or at the very least, no explanatory loss, at that level. I append an extract from a recent paper of mine that touches on these issues, in case it helps clarify what I am after here Additional links for this entry: http://users.california.com/~mcmf/clark.html Clark, Andy (1998). Time and mind. Journal of Philosophy 95 (7):354-76. ( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Mind, it has recently been argued1, is a thoroughly temporal phenomenon: so temporal, indeed, as to defy description and analysis using the traditional computational tools of cognitive scientific understanding. The proper explanatory tools, so the suggestion goes, are instead the geometric constructs and differential equations of Dynamical Systems Theory. I consider various aspects of the putative temporal challenge to computational understanding, and show that the root problem turns on the presence of a certain kind of causal web: a web that involves multiple components (both inner and outer) linked by chains of continuous and reciprocal causal influence. There is, however, no compelling route from such facts about causal and temporal complexity to the radical anti- computationalist conclusion. This is because, interactive complexities notwithstanding, the computational approach provides a kind of explanatory understanding that cannot (I suggest) be recreated using the alternative resources of pure Dynamical Systems Theory. In particular, it provides a means of mapping information flow onto causal structure -- a mapping that is crucial to understanding the distinctive kinds of flexibility and control characteristic of truly mindful engagements with the world. Where we confront especially complex interactive causal webs, however, it does indeed become harder to isolate the syntactic vehicles required by the computational approach. Dynamical Systems Theory, I conclude, may play a vital role in recovering such vehicles from the burgeoning mass of real-time interactive complexity Additional links for this entry: http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/staff/clark/pubs/time.pdf http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2564539.pdf Cruz, Joe (online).

This new evidence provides a basis for questioning the importance of continuity to cognitive function, challenging a central commitment of dynamicism.

( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Van Gelder (1995) has recently spearheaded a movement to challenge the dominance of connectionist and classicist models in cognitive science. The dynamical conception of cognition is van Gelder's replacement for the computation bound paradigms provided by connectionism and classicism. He relies on the Watt governor to fulfill the role of a dynamicist Turing machine and claims that the Motivational Oscillatory Theory (MOT) provides a sound empirical basis for dynamicism. In other words, the Watt governor is to be the theoretical exemplar of the class of systems necessary for cognition and MOT is an empirical instantiation of that class. However, I shall argue that neither the Watt governor nor MOT successfully fulfill these prescribed roles. This failure, along with van Gelder's peculiar use of the concept of computation and his struggle with representationalism, prevent him from providing a convincing alternative to current cognitive theories Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/325/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000325/ http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000325/ http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=596707.596756 http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/Papers/dynamics.mm.html http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/Papers/dynamics.mm.html http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=316239CI http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:325 http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=316239CI http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:325 http://www.springerlink.com/content/content/u013j75041272360/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/u013j75041272360/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=125137=1 http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=125137=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/U013J75041272360.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/U013J75041272360.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000004/00125137 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1997/00000007/00000004/00125137 http://cogprints.org/325/1/dynamics.mm.html http://cogprints.org/325/0/dynamics.mm.html Eliasmith, Chris (1998).

The third contender: A critical examination of the dynamicist theory of cognition. [Journal (Paginated)] 9 (4):441-63. ( Cited by 79 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In a recent series of publications, dynamicist researchers have proposed a new conception of cognitive functioning. This conception is intended to replace the currently dominant theories of connectionism and symbolicism. The dynamicist approach to cognitive modeling employs concepts developed in the mathematical field of dynamical systems theory. They claim that cognitive models should be embedded, low-dimensional, complex, described by coupled differential equations, and non-representational. In this paper I begin with a short description of the dynamicist project and its role as a cognitive theory. Subsequently, I determine the theoretical commitments of dynamicists, critically examine those commitments and discuss current examples of dynamicist models. In conclusion, I determine dynamicism's relation to symbolicism and connectionism and find that the dynamicist goal to establish a new paradigm has yet to be realized Additional links for this entry: http://cogprints.org/324/0/thirdcontender.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000324/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/03/24/ http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/Papers/thirdcontender.html http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000324/00/thirdcontender.html http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:324 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a793914984~fulltext=713240930 http://cogprints.org/324/1/thirdcontender.html Foss, Jeffrey E.

(1998). Chaotic emergence and the language of thought. Philosophical Psychology 11 (3):303-315. ( Cited by 7 | Google ) Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore the merits of the idea that dynamical systems theory (also known as chaos theory) provides a model of the mind that can vindicate the language of thought (LOT). I investigate the nature of emergent structure in dynamical systems to assess its compatibility with causally efficacious syntactic structure in the brain. I will argue that anyone who is committed to the idea that the brain's functioning depends on emergent features of dynamical systems should have serious reservations about the LOT. First, dynamical systems theory casts doubt on one of the strongest motives for believing in the LOT: principle P, the doctrine that structure found in an effect must also be found in its cause. Second, chaotic emergence is a double-edged sword. Its tendency to cleave the psychological from the neurological undermines foundations for belief in the existence of causally efficacious representations. Overall, a dynamic conception of the brain sways us away from realist conclusions about the causal powers of representations with constituent structure Garson, James W. (1996). Cognition poised at the edge of chaos: A complex alternative to a symbolic mind. Philosophical Psychology 9 (3):301-22. ( Cited by 16 | Google ) Abstract: This paper explores a line of argument against the classical paradigm in cognitive science that is based upon properties of non-linear dynamical systems, especially in their chaotic and near-chaotic behavior. Systems of this kind are capable of generating information-rich macro behavior that could be useful to cognition. I argue that a brain operating at the edge of chaos could generate high-complexity cognition in this way. If this hypothesis is correct, then the symbolic processing methodology in cognitive science faces serious obstacles. A symbolic description of the mind will be extremely difficult, and even if it is achieved to some approximation, there will still be reasons for rejecting the hypothesis that the brain is in fact a symbolic processor Garson, James W. (1997). Syntax in a dynamic brain. Synthese 110 (3):343-55. ( Cited by 8 | Annotation | Google | More links ) There are no good arguments for LOT of the form "The brain needs to do X, and X entails LOT". Considers X = concatenation, logical form, tracking, combinatorial encoding. Either LOT is weakened deeply or is unnecessary.

We generalize this framework: (i) cognitive state transitions, (ii) mathematical/functional design and (iii) physical implementation or realization. Specifying the middle, design level to be the theory of dynamical systems yields a nonclassical, alternative framework that suits (but is not committed to) connectionism. We consider how a brain's (or a network's) being a dynamical system might be the key both to its realizing various essential features of cognition â productivity, systematicity, structure-sensitive processing, syntax â and also to a non-classical solution of (frame-type) problems plaguing classical cognitive science Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/T0T37187T0861785.pdf Horgan, Terence E.

Behavioral systems interpreted as autonomous agents and as coupled dynamical systems: A criticism. Philosophical Psychology 9 (3):323-46. ( Cited by 34 | Google ) Abstract: Cognitive science's basic premises are under attack. In particular, its focus on internal cognitive processes is a target. Intelligence is increasingly interpreted, not as a matter of reclusive thought, but as successful agent-environment interaction. The critics claim that a major reorientation of the field is necessary. However, this will only occur when there is a distinct alternative conceptual framework to replace the old one. Whether or not a serious alternative is provided is not clear. Among the critics there is some consensus, however, that this role could be fulfilled by the concept of a 'behavioral system'. This integrates agent and environment into one encompassing general system. We will discuss two contexts in which the behavioral systems idea is being developed. Autonomous Agents Research is the enterprise of building behavior-based robots. Dynamical Systems Theory provides a mathematical framework well suited for describing the interactions between complex systems. We will conclude that both enterprises provide important contributions to the behavioral systems idea. But neither turns it into a full conceptual alternative which will initiate a major paradigm switch in cognitive science.

The Skillful Body as a Concernful System of Possible Actions: Phenomena and Neurodynamics. Theory & Psychology 18 (3):341-361. ( Google ) Abstract: For Merleau-Ponty,consciousness in skillful coping is a matter of prereflective âI canâ and not explicit âI think that.â The body unifies many domain-specific capacities. There exists a direct link between the perceived possibilities for action in the situation (âaffordancesâ) and the organismâs capacities. From Merleau-Pontyâs descriptions it is clear that in a flow of skillful actions, the leading âI canâ may change from moment to moment without explicit deliberation. How these transitions occur, however, is less clear. Given that Merleau-Ponty suggested that a better understanding of the self-organization of brain and behavior is important, I will re-read his descriptions of skillful coping in the light of recent ideas on neurodynamics. Affective processes play a crucial role in evaluating the motivational significance of objects and contribute to the individualâs prereflective responsiveness to relevant affordances.

I show how attractor basins perform the same explanatory function as modules in several DST based research program. Attractor basins in some organic dynamic systems have even been able to perform cognitive functions which are equivalent to the If/Then/Else loop in the computer language LISP. I suggest directions for future research programs which could find similar equivalencies between organic dynamic systems and other cognitive functions. This type of research could help us discover how (and/or if) it is possible to use Dynamic Systems Theory to more accurately model the cognitive functions that are now being modeled by subroutines in Symbolic AI computer models. If such a reduction of subroutines to basins of attraction is possible, it could free AI from the limitations that prompted Fodor to say that it was impossible to model certain higher level cognitive functions Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/n6h75482x0qvt016/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/N6H75482X0QVT016.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2005/00000015/00000001/00001344 Rockwell, Teed (online). Reply to Clark and Van gelder. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Clark ends his appendix with a description of what he calls "dynamic computationalism", which he describes as an interesting hybrid between DST and GOFAI. My 'horseLISP" example could be described as an example of dynamic computationalism. It is clearly not as eliminativist as Van Gelder's computational governor example, for I am trying to come up with something like identities between computational entities and dynamic ones. Thus unlike other dynamicists, I am not doing what Clark calls "embracing a different vocabulary for the understanding and analysis of brain events". I think we probably can keep much of the computational vocabulary, although the meanings of many of its terms will probably shift as much as the meaning of 'atom' has shifted since Dalton's time. The label of "dynamic computationalism" is perhaps as good a description of my position as any, but I think I would mean something slightly different by it than Clark would.

Colloquia Manilana 6. ( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: To some degree, Fodor's claim that Cognitive science divides the mind into modules tells us more about the minds doing the studying than the mind being studied. The knowledge game is played by analyzing an object of study into parts, and then figuring out how those parts are related to each other. This is the method regardless of whether the object being studied is a mind or a solar system. If a module is just another name for a part, then to say that the mind consists of modules is simply to say that it is comprehensible.

(2005). Cognition and the power of continuous dynamical systems. Minds and Machines 15 (1):57-71. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Traditional approaches to modeling cognitive systems are computational, based on utilizing the standard tools and concepts of the theory of computation. More recently, a number of philosophers have argued that cognition is too subtle or complex for these tools to handle. These philosophers propose an alternative based on dynamical systems theory. Proponents of this view characterize dynamical systems as (i) utilizing continuous rather than discrete mathematics, and, as a result, (ii) being computationally more powerful than traditional computational automata. Indeed, the logical possibility of such super-powerful systems has been demonstrated in the form of analog artificial neural networks. In this paper I consider three arguments against the nomological possibility of these automata. While the first two arguments fail, the third succeeds. In particular, the presence of noise reduces the computational power of analog networks to that of traditional computational automata, and noise is a pervasive feature of information processing in biological systems. Consequently, as an empirical thesis, the proposed dynamical alternative is under-motivated: What is required is an account of how continuously valued systems could be realized in physical systems despite the ubiquity of noise Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/xtx321861761117r/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/XTX321861761117R.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2005/00000015/00000001/00001345 Sloman, Aaron (1993).

In place of traditional computational models, I argue that research inspired by Dynamical Systems theory can support an alternative view of representations. My suggestion is that we treat linguistic and representational structures as providing complex multi-dimensional targets for the development of individual brains. This approach acknowledges the indispensability of the intentional or representational idiom in psychological explanation without locating representations in the brains of intelligent agents Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/u55n058l05q58r53/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=352659=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/U55N058L05Q58R53.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2001/00000011/00000004/00352659 Treur, Jan (2005). States of change: Explaining dynamics by anticipatory state properties. Philosophical Psychology 18 (4):441-471. ( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In cognitive science, the dynamical systems theory (DST) has recently been advocated as an approach to cognitive modeling that is better suited to the dynamics of cognitive processes than the symbolic/computational approaches are. Often, the differences between DST and the symbolic/computational approach are emphasized. However, alternatively their commonalities can be analyzed and a unifying framework can be sought. In this paper, the possibility of such a unifying perspective on dynamics is analyzed. The analysis covers dynamics in cognitive disciplines, as well as in physics, mathematics and computer science. The unifying perspective warrants the development of integrated approaches covering both DST aspects and symbolic/computational aspects. The concept of a state-determined system, which is based on the assumption that properties of a given state fully determine the properties of future states, lies at the heart of DST. Taking this assumption as a premise, the explanatory problem of dynamics is analyzed in more detail. The analysis of four cases within different disciplines (cognitive science, physics, mathematics, computer science) shows how in history this perspective led to numerous often used concepts within them. In cognitive science, the concepts desire and intention were introduced, and in classical mechanics the concepts momentum, energy and force. Similarly, in mathematics a number of concepts have been developed to formalize the state-determined system assumption [e.g. derivatives (of different orders) of a function, Taylor approximations]. Furthermore, transition systems - a currently popular format for specification of dynamical systems within computer science - can also be interpreted from this perspective. One of the main contributions of the paper is that the case studies provide a unified view on the explanation of dynamics across the chosen disciplines. All approaches to dynamics analyzed in this paper share the state-determined system assumption and the (explicit or implicit) use of anticipatory state properties. Within cognitive science, realism is one of the problems identified for the symbolic/computational approach - i.e. how do internal states described by symbols relate to the real world in a natural manner. As DST is proposed as an alternative to the symbolic/computational approach, a natural question is whether, for DST, realism of the states can be better guaranteed. As a second main contribution, the paper provides an evaluation of DST compared to the symbolic/computational approach, which shows that, in this respect (i.e. for the realism problem), DST does not provide a better solution than the other approaches. This shows that DST and the symbolic/computational approach not only have the state-determined system assumption and the use of anticipatory state properties in common, but also the realism problem Additional links for this entry: http://www.few.vu.nl/~wai/Papers/PP04soc.pdf http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wai/Papers/PP04socprel.pdf http://www.phil.uu.nl/preprints/ckipreprints/PREPRINTS/preprint051.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~content=a723861123~fulltext=713240930 http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/HU51317GJ73622Q1.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/723861123.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2005/00000018/00000004/art00003 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a723861123~fulltext=713240930 van Gelder, Tim (1997).

Singapore: World Scientific. ( Cited by 16 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Cognitive science has always been dominated by the idea that cognition is _computational _in a rather strong and clear sense. Within the mainstream approach, cognitive agents are taken to be what are variously known as _physical symbol_ _systems, digital computers_, _syntactic engines_, or_ symbol manipulators_. Cognitive operations are taken to consist in the shuffling of symbol tokens according to strict rules (programs). Models of cognition are themselves digital computers, implemented on general purpose electronic machines. The basic mathematical framework for understanding cognition is the theory of discrete computation, and the core theoretical tools for developing and understanding models of cognition are those of computer science Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/292698.html http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/vangelder98defending.html http://depts.washington.edu/edtech/VanGelder_revisiting.pdf http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=0xdkpD2AVxZ3VXmohG8YuqJieNg van Gelder, Tim Port, Robert (eds.)

The main points to be addressed involve the reductive tendencies inherent in Dynamical Systems Theory, its somewhat muddled position relative to connectionism, the metaphorical nature DST-C exhibits which hinders its explanatory potential, and DST-C's problematic account of causality. Brief discussions of the mathematical and philosophical backgrounds of DST, seminal experimental work and possible adaptations of the theory or alternative suggestions (dynamicist connectionism, neurophenomenology, R theory) are included van Gelder, Tim (1999).

I present two possible interpretations of the dynamicists' argument from time and show that neither one is successful. The disagreement between dynamicists and symbolic theorists rests not on temporal considerations per se, but on differences over the multiple realizability of cognitive states and the proper explanatory goals of psychology. The negative arguments of dynamicists against symbolic models fail, and it is doubtful whether pursuing dynamicists' explanatory goals will lead to a robust psychological theory.

Husserl's theory of belief and the heideggerean critique. Husserl Studies 25 (2). ( Google ) Abstract: I develop a âtwo-systemsâ interpretation of Husserlâs theory of belief. On this interpretation, Husserl accounts for our sense of the world in terms of (1) a system of embodied horizon meanings and passive synthesis, which is involved in any experience of an object, and (2) a system of active synthesis and sedimentation, which comes on line when we attend to an objectâs properties. I use this account to defend Husserl against several forms of Heideggerean critique. One line of critique, recently elaborated by Taylor Carman, says that Husserl wrongly loads everyday perception with explicit beliefs about things. A second, earlier line of critique, due to Hubert Dreyfus, charges Husserl with thinking of belief on a problematic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model which involves explicit rules applied to discrete symbol structures. I argue that these criticisms are based on a conflation of Husserlâs two systems of belief. The conception of Husserlian phenomenology which emerges is compatible with Heideggerean phenomenology and associated approaches to cognitive science (in particular, dynamical systems theory) Yoshimi, Jeffrey (2007). Mathematizing phenomenology. Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences 6 (3). ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Husserl is well known for his critique of the âmathematizing tendenciesâ of modern science, and is particularly emphatic that mathematics and phenomenology are distinct and in some sense incompatible. But Husserl himself uses mathematical methods in phenomenology. In the first half of the paper I give a detailed analysis of this tension, showing how those Husserlian doctrines which seem to speak against application of mathematics to phenomenology do not in fact do so. In the second half of the paper I focus on a particular example of Husserlâs âmathematized phenomenologyâ: his use of concepts from what is today called dynamical systems theory Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/A22585111621Q121.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/phen/2007/00000006/00000003/00009052 6.4e The Nature of AI Buchanan, Bruce G.

Abstract: It has been claimed that a great deal of AI research is an attempt to discover the empirical laws describing a new type of entity in the worldâthe artificial computing system.

Bruce Buchanan, among others, conceives of medium AI as an empirical science entirely on a par with psychology or chemistry. I argue that medium AI is not an empirical science at all.

It is impossible, in principle, to process complex information as a whole. We need some partial processing strategy that is still somehow connected to the whole. We also need flexible processing that can adapt to changes in the environment. One of the candidates for both of these is situated reasoning, which makes use of the fact that an agent is in a situation, so it only processes some of the information â the part that is relevant to that situation. The combination of situated reasoning and context reflection leads to the idea of organic programming, which introduces a new building block of programs called a cell.

A different theory asserts that color sensation is located in a small subpart of the visual cortex called V4. If these theories are correct, or even approximately correct, then they are remarkable advances toward a scientific explanation of human conscious experience. Yet even understanding the claims of such theoriesâmuch less evaluating themâraises some puzzles. Conscious experience does not present itself as a brain process. Indeed experience seems entirely unlike neural activity. For example, to some people it seems that an exact physical duplicate of you could have different sensations than you do, or could have no sensations at all. If so, then how is it even possible that sensations could turn out to be brain processes?

( Google ) Abstract: While we agree that the frame problem, as initially stated by McCarthy and Hayes (1969), is a problem that arises because of the use of representations, we do not accept the anti-representationalist position that the way around the problem is to eliminate representations. We believe that internal representations of the external world are a necessary, perhaps even a defining feature, of higher cognition. We explore the notion of dynamically created context-dependent representations that emerge from a continual interaction between working memory, external input, and long-term memory. We claim that only this kind of representation, necessary for higher cognitive abilities such as counterfactualization, will allow the combinatorial explosion inherent in the frame problem to be avoided Clark, Andy (2002).

At a more general level, the trick is to use this second-order link-structure information to rapidly and cheaply identify the knowledge- structures most likely to be relevant given a specific input. I shall argue that Kleinbergâs procedure is suggestive of a new, viable, and neuroscientifically plausible solution to at least (one incarnation of) the so-called âFrame Problemâ in cognitive science viz the problem of explaining global abductive inference.

The frame problem arises in the context of modelling the human ability to see the relevant consequences of events in a situation. It has been claimed to be unsolvable for classical cognitive science, but easily manageable for connectionism. We will focus on a representational approach to the frame problem which advocates the use of intrinsic representations. We argue that although connectionism's distributed representations may look promising from this perspective, doubts can be raised about the potential of distributed representations to allow large amounts of complexly structured information to be adequately encoded and processed. It is questionable whether connectionist models that are claimed to effectively represent structured information can be scaled up to a realistic extent. We conclude that the frame problem provides a difficulty to connectionism that is no less serious than the obstacle it constitutes for classical cognitive science Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=371129CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/um0x474450532866/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=150466=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/UM0X474450532866.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1998/00000008/00000002/00150466 Haugeland, John (1987).

What does the frame problem tell us about moral normativity? Ethical Theory and Moral Practice 12 (1). ( Google ) Abstract: Within cognitive science, mental processing is often construed as computation over mental representationsâi.e., as the manipulation and transformation of mental representations in accordance with rules of the kind expressible in the form of a computer program. This foundational approach has encountered a long-standing, persistently recalcitrant, problem often called the frame problem; it is sometimes called the relevance problem. In this paper we describe the frame problem and certain of its apparent morals concerning human cognition, and we argue that these morals have significant import regarding both the nature of moral normativity and the human capacity for mastering moral normativity. The morals of the frame problem bode well, we argue, for the claim that moral normativity is not fully systematizable by exceptionless general principles, and for the correlative claim that such systematizability is not required in order for humans to master moral normativity Janlert, Lars-Erik (1987).

I dispute the claim that extensions to logic (default logic and circumscriptive logic) will ever offer a viable way out of the problem. In the discussion it will become clear that the original frame problem is really a fairy tale: as originally presented, and as tools for its solution are circumscribed by Pat Hayes, the problem is entertaining, but incapable of resolution. The solution to the frame problem becomes available, and even apparent, when we remove artificial restrictions on its treatment and understand the interrelation between the frame problem and the many other problems for artificial epistemology. I present the solution to the frame problem: an adequate theory and method for the machine induction of causal structure. Whereas this solution is clearly satisfactory in principle, and in practice real progress has been made in recent years in its application, its ultimate implementation is in prospect only for future generations of AI researchers Additional links for this entry: http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=381462CI http://www.springerlink.com/content/q30166435n81x313/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=168538=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/Q30166435N81X313.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/1998/00000008/00000003/00168538 Lormand, Eric (1990).

Abstract: Â Â The frame problem is widely reputed among philosophers to be one of the deepest and most difficult problems of cognitive science. This paper discusses three recent attempts to display this problem: Dennett's problem of ignoring obviously irrelevant knowledge, Haugeland's problem of efficiently keeping track of salient side effects, and Fodor's problem of avoiding the use of kooky concepts. In a negative vein, it is argued that these problems bear nothing but a superficial similarity to the frame problem of AI, so that they do not provide reasons to disparage standard attempts to solve it. More positively, it is argued that these problems are easily solved by slight variations on familiar AI themes. Finally, some discussion is devoted to more difficult problems confronting AI Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/R122137P20775140.pdf Lormand, Eric (1998).

( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Much research in AI (and cognitive science, more broadly) proceeds on the assumption that there is a difference between being well-informed and being smart. Being well-informed has to do, roughly, with the content of oneâs representations--with their truth and the range of subjects they cover. Being smart, on the other hand, has to do with oneâs ability to process these representations and with packaging them in a form that allows them to be processed efficiently. The main theoretical concern of artificial intelligence research is to solve "process-and-form" problems: problems with finding processes and representational formats that enable us to understand how a computer could be smart Additional links for this entry: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/phil/cogsci/holorobophobe.htm http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=hkiEKXzQKsG9Gm3nxwiIFbbaoPw Maloney, J.

(Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: For many of the authors in this volume, this is the second attempt to explore what McCarthy and Hayes (1969) ï¬rst called the âFrame Problemâ. Since the ï¬rst compendium (Pylyshyn, 1987), nicely summarized here by Ronald Loui, there have been several conferences and books on the topic. Their goals range from providing a clariï¬cation of the problem by breaking it down into subproblems (and sometimes declaring the hard subproblems to not be the_ real_ Frame Problem), to providing formal âsolutionsâ to certain aspects of the problem. But more often the message has been that the problem is not solvable except in a piecemeal way in special circumstances by some sort of heuristic approximations. It has sometimes also been said that solving the Frame Problem is not only an unachievable goal, but it is also an unnecessary one since_ humans_ do not solve it either; we simply get along as best we can and deal with the problem of planning in ways that, to use Dennettâs phrase, is âgood enough for government workâ Additional links for this entry: http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/frame.pdf http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=279932.279934 Pylyshyn, Zenon W.

( Cited by 1 | Google ) Abstract: We humans often respond effectively when faced with novel circumstances. This is because we are able to predict how particular alterations to the world will play out. Philosophers, psychologists, and computational modelers have long favored an account of this process that takes its inspiration from the truth-preserving powers of formal deduction techniques. There is, however, an alternative hypothesis that is better able to account for the human capacity to predict the consequences worldly alterations. This alternative takes its inspiration from the powers of truth preservation exhibited by scale models and leads to a determinate computational solution to the frame problem Wheeler, Michael (2008). Cognition in context: Phenomenology, situated robotics and the frame problem. International Journal of Philosophical Studies 16 (3):323 349. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: The frame problem is the difficulty of explaining how non-magical systems think and act in ways that are adaptively sensitive to context-dependent relevance. Influenced centrally by Heideggerian phenomenology, Hubert Dreyfus has argued that the frame problem is, in part, a consequence of the assumption (made by mainstream cognitive science and artificial intelligence) that intelligent behaviour is representation-guided behaviour. Dreyfus' Heideggerian analysis suggests that the frame problem dissolves if we reject representationalism about intelligence and recognize that human agents realize the property of thrownness (the property of being always already embedded in a context). I argue that this positive proposal is incomplete until we understand exactly how the properties in question may be instantiated in machines like us. So, working within a broadly Heideggerian conceptual framework, I pursue the character of a representation-shunning thrown machine. As part of this analysis, I suggest that the frame problem is, in truth, a two-headed beast. The intra-context frame problem challenges us to say how a purely mechanistic system may achieve appropriate, flexible and fluid action within a context. The inter-context frame problem challenges us to say how a purely mechanistic system may achieve appropriate, flexible and fluid action in worlds in which adaptation to new contexts is open-ended and in which the number of potential contexts is indeterminate. Drawing on the field of situated robotics, I suggest that the intra-context frame problem may be neutralized by systems of special-purpose adaptive couplings, while the inter-context frame problem may be neutralized by systems that exhibit the phenomenon of continuous reciprocal causation. I also defend the view that while continuous reciprocal causation is in conflict with representational explanation, special-purpose adaptive coupling, as well as its associated agential phenomenology, may feature representations. My proposal has been criticized recently by Dreyfus, who accuses me of propagating a cognitivist misreading of Heidegger, one that, because it maintains a role for representation, leads me seriously astray in my handling of the frame problem. I close by responding to Dreyfus' concerns Additional links for this entry: http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a794481656~fulltext=713240930 Wilkerson, William S. (2001). Simulation, theory, and the frame problem: The interpretive moment. Philosophical Psychology 14 (2):141-153. ( Cited by 5 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The theory-theory claims that the explanation and prediction of behavior works via the application of a theory, while the simulation theory claims that explanation works by putting ourselves in others' places and noting what we would do. On either account, in order to develop a prediction or explanation of another person's behavior, one first needs to have a characterization of that person's current or recent actions. Simulation requires that I have some grasp of the other person's behavior to project myself upon; whereas theorizing requires a subject matter to theorize about. The frame problem shows that multiple, true characterizations are possible for any behavior or situation. However, only one or a few of these characterizations are relevant to explaining or predicting behavior. Since different characterizations of a behavior lead to different predictions or explanations, much of the work of interpersonal interpretation is done in the process of finding this characterization - that is, prior to either theorizing or simulating. Moreover, finding this characterization involves extensive knowledge of the physical, cultural, and social worlds of the persons involved Additional links for this entry: http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/2C8FMEEMEUG504KF.pdf http://www.informaworld.com/index/2C8FMEEMEUG504KF.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cphp/2001/00000014/00000002/art00001 http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/./ftinterface~db=all~content=a713690495~fulltext=713240930 6.4g AI Methodology Bickhard, Mark H.

These turn out not to be autonomous subsystems, but, instead, are deeply integrated in the basic interactive dynamic character of living systems. Motivation is a crucial aspect of particular kinds of interactive systems -- systems for which representation is a sister aspect. Emotion is a special kind of partially reflective interaction process, and yields its own emergent motivational aspects. In addition, the overall model accounts for some of the crucial properties of consciousness Additional links for this entry: http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/motemotion.html http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/MotandEmotion.pdf Birnbaum, L.

( Cited by 1 | Annotation | Google ) AI must integrate perception and cognition in the interest of flexible representation. Current models ignore perception and the development of representation, but this cannot be separated from later cognitive processes. Chalmers, David J. ; French, Robert M. Hofstadter, Douglas R. (1992). High-level perception, representation, and analogy:A critique of artificial intelligence methodology. Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intellige 4 (3):185 - 211. ( Cited by 123 | Google | More links ) Abstract: High-level perception--âthe process of making sense of complex data at an abstract, conceptual level--âis fundamental to human cognition. Through high-level perception, chaotic environmen- tal stimuli are organized into the mental representations that are used throughout cognitive pro- cessing. Much work in traditional artificial intelligence has ignored the process of high-level perception, by starting with hand-coded representations. In this paper, we argue that this dis- missal of perceptual processes leads to distorted models of human cognition. We examine some existing artificial-intelligence models--ânotably BACON, a model of scientific discovery, and the Structure-Mapping Engine, a model of analogical thought--âand argue that these are flawed pre- cisely because they downplay the role of high-level perception. Further, we argue that perceptu- al processes cannot be separated from other cognitive processes even in principle, and therefore that traditional artificial-intelligence models cannot be defended by supposing the existence of a --Årepresentation module--ï¿½ that supplies representations ready-made. Finally, we describe a model of high-level perception and analogical thought in which perceptual processing is integrated with analogical mapping, leading to the flexible build-up of representations appropriate to a given context Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/49715.html http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=175346.175347 http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/highlevel.pdf http://www.nbu.bg/cogs/personal/kokinov/COG501/hightlevel.pdf http://www.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs=2767459CI http://www.informaworld.com/index/778787585.pdf Clark, Andy (1986).

The feeling body: Towards an enactive approach to emotion. In W. F. Overton, U. Mueller J. Newman (eds.), Body in Mind, Mind in Body: Developmental Perspectives on Embodiment and Consciousness . Erlbaum. ( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: For many years emotion theory has been characterized by a dichotomy between the head and the body. In the golden years of cognitivism, during the nineteen-sixties and seventies, emotion theory focused on the cognitive antecedents of emotion, the so-called âappraisal processes.â Bodily events were seen largely as byproducts of cognition, and as too unspecific to contribute to the variety of emotion experience. Cognition was conceptualized as an abstract, intellectual, âheadyâ process separate from bodily events. Although current emotion theory has moved beyond this disembodied stance by conceiving of emotions as involving both cognitive processes (perception, attention, and evaluation) and bodily events (arousal, behavior, and facial expressions), the legacy of cognitivism persists in the tendency to treat cognitive and bodily events as separate constituents of emotion. Thus the cognitive aspects of emotion are supposedly distinct and separate from the bodily ones. This separation indicates that cognitivismâs disembodied conception of cognition continues to shape the way emotion theorists conceptualize emotion Additional links for this entry: http://individual.utoronto.ca/evant/FeelingBody.pdf http://people.exeter.ac.uk/gc243/index/GC_FeelingBody.pdf http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_FeelingBody.pdf Dascal, M.

It should be concerned, therefore, withpragmatics. But its concern with pragmatics should not be restricted to the narrow, traditional conception of pragmatics as the theory of communication (or of the social uses of language). In addition to that, AI should take into account also the mental uses of language (in reasoning, for example) and the existential dimensions of language as a determiner of the world we (and our computers) live in. In this paper, the relevance of these three branches of pragmatics-sociopragmatics, psychopragmatics, and ontopragmatics-for AI are explored Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/w371m4055304hp68/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/W371M4055304HP68.pdf Dietrich, Eric (1994).

Journal of Experimental And Theoretical Artificial Intelligence 6 (4):325-330. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Concern over the nature of AI is, for the tastes many AI scientists, probably overdone. In this they are like all other scientists. Working scientists worry about experiments, data, and theories, not foundational issues such as what their work is really about or whether their discipline is methodologically healthy. However, most scientists arenât in a field that is approximately fifty years old. Even relatively new fields such as nonlinear dynamics or branches of biochemistry are in fact advances in older established sciences and are therefore much more settled. Of course, by stretching things, AI can be said to have a history reaching back t o Charles Babbage, and possibly back beyond that to Leibnitz. However, all of that is best viewed as prelude. AIâs history is punctuated with the invention of the computer (and, if one wants t o stretch our history back to the 1930s, the development of the notion of computation by Turing, Church, and others). Hence, AI really began (or began in earnest) sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s (some mark the conference a t Dartmouth in the summer of 1957 as the moment of our birth). And since those years we simply have not had time to settle into a routine science attacking reasonably well understood questions (for example, many of the questions some of us regard as supreme are regarded by others as inconsequential or mere excursions) Additional links for this entry: http://www.informaworld.com/index/777915170.pdf Dreyfus, Hubert L.

( Cited by 2 | Annotation | Google | More links ) Various AI approaches to belief: syntactic, propositional/meaning-based, information, tractability, discoverability, and degree of confidence. Abstract: Â Â Within AI and the cognitively related disciplines, there exist a multiplicity of uses of belief. On the face of it, these differing uses reflect differing views about the nature of an objective phenomenon called belief. In this paper I distinguish six distinct ways in which belief is used in AI. I shall argue that not all these uses reflect a difference of opinion about an objective feature of reality. Rather, in some cases, the differing uses reflect differing concerns with special AI applications. In other cases, however, genuine differences exist about the nature of what we pre-theoretically call belief. To an extent the multiplicity of opinions about, and uses of belief, echoes the discrepant motivations of AI researchers. The relevance of this discussion for cognitive scientists and philosophers arises from the fact that (a) many regard theoretical research within AI as a branch of cognitive science, and (b) even if theoretical AI is not cognitive science, trends within AI influence theories developed within cognitive science. It should be beneficial, therefore, to unravel the distinct uses and motivations surrounding belief, in order to discover which usages merely reflect differing pragmatic concerns, and which usages genuinely reflect divergent views about reality Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/qm781236u5642248/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/QM781236U5642248.pdf Haugeland, John (1979).

Abstract: The objective of research in the foundations of Al is to explore such basic questions as: What is a theory in Al? What are the most abstract assumptions underlying the competing visions of intelligence? What are the basic arguments for and against each assumption? In this essay I discuss five foundational issues: (1) Core Al is the study of conceptualization and should begin with knowledge level theories. (2) Cognition can be studied as a disembodied process without solving the symbol grounding problem. (3) Cognition is nicely described in propositional terms. (4) We can study cognition separately from learning. (5) There is a single architecture underlying virtually all cognition. I explain what each of these implies and present arguments from both outside and inside Al why each has been seen as right or wrong.

( Google ) Abstract: The ontology of decision theory has been subject to considerable debate in the past, and discussion of just how we ought to view decision problems has revealed more than one interesting problem, as well as suggested some novel modifications of classical decision theory. In this paper it will be argued that Bayesian, or evidential, decision-theoretic characterizations of decision situations fail to adequately account for knowledge concerning the causal connections between acts, states, and outcomes in decision situations, and so they are incomplete. Second, it will be argues that when we attempt to incorporate the knowledge of such causal connections into Bayesian decision theory, a substantial technical problem arises for which there is no currently available solution that does not suffer from some damning objection or other. From a broader perspective, this then throws into question the use of decision theory as a model of human or machine planning Sticklen, J. (1989).

( Google ) Abstract: The mid-twentieth century saw the introduction of a new general model of processes, COMPUTATION, with the work of scientists such as Turing, Chomsky, Newell and Simon.1 This model so revolutionized the intellectual world that the dominant scientific programs of the dayâspearheaded by such eminent scientists as Hilbert, Bloomfield and Skinnerâare today remembered as much for the way computation exposed their stark limitations as for their positive contributions.2 Ever since, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has defined itself as the subfield of computer science dedicated to the understanding of intelligent entities as computational processes.

( Google ) Abstract: In this paper, I examine a variety of agents that appear in Kantian ethics in order to determine which would be necessary to make a robot a genuine moral agent. However, building such an agent would require that we structure into a robotâs behavioral repertoire the possibility for immoral behavior, for only then can the moral law, according to Kant, manifest itself as an ought, a prerequisite for being able to hold an agent morally accountable for its actions. Since building a moral robot requires the possibility of immoral behavior, I go on to argue that we cannot morally want robots to be genuine moral agents, but only beings that simulate moral behavior. Finally, I raise but do not answer the question that if morality requires us to want robots that are not genuine moral agents, why should we want something different in the case of human beings Breazeal, C.

We are building an integrated physical system including vision, sound input and output, and dextrous manipulation, all controlled by a continuously operating large scale parallel MIMD computer. The resulting system will learn to "think" by building on its bodily experiences to accomplish progressively more abstract tasks. Past experience suggests that in attempting to build such an integrated system we will have to fundamentally change the way artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy think about the organization of intelligence.

( Cited by 302 | Google | More links ) Abstract: To explore issues of developmental structure, physical em- bodiment, integration of multiple sensory and motor systems, and social interaction, we have constructed an upper-torso humanoid robot called Cog. The robot has twenty-one degrees of freedom and a variety of sen- sory systems, including visual, auditory, vestibular, kinesthetic, and tac- tile senses. This chapter gives a background on the methodology that we have used in our investigations, highlights the research issues that have been raised during this project, and provides a summary of both the current state of the project and our long-term goals. We report on a variety of implemented visual-motor routines (smooth-pursuit track- ing, saccades, binocular vergence, and vestibular-ocular and opto-kinetic re?exes), orientation behaviors, motor control techniques, and social be- haviors (pointing to a visual target, recognizing joint attention through face and eye ?nding, imitation of head nods, and regulating interaction through expressive feedback).

( Cited by 73 | Google | More links ) Abstract: There is a definite challenge in the air regarding the pivotal notion of internal representation. This challenge is explicit in, e.g., van Gelder, 1995; Beer, 1995; Thelen & Smith, 1994; Wheeler, 1994; and elsewhere. We think it is a challenge that can be met and that (importantly) can be met by arguing from within a general framework that accepts many of the basic premises of the work (in new robotics and in dynamical systems theory) that motivates such scepticism in the first place. Our strategy will be as follows. We begin (Section 1) by offering an account (an example and something close to a definition) of what we shall term Minimal Robust Representationalism (MRR). Sections 2 & 3 address some likely worries and questions about this notion. We end (Section 4) by making explicit the conditions under which, on our account, a science (e.g., robot- ics) may claim to be addressing cognitive phenomena Additional links for this entry: http://www.isab.org/journal/adap7_1.php http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=312918 http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/cogrob/cogrob.pdf https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1297 http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/cogrob/cogrob.pdf http://www.denizyuret.com/ref/clark_andy/cogrob.ps http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/andy/tacrfinalw-Grush.pdf http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/andy/tacrfinalw-Grush.pdf http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/cogrob/cogrobhtml/cogrob-text.html http://mind.ucsd.edu/papers/cogrob/cogrobhtml/cogrob-text.html http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/staff/clark/pubs/tacrfinalw-Grush.pdf http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/staff/clark/pubs/tacrfinalw-Grush.pdf http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/clark (1999) towards a cognitive robotics.pdf http://adb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/1/5 Dautenhahn, Kerstin ; Ogden, Bernard ; Quick, Tom Ziemke, Tom (2002).

(ms). Cog as a thought experiment. ( Cited by 3 | Google | More links ) Abstract: In her presentation at the Monte VeritÃ  workshop, Maja Mataric showed us a videotape of her robots cruising together through the lab, and remarked, aptly: "They're flocking, but that's not what they think they're doing." This is a vivid instance of a phenomenon that lies at the heart of all the research I learned about at Monte VeritÃ : the execution of surprisingly successful "cognitive" behaviors by systems that did not explicitly represent, and did not need to explicitly represent, what they were doing. How "high" in the intuitive scale of cognitive sophistication can such unwitting prowess reach? All the way, apparently, since I want to echo Maja's observation with one of my own: "These roboticists are doing philosophy, but that's not what they think they're doing." It is possible, then, even to do philosophy--that most intellectual of activities--without realizing that that is what you are doing. It is even possible to do it well, for this is a good, new way of addressing antique philosophical puzzles Additional links for this entry: http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/cogthogt.htm http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00000248/ http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/documents/disk0/00/00/02/48/ http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/citations?archiveID=oai:cogprints.soton.ac.uk:248 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/09218890/1997/00000020/00000002/art80709 http://cogprints.org/248/1/cogthogt.htm http://cogprints.org/248/0/cogthogt.htm Dennett, Daniel C.

(2007). The inner world of a simple robot. Journal of Consciousness Studies 14 (7):85-96. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to discuss whether a particular robot can be said to have an 'inner world', something that can be taken to be a critical feature of consciousness. It has previously been argued that the mechanism underlying the appearance of an inner world in humans is an ability of our brains to simulate behaviour and perception. A robot has previously been designed in which perception can be simulated. A prima facie case can be made that this robot has an inner world in the same sense as humans. Various objections to this claim are discussed in the paper and it is concluded that the robot, although extremely simple, can easily be improved without adding any new principles, so that ascribing an inner world to it becomes intuitively reasonable Additional links for this entry: http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000007/art00006 Holland, Owen Goodman, Russell B.

( Cited by 1 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â A situated agent is one which operates within an environment. In most cases, the environment in which the agent exists will be more complex than the agent itself. This means that an agent, human or artificial, which wishes to carry out non-trivial operations in its environment must use techniques which allow an unbounded world to be represented within a cognitively bounded agent. We present a brief description of some important theories within the fields of epistemology and metaphysics. We then discuss ways in which philosophical problems of scepticism are related to the problems faced by knowledge representation. We suggest that some of the methods that philosophers have developed to address the problems of epistemology may be relevant to the problems of representing knowledge within artificial agents Additional links for this entry: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=781081.781090 http://www.springerlink.com/content/g6g408r7457k4u21/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5118862=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/G6G408R7457K4U21.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2003/00000013/00000003/05118862 Menant, Christophe (2005). Information and meaning in life, humans and robots (2005). Proceedings of FIS2005 by MDPI, Basel, Switzerland . ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Information and meaning exist around us and within ourselves, and the same information can correspond to different meanings. This is true for humans and animals, and is becoming true for robots. We propose here an overview of this subject by using a systemic tool related to meaning generation that has already been published (C. Menant, Entropy 2003). The Meaning Generator System (MGS) is a system submitted to a constraint that generates a meaningful information when it receives an incident information that has a relation with the constraint. The content of the meaningful information is explicited, and its function is to trigger an action that will be used to satisfy the constraint of the system. The MGS has been introduced in the case of basic life submitted to a stay alive constraint. We propose here to see how the usage of the MGS can be extended to more complex living systems, to humans and to robots by introducing new types of constraints, and integrating the MGS into higher level systems. The application of the MGS to humans is partly based on a scenario relative to the evolution of body self-awareness toward self-consciousness that has already been presented (C. Menant, Biosemiotics 2003, and TSC 2004). The application of the MGS to robots is based on the definition of the MGS applied to robots functionality, taking into account the origins of the constraints. We conclude with a summary of this overview and with themes that can be linked to this systemic approach on meaning generation Additional links for this entry: http://www.mdpi.org/fis2005/F.45.paper.pdf http://www.mdpi.net/fis2005/F.45.paper.pdf http://cogprints.org/4531/1/F.45.paper.pdf Minsky, Marvin L.

Nevertheless, our health often gives out before we achieve them. To lengthen our lives, and improve our minds, in the future we will need to change our our bodies and brains. To that end, we first must consider how normal Darwinian evolution brought us to where we are. Then we must imagine ways in which future replacements for worn body parts might solve most problems of failing health. We must then invent strategies to augment our brains and gain greater wisdom. Eventually we will entirely replace our brains -- using nanotechnology. Once delivered from the limitations of biology, we will be able to decide the length of our lives--with the option of immortality-- and choose among other, unimagined capabilities as well Additional links for this entry: http://www.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/sciam.inherit.txt http://www.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/sciam.inherit.html http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/sciam.inherit.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve=Citation Moravec, Hans (online). Bodies, robots, minds. ( Google ) Abstract: Serious attempts to build thinking machines began after the second world war. One line of research, called Cybernetics, used electronic circuitry imitating nervous systems to make machines that learned to recognize simple patterns, and turtle-like robots that found their way to recharging plugs. A different approach, named Artificial Intelligence, harnessed the arithmetic power of post-war computers to abstract reasoning, and by the 1960s made computers prove theorems in logic and geometry, solve calculus problems and play good games of checkers. At the end of the 1960s, research groups at MIT and Stanford attached television cameras and robot arms to their computers, so "thinking" programs could begin to collect information directly from the real world Moravec, Hans (online). Robotics. Encyclopaedia Britannica Online . ( Google ) Abstract: the development of machines with motor, perceptual and cognitive skills once found only in animals and humans. The field parallels and has adopted developments from several areas, among them mechanization, automation and artificial intelligence, but adds its own gripping myth, of complete artificial mechanical human beings. Ancient images and figurines depicting animals and humans can be interpreted as steps towards this vision, as can mechanical automata from classical times on. The pace accelerated rapidly in the twentieth century with the development of electronic sensing and amplification that permitted automata to sense and react as well as merely perform. By the late twentieth century automata controlled by computers could also think and remember Moravec, Hans (online). Robots inherit human minds. ( Google ) Abstract: Our first tools, sticks and stones, were very different from ourselves. But many tools now resemble us, in function or form, and they are beginning to have minds. A loose parallel with our own evolution suggests how they may develop in future. Computerless industrial machinery exhibits the behavioral flexibility of single-celled organisms. Today's best computer-controlled robots are like the simpler invertebrates. A thousand-fold increase in computer power in this decade should make possible machines with reptile-like sensory and motor competence. Growing computer power over the next half century will allow robots that learn like mammals, model their world like primates and eventually reason like humans. Depending on your point of view, humanity will then have produced a worthy successor, or transcended inherited limitations and transformed itself into something quite new. No longer limited by the slow pace of human learning and even slower biological evolution, intelligent machinery will conduct its affairs on an ever faster, ever smaller scale, until coarse physical nature has been converted to fine-grained purposeful thought Moravec, Hans (1994).

(1995). Computationalism and the problem of other minds. Philosophical Psychology 8 (4):375-88. ( Google ) Abstract: In this paper I discuss Searle's claim that the computational properties of a system could never cause a system to be conscious. In the first section of the paper I argue that Searle is correct that, even if a system both behaves in a way that is characteristic of conscious agents (like ourselves) and has a computational structure similar to those agents, one cannot be certain that that system is conscious. On the other hand, I suggest that Searle's intuition that it is âempirically absurdâ that such a system could be conscious is unfounded. In the second section I show that Searle's attempt to show that a system's computational states could not possibly cause it to be conscious is based upon an erroneous distinction between computational and physical properties. On the basis of these two arguments, I conclude that, supposing that the behavior of conscious agents can be explained in terms of their computational properties, we have good reason to suppose that a system having computational properties similar to such agents is also conscious Hauser, Larry (2000).

Minds and Machines 19 (4):495-506. ( Google ) Abstract: Computationalism, a specie of functionalism, posits that a mental state like pain is realized by a âcoreâ computational state within a particular causal network of such states. This entails that what is realized by the core state is contingent on events remote in space and time, which puts computationalism at odds with the locality principle of physics. If computationalism is amended to respect locality, then it posits that a type of phenomenal experience is determined by a single type of computational state. But a computational state, considered by itself, is of no determinate typeâit has no particular symbolic content, since it could be embedded in any of an infinite number of algorithms. Hence, if locality is respected, then the type of experience that is realized by a computational state, or whether any experience at all is realized, is under-determined by the computational nature of the state. Accordingly, Blockâs absent and inverted qualia arguments against functionalism find support in the locality principle of physics. If computationalism denies locality to avoid this problem, then it cannot be considered a physicalist theory since it would entail a commitment to phenomena, like teleological causation and action-at-a-distance, that have long been rejected by modern science. The remaining theoretical alternative is to accept the locality principle for macro events and deny that formal, computational operations are sufficient to realize a phenomenal mental state Luna, Laureano Small, Christopher (2009). Intentionality and Computationalism. A Diagonal Argument. Mind and Matter 7 (1):81-90. ( Google ) Abstract: Computationalism is the claim that all possible thoughts are computations, i.e. executions of algorithms. The aim of the paper is to show that if intentionality is semantically clear, in a way defined in the paper, then computationalism must be false. Using a convenient version of the phenomenological relation of intentionality and a diagonalization device inspired by Thomson's theorem of 1962, we show there exists a thought that canno be a computation.

Computationalism in the philosophy of mind. Philosophy Compass 4 (3):515-532. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Computationalism has been the mainstream view of cognition for decades. There are periodic reports of its demise, but they are greatly exaggerated. This essay surveys some recent literature on computationalism and reaches the following conclusions. Computationalism is a family of theories about the mechanisms of cognition. The main relevant evidence for testing computational theories comes from neuroscience, though psychology and AI are relevant too. Computationalism comes in many versions, which continue to guide competing research programs in philosophy of mind as well as psychology and neuroscience. Although our understanding of computationalism has deepened in recent years, much work in this area remains to be done Additional links for this entry: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122301402/PDFSTART Piccinini, Gualtiero (2007). Computationalism, the churchâturing thesis, and the churchâturing fallacy. Synthese 154 (1):97-120. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: The ChurchâTuring Thesis (CTT) is often employed in arguments for computationalism. I scrutinize the most prominent of such arguments in light of recent work on CTT and argue that they are unsound. Although CTT does nothing to support computationalism, it is not irrelevant to it. By eliminating misunderstandings about the relationship between CTT and computationalism, we deepen our appreciation of computationalism as an empirical hypothesis.

Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 48 (2):253-280. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: Church's thesis asserts that a number-theoretic function is intuitively computable if and only if it is recursive. A related thesis asserts that Turing's work yields a conceptual analysis of the intuitive notion of numerical computability. I endorse Church's thesis, but I argue against the related thesis. I argue that purported conceptual analyses based upon Turing's work involve a subtle but persistent circularity. Turing machines manipulate syntactic entities. To specify which number-theoretic function a Turing machine computes, we must correlate these syntactic entities with numbers. I argue that, in providing this correlation, we must demand that the correlation itself be computable. Otherwise, the Turing machine will compute uncomputable functions. But if we presuppose the intuitive notion of a computable relation between syntactic entities and numbers, then our analysis of computability is circular.

Brain symbols and computationalist explanation. Minds and Machines 5 (1):25-44. ( Cited by 4 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â Computationalist theories of mind require brain symbols, that is, neural events that represent kinds or instances of kinds. Standard models of computation require multiple inscriptions of symbols with the same representational content. The satisfaction of two conditions makes it easy to see how this requirement is met in computers, but we have no reason to think that these conditions are satisfied in the brain. Thus, if we wish to give computationalist explanations of human cognition, without committing ourselvesa priori to a strong and unsupported claim in neuroscience, we must first either explain how we can provide multiple brain symbols with the same content, or explain how we can abandon standard models of computation. It is argued that both of these alternatives require us to explain the execution of complex tasks that have a cognition-like structure. Circularity or regress are thus threatened, unless noncomputationalist principles can provide the required explanations. But in the latter case, we do not know that noncomputationalist principles might not bear most of the weight of explaining cognition. Four possible types of computationalist theory are discussed; none appears to provide a promising solution to the problem. Thus, despite known difficulties in noncomputationalist investigations, we have every reason to pursue the search for noncomputationalist principles in cognitive theory Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/index/L075451262856X7G.pdf Waskan, Jonathan (forthcoming). A vehicular theory of corporeal qualia (a gift to computationalists). Philosophical Studies . ( Google ) Abstract: I have argued elsewhere that non-sentential representations that are the close kin of scale models can be, and often are, realized by computational processes. I will attempt here to weaken any resistance to this claim that happens to issue from those who favor an across-the-board computational theory of cognitive activity. I will argue that embracing the idea that certain computers harbor nonsentential models gives proponents of the computational theory of cognition the means to resolve the conspicuous disconnect between the sentential character of the data structures they posit and the nonsentential qualitative character of our perceptual experiences of corporeal (i.e., spatial, kinematic, and dynamic) properties. Along the way, I will question the viability of some externalist remedies for this disconnect, and I will explain why the computational theory put forward here falls quite clearly beyond the useful bounds of the Chinese-Room argument Wilson, Robert A.

A.I., Scientific discovery and realism. Minds and Machines 14 (1). ( Cited by 2 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Epistemologists have debated at length whether scientific discovery is a rational and logical process. If it is, according to the Artificial Intelligence hypothesis, it should be possible to write computer programs able to discover laws or theories; and if such programs were written, this would definitely prove the existence of a logic of discovery. Attempts in this direction, however, have been unsuccessful: the programs written by Simon's group, indeed, infer famous laws of physics and chemistry; but having found no new law, they cannot properly be considered discovery machines. The programs written in the Turing tradition, instead, produced new and useful empirical generalization, but no theoretical discovery, thus failing to prove the logical character of the most significant kind of discoveries. A new cognitivist and connectionist approach by Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett and Thagard, looks more promising. Reflection on their proposals helps to understand the complex character of discovery processes, the abandonment of belief in the logic of discovery by logical positivists, and the necessity of a realist interpretation of scientific research Additional links for this entry: http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/510/mm-alai.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/u078803u28817475/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/U078803U28817475.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2004/00000014/00000001/05142090 Apter, Michael J.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: Â Â The problem of valid induction could be stated as follows: are we justified in accepting a given hypothesis on the basis of observations that frequently confirm it? The present paper argues that this question is relevant for the understanding of Machine Learning, but insufficient. Recent research in inductive reasoning has prompted another, more fundamental question: there is not just one given rule to be tested, there are a large number of possible rules, and many of these are somehow confirmed by the data â how are we to restrict the space of inductive hypotheses and choose effectively some rules that will probably perform well on future examples? We analyze if and how this problem is approached in standard accounts of induction and show the difficulties that are present. Finally, we suggest that the explanation-based learning approach and related methods of knowledge intensive induction could be, if not a solution, at least a tool for solving some of these problems Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/w67627184tv71rk6/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/W67627184TV71RK6.pdf Boden, Margaret A.

In this way computers could be used to simulate certain important aspects intelligence. Thus the information-processing model of the mind was born.

A brief survey of the scope of CI journals and books with ``computational intelligence'' in their title shows that at present it is an umbrella for three core technologies (neural, fuzzy and evolutionary), their applications, and selected fashionable pattern recognition methods. At present CI has no comprehensive foundations and is more a bag of tricks than a solid branch of science. The change of focus from methods to challenging problems is advocated, with CI defined as a part of computer and engineering sciences devoted to solution of non-algoritmizable problems. In this view AI is a part of CI focused on problems related to higher cognitive functions, while the rest of the CI community works on problems related to perception and control, or lower cognitive functions.

( Cited by 10 | Google | More links ) Abstract: The extent to which concepts, memory, and planning are necessary to the simulation of intelligent behavior is a fundamental philosophical issue in Artificial Intelligence. An active and productive segement of the AI community has taken the position that multiple low-level agents, properly organized, can account for high-level behavior. Empirical research on these questions with fully operational systems has been restricted to mobile robots that do simple tasks. This paper recounts experiments with Hoyle, a system in a cerebral, rather than a physical, domain. The program learns to perform well and quickly, often outpacing its human creators at two-person, perfect information board games. Hoyle demonstrates that a surprising amount of intelligent behavior can be treated as if it were situation-determined, that often planning is unnecessary, and that the memory required to support this learning is minimal. Concepts, however, are crucial to this reactive program's ability to learn and perform Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/q764210h47533476/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/Q764210H47533476.pdf Fetzer, James H.

On the role of AI in the ongoing paradigm shift within the cognitive sciences. In M. Lungarella (ed.), 50 Years of AI . Springer-Verlag. ( Google | More links ) Abstract: This paper supports the view that the ongoing shift from orthodox to embodied-embedded cognitive science has been significantly influenced by the experimental results generated by AI research. Recently, there has also been a noticeable shift toward enactivism, a paradigm which radicalizes the embodied-embedded approach by placing autonomous agency and lived subjectivity at the heart of cognitive science. Some first steps toward a clarification of the relationship of AI to this further shift are outlined. It is concluded that the success of enactivism in establishing itself as a mainstream cognitive science research program will depend less on progress made in AI research and more on the development of a phenomenological pragmatics Additional links for this entry: http://froese.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/on-the-role-of-ai-in-the-ongoing-paradigm-shift.pdf Hall, John Storrs (forthcoming). Self-improving AI: An analysis. Minds and Machines . ( Google ) Abstract: Self-improvement was one of the aspects of AI proposed for study in the 1956 Dartmouth conference. Turing proposed a âchild machineâ which could be taught in the human manner to attain adult human-level intelligence. In latter days, the contention that an AI system could be built to learn and improve itself indefinitely has acquired the label of the bootstrap fallacy. Attempts in AI to implement such a system have met with consistent failure for half a century. Technological optimists, however, have maintained that a such system is possible, producing, if implemented, a feedback loop that would lead to a rapid exponential increase in intelligence. We examine the arguments for both positions and draw some conclusions Haugeland, John (1985). Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea. Cambridge: Mit Press.

( Cited by 11 | Google ) Abstract: This is a volume of original essays written by philosophers and scientists and dealing with philosophical questions arising from work in evolutionary biology and artificial intelligence. In recent years both of these areas have been the focus for attempts to provide a scientific, model of a wide range of human capacities - most prominently perhaps in sociobiology and cognitive psychology. The book therefore examines a number of issues related to the search for a 'naturalistic' or scientific account of human experience and behaviour. Some of the essays deal with the application of such models to particular behaviour, stressing the problems raised by consciousness, and the information to be derived from the differing capacities of animals and people; others consider more general questions about the logic of the explanations provided by these kinds of approach.

( Google | More links ) Abstract: The âgrand problemâ of AI has always been to build artificial agents of human-level intelligence, capable of operating in environments of real-world complexity. OSCAR is a cognitive architecture for such agents, implemented in LISP. OSCAR is based on my extensive work in philosophy concerning both epistemology and rational decision making. This paper provides a detailed overview of OSCAR. The main conclusions are that such agents must be capablew of operating against a background of pervasive ignorance, because the real world is too complex for them to know more than a small fraction of what is true. This is handled by giving the agent the power to reason defeasibily. The OSCAR system of defeasible reasoning is sketched. It is argued that if epistemic cognition must be defeasible, planning must also be done defeasibly, and the best way to do that is to reason defeasibly about plans. A sketch is given about how this might work Additional links for this entry: http://oscarhome.soc-sci.arizona.edu/ftp/PAPERS/OSCAR architecture.pdf Pollock, John L. (1990).

(1999). Rational cognition in Oscar. Agent Theories . ( Cited by 7 | Google | More links ) Abstract: Stuart Russell [14] describes rational agents as --Åthose that do the right thing--ï¿½. The problem of designing a rational agent then becomes the problem of figuring out what the right thing is. There are two approaches to the latter problem, depending upon the kind of agent we want to build. On the one hand, anthropomorphic agents are those that can help human beings rather directly in their intellectual endeavors. These endeavors consist of decision making and data processing. An agent that can help humans in these enterprises must make decisions and draw conclusions that are rational by human standards of rationality. Anthropomorphic agents can be contrasted with goal-oriented agents --â those that can carry out certain narrowly-defined tasks in the world. Here the objective is to get the job done, and it makes little difference how the agent achieves its design goal Additional links for this entry: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/246569.html http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=749598 http://oscarhome.soc-sci.arizona.edu/ftp/PAPERS/Rational Cognition in OSCAR.ps http://oscarhome.soc-sci.arizona.edu/ftp/OSCAR-web-page/PAPERS/Rational-Cognition-in-OSCAR.pdf http://books.google.com/books?hl=en=evRmQuZSv9eq2Wxij231iMjAfzA http://www.springerlink.com/index/a7r273h735877q41.pdf Pollock, John L.

The intuitive conception of intelligence in AI was originally highly anthropocentric. However, the internal dynamics of AI research have resulted in a divergence from anthropocentric concerns. In particular, the increasing emphasis on commonsense knowledge and peripheral intelligence (perception and movement) in effect constitutes an incipient reorientation of intuitions about the nature of intelligence in a non-anthropocentric direction.

The core point is to underline how in the same scenario both the role of philosophy on AI and role of AI on philosophy must be considered. Moreover, this framework is revised and extended in the light of the consideration of a type of multiagent system devoted to afford the issue of scientific discovery both from a conceptual and from a practical point of view Additional links for this entry: http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/Papers/Papers.by.Others/mm.viola.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/content/tun11774g3434j44/fulltext.pdf http://www.kluweronline.com/article.asp?PIPS=5142084=1 http://www.springerlink.com/index/TUN11774G3434J44.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2003/00000013/00000004/05142084 Simon, Herbert A.

Integrated A.I. Systems. Minds and Machines 17 (1). ( Google | More links ) Abstract: The broad range of capabilities exhibited by humans and animals is achieved through a large set of heterogeneous, tightly integrated cognitive mechanisms. To move artificial systems closer to such general-purpose intelligence we cannot avoid replicating some subsetâquite possibly a substantial portionâof this large set. Progress in this direction requires that systems integration be taken more seriously as a fundamental research problem. In this paper I make the argument that intelligence must be studied holistically. I present key issues that must be addressed in the area of integration and propose solutions for speeding up rate of progress towards more powerful, integrated A.I. systems, including (a) tools for building large, complex architectures, (b) a design methodology for building realtime A.I. systems and (c) methods for facilitating code sharing at the community level Additional links for this entry: http://www.springerlink.com/content/y04485h9j3u8x431/fulltext.pdf http://www.springerlink.com/index/Y04485H9J3U8X431.pdf http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/mind/2007/00000017/00000001/00009055 Torrance, Steven (ed.)

Deleting the subject: A feminist reading of epistemology in artificial intelligence. Minds and Machines 10 (2). ( Google ) Abstract: Â Â This paper argues that AI follows classical versions of epistemology in assuming that the identity of the knowing subject is not important. In other words this serves to `delete the subject''. This disguises an implicit hierarchy of knowers involved in the representation of knowledge in AI which privileges the perspective of those who design and build the systems over alternative perspectives. The privileged position reflects Western, professional masculinity. Alternative perspectives, denied a voice, belong to less powerful groups including women. Feminist epistemology can be used to approach this from new directions, in particular, to show how women''s knowledge may be left out of consideration by AI''s focus on masculine subjects. The paper uncovers the tacitly assumed Western professional male subjects in two flagship AI systems, Cyc and Soar Kirsh, David (1995). The intelligent use of space. Artificial Intelligence 73:31-68. ( Google ) Abstract: The objective of this essay is to provide the beginning of a principled classification of some of the ways space is intelligently used. Studies of planning have typically focused on the temporal ordering of action, leaving as unaddressed questions of where to lay down instruments, ingredients, work-in-progress, and the like. But, in having a body, we are spatially located creatures: we must always be facing some direction, have only certain objects in view, be within reach of certain others. How we manage the spatial arrangement of items around us is not an afterthought: it is an integral part of the way we think, plan, and behave. The proposed classification has three main categories: spatial arrangements that simplify choice; spatial arrangements that simplify perception; and spatial dynamics that simplify internal computation. The data for such a classification is drawn from videos of cooking, assembly and packing, everyday observations in supermarkets, workshops and playrooms, and experimental studies of subjects playing Tetris, the computer game. This study, therefore, focuses on interactive processes in the medium and short term: on how agents set up their workplace for particular tasks, and how they continuously manage that workplace. Muntean, Ioan Wright, Cory D. (2007). Autonomy, allostasic mechanisms, and AI: a biomimetic perspective. Pragmatics and Cognition 15:489â513. ( Google ) Abstract: We argue that the concepts of mechanism and autonomy appear to be antagonistic when autonomy is conflated with agency. Once these concepts are disentangled, it becomes clearer how autonomy emerges from complex forms of control. Subsequently, current biomimetic strategies tend to focus on homeostatic regulatory systems; we propose that research in AI and robotics would do well to incorporate biomimetic strategies that instead invoke models of allostatic mechanisms as a way of understanding how to enhance autonomy in artificial systems.
