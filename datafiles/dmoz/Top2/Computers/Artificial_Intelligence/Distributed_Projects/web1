He wants to harvest it. With the facts he finds inside you, McKinstry will produce the "ultimate average person." And then he'll rent out this fellow -- to do your thinking for you. If all this sounds more like science fiction than science fact, it isn't. McKinstry , a computer scientist and an artificial intelligence expert, has embarked on a groundbreaking artificial intelligence project that aims to leverage the mind power of millions of Web surfers to teach a computer to approximate human thought. The computer is called GAC, which stands for General Artificial Consciousness. McKinstry's aim is no less than to create an artificially conscious being -- a computer that can independently think human thoughts. GAC (pronounced "Jack"), went online a month ago at McKinstry's Mindpixel Digital Mind Modeling Project website and is just an infant. But the computer will learn to act human in the same manner that a human baby learns, McKinstry said, by examining the world around it. GAC's world is the World Wide Web. The more people who talk to the baby at his website, the faster GAC will learn about the world, and the sooner he'll be able to achieve consciousness. In other words, GAC needs you. Or, more accurately, he needs your "mindpixels." McKinstry coined the term to describe what he calls the "minimum intelligent signal" of the human mind. Basically, a mindpixel is a true-false statement that will be answered the same way by all human beings. The sky is blue is an example of a basic mindpixel, as most people will respond to the statement affirmatively. But mindpixels need not necessarily be so general, McKinstry said. Indeed, for GAC to act truly human, it needs to know everything the average human being knows, and these facts are generally more specific than the color of the sky. Some other examples of mindpixels include: Cows are milk-producing animals. TRUE. Linux is a computer operating system. TRUE. Britney Spears is known to be an expert on semiconductor physics . FALSE. McKinstry wants real human beings to go to GAC's site and enter in any mindpixels they can think of. Visitors to the site are also asked to answer "true" or "false" to mindpixels that others have entered into the system. In this fashion, McKinstry said, GAC learns both the basic questions necessary to human existence, and the consensus answers to those questions. More simply, GAC learns about the world. But where, in this soup of true and false statements, will we find GAC's humanity?

 SUBSCRIBE NOW Log In Register Now Help Home Page Today's Paper Video Most Popular U.S. / Global Search All NYTimes.com Published: March 8, 2001 MARYANN RINSMA has a thing about craters. She is not a geologist, but she has recently spent much of her spare time scrutinizing 2,200 photos of Mars landscapes from her home computer. Ms. Rinsma, a respiratory therapist in Bennington, Vt., is a regular visitor to an experimental NASA Web site that asks nonscientists to label craters on Mars, the red planet. The site is one of a growing number of endeavors aimed at tapping two underutilized resources: the brainpower and the good will of millions of Web users. Other projects include sites where you can teach common sense to a computer, proofread classic literature for a free e-library and help maintain the most comprehensive directory of the Web. No experts need apply: these sites are designed specifically for nonspecialists, working alone, who supply simple information or perform basic tasks. Such projects already report a total volunteer corps of more than 100,000. Volunteers are drawn to these projects for many reasons, including altruism, the chance to join a new online social circle and intellectual curiosity. Others see them as opportunities to be part of important scientific or cultural undertakings. "I am interested in astronomy so I jumped at the chance to see pictures that few people have seen of a place that no one's been to," Ms. Rinsma said of the Mars Internet site, which has attracted more than 30,000 volunteers. "It has changed my perception of the Web as a trivial place." Large-scale Web collaborations of this sort represent a new type of volunteering, one that organizers say could play a significant role in many projects if issues like quality control are properly addressed. In particular, enlisting online users to accumulate huge stores of data about human behavior and judgments could revolutionize the development of artificial intelligence systems like speech recognition, said Dr. David Stork, chief scientist at Ricoh Innovations Inc. and founder of the nonprofit Open Mind Initiative. Open Mind volunteers can take part in more than 25 online activities to create a sort of common-sense database, feeding information into a computer based on tasks that range from the straightforward (listing objects that appear in a picture) to the thoughtful (teaching the computer about people's goals and desires). Eventually a computer with a modicum of common sense could be used for a variety of purposes, including vastly improved Web searching. Since September, more than 5,000 volunteers have contributed nearly a quarter- million entries to this database. One is Jerry Fass, a self-described "failed inventor" in Milwaukee who has added more than 3,800 common-sense pieces of information. Mr. Fass is also an active participant in the Open Directory Project, an extensive Web-site directory maintained by more than 35,000 volunteers. "I like these projects because they give me a chance to use my mind, unlike the business world," Mr. Fass said. These collaborations are widely viewed as the next step in distributed-computing projects, which break down complex computations into many smaller tasks that are parceled out via the Net to volunteers' computers. The PC's work on the tasks when idle. Such projects have become quite common, attracting millions of volunteers to endeavors like scanning radio-telescope signals for alien messages and cracking codes. Now the idea of distributed computing is being applied not to digital processing but to idle brainpower, according to Kirk Pearson, a computer engineer in Broomfield, Colo. He is a frequent volunteer who runs a comprehensive Web site on the topic. Mr. Pearson coined the term "distributed human projects" to refer to projects that depend on human expertise, not computer downtime. "Many participants in distributed computing projects are frustrated because they are eager to get their minds, not just their computers, involved," he said. The crater Web site was set up to harness uniquely human skills, like perception, by Bob Kanefsky, a software engineer and contractor at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, near Mountain View, Calif. The site tests his theory that many scientific tasks require a good eye and common sense but not much scientific training. Using photos of Mars that have already been studied by a geologist, volunteers are asked to click on areas that look like craters to confirm, by consensus, their locations and outlines. They can also classify the craters by comparing them with examples. Since the online effort began in November, more than 530,000 craters have been marked and 120,000 classified. "The amount of work done is comparable to what it took a scientist years to accomplish," Mr. Kanefsky said by e-mail. The project is expanding to include unscreened photos from the recently completed Mars Global Surveyor mission. Looking ahead, Mr. Kanefsky added that it was easy to imagine a network of humans analyzing data in real time from a spacecraft mission. The crater project does have built-in controls to make up for the volunteers' lack of expertise. Results from multiple volunteers are combined before being checked against a geologist's results. "You have to get opinions from several amateurs," Mr. Kanefsky explained, "in order to have any chance of it being as reliable as that of one trained scientist." Quality control is crucial for distributed human projects, said K. Christopher McKinstry, founder of the Mindpixel project, which is creating a database of what he calls "consensus human knowledge" that could be used to train systems known as neural nets, software that roughly mimics the way a brain works. It asks users for a true or false statement (a "mindpixel"), then to "validate" 20 statements provided by other volunteers. The validation ensures that only clear statements of truth or falsehood make it into the database, and it smokes out mischief-makers. "The Internet is a noisy place," Mr. McKinstry said via e-mail. "You need to design your system from the ground up to control this." He also believes strongly in rewarding volunteers. Everyone who contributes a mindpixel is given 20 shares in what he says will eventually become a for-profit corporation licensing its database. That has helped draw more than 34,000 participants. Not everyone believes that rewards are necessary, however. The NASA crater site, for example, offers no incentives, not even a list of the most productive volunteers, which is a common feature of collaboration sites. Stoking competitive feelings can have unintended consequences. Open Mind found that a volunteer who had made thousands of entries in the common-sense database used robot software to gain the top-user ranking. Still, Dr. Stork, of Open Mind, emphasized the importance of motivating volunteers and said financial incentives like lotteries and e-coupons might be incorporated into his site. Even more crucial, though, is making such projects more fun. "I've estimated that something like 100 million mouse clicks have been wasted on Solitaire," Dr. Stork said. "Instead of just playing a game, Web volunteers could be helping science or contributing to the world's largest software endeavor."

 The Mizore Artificial Intelligence Project Download all the cool stuff here . Neuralsim What is this, and why should I care about it? This is the result of about two years of work by one person, me, Joseph Reisinger. Basically it is a neural network that attempts to mimic some biological form (instead of an abstract representation) and in the attempt perform more complex computation efficiently. What kind functions are you solving with this? Right now there is only one simulation that provides input. Its a really simple "world" with a "creature" and lights and blocks. The creature gains "energy" when it is on a light and loses it otherwise. Very typical optimization problem. Obviously the goal of this project is not to solve only one problem, but rather a large variety, so the neural network has been abstracted from world simulation. Thats all and good, but does it work? More or less, yes. I have evolved something close to the simplest solution to the lightseeker problem. I say "close to" because the neural network is rather stochastic as a single DNA set (almost) never will grow the same pattern twice. What work are you doing now? I've noticed that you haven't done much on this since like February. I've been searching for ways to reduce the stochasticity of the network. Mainly by allowing each individual neuron to set more parameters based on evolution rather than hard setting them at the beginning. The more variables that the DNA controls the better evolved the outcome is. Another reason I haven't been working on alice lately is because I've been laying the groundwork for kozue (like Kozue from Utena), which is more of a non-classical neural net program. It will use more cellular autonoma-like methods to grow neural structures. Its cool. Izumi This project is hosted by SourceForge, they're really cool people.

His Quest? Kill Gatorade How America���s Soldiers Fight for the Spectrum on the Battlefield The Drone That Will Sail Itself Around the World Subscribe RSS Search Search Science Discoveries Two Fake Brains Better Than One A few weeks ago, computer scientist Chris McKinstry announced a plan to harness the brain power of Internet users to fuel an artificially intelligent thinking machine. Web surfers flocked to his Mindpixel Digital Mind Modeling Project website , and McKinstry's database of mindpixels -- "one-bit" pieces of knowledge -- swelled so quickly that his system became temporarily overloaded. But even though AI laymen took to McKinstry's decentralized, profit-sharing model of artificial intelligence (anyone who enters data gets a share in the company), many in the academic AI community balked at his plans. Now, it seems that the academy is changing its tune, as no less venerable an institution than MIT's Media Lab has decided to collaborate with McKinstry. "We think that the future of AI is to get the public involved," said Push Singh, an MIT graduate student in AI who runs a Media Lab project called OpenMind . Singh said that the public involvement that McKinstry has been able to spur so far -- Mindpixel already has almost 20,000 registered users -- would be an asset to OpenMind. Like Mindpixel, OpenMind is an AI machine that learns from user input. At the OpenMind website, users are presented with a series of stimuli -- photographs, phrases, or diagrams. Singh said that the computer learns "common sense" from users' aggregate response to a certain stimulus. For example, if the computer shows you a picture of a family at a picnic, you might type in, "Families like to spend time together." Someone else might write, "Picnics are fun when the weather permits." And yet another person could say, "I hope they didn't forget the Grey Poupon!" With enough such responses, some clearly more valuable than others, Singh said that the computer will learn a kind of common sense about families or picnics or mustard, and how they relate to each other. And with a little common sense, OpenMind will be able to at least approximate humanness, Sing said. But when Singh heard about McKinstry's project, and saw that it had already amassed a database of more than 175,000 mindpixels, he thought that OpenMind would benefit from a collaboration with it. According to both Singh and McKinstry, the OpenMind and the Mindpixel projects will tie their databases together "at the back end." This means that any user data entered into either of the projects will be accessible by the other. Each party emerges richer from the merger. OpenMind will almost instantly have a huge knowledge database, and McKinstry's project will be blessed with academic legitimacy. "It's nice to see some recognition from the academic AI community," McKinstry said from his home in Chile, where he operates the world's largest optical telescope . "What MIT brings to this is the prestige of the institution." Despite their collaboration, McKinstry and Singh each had no problem saying that the other's project is, ultimately, a lost cause. Indeed, just last week, Singh said that he didn't think that McKinstry was "embracing the open-source movement," since his project is commercial. After speaking to McKinstry extensively over the weekend, Singh had changed his opinion a bit, saying that "Chris is a good guy" and that he appreciates McKinstry's enthusiasm. But Singh said that he still didn't think that McKinstry's "neural network" of one-bit facts would result in AI. He added that his project was superior to McKinstry's because it not only elicits facts from users, but also "the justifications for those facts." McKinstry, for his part, was equally critical of Singh's project. "(OpenMind) reminds me of where I was with this project six years ago," he said a bit dismissively, explaining that OpenMind lacked any way to ensure the "integrity" of the data users entered into the system. "Anyone can put in anything, and it isn't subject to validation," he said. McKinstry's project, by contrast, requires users to "validate" the data entered in by other users. Despite their differences, though, both scientists said that they thought the other's heart was in the right place. And neither doubted that each project -- and, if the machines come alive, mankind itself -- would benefit from this collaboration, this true meeting of databases.
